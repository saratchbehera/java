Learning Lessons fromStudent Protests from Berkeley in ‘64 to Paris in‘68Jean-Pierre Worms*Demonstrations; France; Human rights; Jurisprudence; Political activities; Students; United StatesOver within a few months, the student protests in Paris fifty years ago and those of Berkeley four yearsbefore shook the world and transformed our understanding of the human right to protest. Those movementsclearly established that freedom of association and assembly form the bedrock of a democratic societyand are ignored at society’s peril. They proved the power of protest as an engine for change. Thiscompelling Opinion piece tells the story of those protests by someone who was there. The author exploresthe roots of those protest movements, what happened during them, their immediate consequences andreflects upon their wider impact and their relevance today. The result is an engrossing read by one ofFrance’s pre-eminent sociologists where the events of fifty years ago come vividly to life.The following Opinion reflects on events which took place fifty plus years ago in which I was personallyinvolved. This year, 2018, we celebrate a pivotal moment in the history of protest, the Paris student revoltof May 1968. Four years earlier an equally momentous expression of student protest had occurred inBerkeley, California. When juxtaposed, the Berkeley and Paris student protests reveal an important storywhich merits the retelling. What were these events: a renaissance, a revolution or an irrelevance, but onethat led to a rebirth of the forces of reaction?What is not in dispute is that the beat of these protests pulsatedacross the globe. Those protests became the catalyst which informed future events. They brought thehuman right to protest to life. They became the backdrop to the last half of the 20th century. Togetherthey challenge the sociologist as well as the social and political activist which, simultaneously, I alwayswas. They may also be particularly useful in questioning the present state of our societies.I. My Personal Involvement in the Berkeley and Paris Student RevoltsBerkeley, Autumn 1964I had just joined the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) a year before when, in 1963, a verygenerous American foundation offered me a scholarship that would give me the opportunity to meet andwork with American sociologists who researched in areas similar to mine. There were a fair number ofthese, particularly in the Universities of Berkeley, Chicago and Harvard. I asked to have a placement ateach of these three universities and I was accepted. I did not hesitate to leave France and the CNRStemporarily.* Jean-Pierre Worms is a French sociologist: as part of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) he worked on local government inMichel Crozier’s Centre de Sociologie des Organisations (CSO). He held various political mandates: local ones in Burgundy (economic development),at the National Assembly (decentralisation, minimum income), at the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly (migrants’ and minorities’ rights).He has also held numerous voluntary positions (human rights, local development, social and political empowerment of the poor).1[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsI arrived in Berkeley in late August 1964 to begin an 18-month immersion in American society andsociology.Fifteen days later the University was “occupied” by students, an occupation that lasted over twomonths.These events, soon to be known as the “Free Speech Movement” (FSM), had a considerable impact overthe following years both on other student movements and on all sorts of social movements in Berkeleyand California. These soon spread across the rest of the United States, into Europe, and notably in Parisin May 1968.It’s worth recalling the context of American politics and society at the time. A year before PresidentKennedy had been assassinated. America was still deeply traumatised. After the dark years ofMcCarthyism,and regardless of what JFK’s real political record may have been, his presidency had allowed along-suppressed breathing space to open up, a space of daring cultural, social and political innovation.New stars of anti-establishment song appeared (Bob Dylan, Joan Baez). New social movements emerged(hippies with the “Flower Children” in San Francisco). Women’s liberation movements grew with arenewed vigour and so did other sexual liberation movements. And long standing older political strugglesalso experienced a boost of energy: struggles for African Americans’ social and political rights, andresistance to the Vietnam War among others.Young Americans and students, particularly at Berkeley, were at the forefront of all these protests.1964 was an election year. Despite conditions of extreme violence, a campaign was organised to helpblack voter registration in the Southern States. Many Berkeley students took part in it, including MarioSavio who was to become the most charismatic leader of the FSM.Berkeley University’s rules prohibited political activities on campus. A space was provided for thispurpose, outside the Bancroft entrance to the campus on a piece of public sidewalk which, in fact, belongedto the University. This so-called “Bancroft Plaza” was traditionally littered with tables staffed by studentsand covered with political and other social literature.For reasons still incomprehensible to this day, this “toleration” was withdrawn and, on 14 September,sanctions were initiated by the University against offenders. The next day tables appeared not only onBancroft Plaza but inside the campus, in front of Sproul Hall—the central administrationbuilding—including a table set up by one of the most determined civil rights activists, Jack Weinberg.When a university police officer arrested him and dragged him to a police car, students who had witnessedthe arrest immediately sat in front of the car to stop it from taking Jack away. Within minutes some 3,000students joined them. The siege of the police car and its occupants lasted several days; its roof served asa platform from which to deliver speeches or songs, from which the occupation of the university wasorganised, and from which to inform students about the course of the occupation and the progress ofnegotiations regarding new rules and principles for the University. The student occupation of the campuslasted until December.Having been a French student leader in the recent past and being still deeply involved in various issuesconcerning civil, social and political rights and particularly in anti-VietnamWar activities, I was obviouslyfascinated by what was taking place in Berkeley. I got to knowmany of the student leaders and particularlyMario Savio, who became a friend.Paris, May 1968Back in Paris in early 1966 I had returned to my lab, the Centre de Sociologie des Organisations (CSO),which Michel Crozier had launched in1962. I had been his first research assistant and was now the seniormember of the lab. Crozier was also teaching at Nanterre University, on the outskirts of Paris. DanielCohn-Bendit, who was to become the most charismatic leader of the May 68 student revolt, was one ofhis students! Dany, as he soon came to be called, was a self-proclaimed “libertarian-liberal”, highly resistantto any form of disciplinary coercion. Involved in the movement against the war in Vietnam and for various2 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorscivil and social rights, he had also organised a number of demonstrations against Nanterre University’sconservative organisational and socio-political structures. Among his most recent protests, he had notablybroken the rule prohibiting the presence of boys in girls’ dorms!On the night of 22 March he led a group occupation of the University’s Council premises to demandthe release of members of the Vietnam committee who had been arrested. The action took a dramatic turnand Dany’s “March 22Movement” was born. Numerous other incidents followed at Nanterre until 2 May,when it was decided to close the University. The next day Dany and other student leaders from Nanterretook their activism to the Sorbonne, in the heart of the Latin Quarter of Paris. Dany’s March 22Movementwas joined by older and more established left and extreme left political youth organisations, giving birthto the “Mouvement de Mai”.One by one the other universities of the Latin Quarter were occupied, countless meetings and assembléesgénérales were organised, pavements were demolished and barricades erected. Street demonstrations ledto violent confrontations with the police culminating in extreme violence during the night of 10 and 11May.There are many reasons why I felt personally involved in these events: the director of my lab, MichelCrozier, was teaching at Nanterre University where it all started and had Dany Cohn-Bendit among hisstudents; the Sorbonne which became the strategic centre of the May 68 movement was the universitywhere I had studied and been a student leader from 1957 to 1960; and, to top it all, Dany Cohn-Bendithappened to be the young brother of Gaby Cohn-Bendit who had beenmy best friend during those formativeyears. Unsurprisingly, when the time came, it was my wife, Miriam, who gathered the necessary signaturesfrom major social and political personalities in order to have the ban lifted forbidding Dany, a Germannational, from setting foot again on French soil as punishment for his role in May 1968.However, I was less directly involved with the students than I had been four years before in Berkeley.Unlike the US and most other countries, academic research in France is institutionally separated fromuniversities. Hence, during the May “events”, I was busy with practical considerations for the“self-government” of my lab, the CSO and presiding over the Comité d’Action of the CNRS to draft newstatutory rules for scientific research in France.In many ways, the historical context of the May 68 student revolt in Paris is not dissimilar to that ofthe FSM in Berkeley. The deep social and political trauma of the Algerian war, still vivid among studentsin Paris, could be compared with the trauma of the Vietnam War for Berkeley students and memories ofthe risk of a military coup in France at the end of the Algerian war were not unlike those surroundingJFK’s assassination. And what is more, new social, cultural and political attitudes prevalent in the USAin 1964 can be compared with similar social trends in France in 1968: years of economic growth had maderoom for profound changes in cultural moods and innovative social mores: new “Yéyé” singers, “newwave” film directors, sexual liberation movements, “new left” political parties.But the most interesting thoughts to be derived from the comparison of the two student movementsconcern their own intrinsic similarities and their relevance to today’s socio-political and socio-culturalsituation.II. Intrinsic Similarities Between Berkeley And ParisIn Berkeley, as in Paris, movements of considerable magnitude were provoked by minor, even ludicrousincidents: a prohibition on the distribution of political literature at the entrance of Berkeley University;the ban on boys entering Nanterre University girls’ dorms! None of these, obviously, tell us anything ofsignificance about the importance of what happened in Berkeley in 1964 or in Paris in 1968.In both cases, buried in the depths of American and French societies, important social, cultural andpolitical changes had already been at work for some time, loaded with potential sources of social tensionsand conflicts. It only needed a spark to start a fire that could spread into a conflagration. It happened inOpinion 3[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsBerkeley and in Paris four years later. It is often the case that important historical upheavals have anecdotalbeginnings.What were the social tensions and potential conflicts that started in Berkeley and grew to anotherdimension later in Paris?The Status of the UniversityTo students in both Berkeley and Paris the role, organisation and operating mode of the university seemedsingularly obsolete. In the US, and specifically in Berkeley, as in France, the prevailing idea at the timewas that access to “real” knowledge for students required the university to be distanced and, possibly,even detached from political and social commitments related to the issues of the day. The need for afrontier between university and society, the principle of academic political “neutrality”, was explicitlystated in Berkeley where it took the form of a ban on political activities on campus.In the guise of “Republican elitism” it was much more pernicious in France.French universities, like all the other institutions of the Republic, are based on the notion that societyneeds to generate an elite in order to be properly governed. Since Voltaire such an elite is defined by itsprivileged access to the “lights of universal reason” and by its abstraction from any concrete socialspecificity. Thus, the role of the University is precisely that of selecting and training the elite who will beable to govern the Nation, rationally and justly. Hence the need for its detachment from civic, social orpolitical involvement. Pierre Bourdieu gave a clear demonstration how such a concept of republican elitismensured the reproduction of a ruling class, its claim of a free and open access to higher education makingit all the more effective.However, such selective access to university faced the unavoidable challenge of democratisation as theresult of the fantastically accelerated demographic growth of France post-World War II. Democratisation,in 1968, was the result of three quantitatively measurable factors: an important resurgence of birth ratesafter World War II, a decrease in mortality in the same period and the return to French soil of nearly amillion French settlers from Algeria after its independence in 1962. In 25 years the French populationgrew by almost a third. To this quantitative demographic growth should be added the effects on the demandfor higher education of the rapid urbanisation of a population that had remained predominantly rural inthe first half of the century. Quite apart from any political intention, these simple facts resulted in athree-fold increase of college and student populations in the ten years before 1968.In and of itself, such demographic pressure shook to the very roots the foundations of universityinstitutions unable to accommodate it. Their inadequacy was first seen in terms of physical capacity; hencethe rush to build new universities like Nanterre. These newcomers undoubtedly lacked the personalityand spirit of tradition of older universities, but, just like the older ones, they proved to be profoundlyinadequate in their structures and modes of operation to deal with the needs and expectations of the newstudent population. Teaching methods were not adapted to vast student attendance and became more andmore depersonalised. Students experienced their anonymity as a humiliating alienation, added to thefinancial difficulties of youngsters, the vast majority of whomwere no longer the wealthy “heirs” of oldentimes.Criticisms of university bureaucratic and pedagogic inadequacy existed also in Berkeley, but they playeda much larger role in student mobilisation in Paris. However, both in Berkeley and Paris, they were secondto the social, cultural and political issues of the times which were the main fuel of student revolts.4 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsNew Issues and New Forms of Political InvolvementNew IssuesThese issues tended to be more specific and concrete than those with which national political debates wereconcerned but, at the same time, addressed fundamental questions by and large ignored in the moreshort-sighted political debates surrounding elections. This was obviously the case in Berkeley because ofthe moral as well as practical involvement of students in the protests against the VietnamWar or for civiland social rights of African Americans. Four years later, concerns for similar issues can be noted in thepolitical involvement of Paris’ student populations. The VietnamWar is still raging and, although Franceis not directly involved, French students feel personally concerned, not only for general ideological orgeo-political reasons, but also because of what their parents’ generation had experienced in the Frenchwars in Indochina and more recently in Algeria, two inglorious post-colonial conflicts still very much partof students’ moral historical awareness in 1968.Similarly, the protests of Berkeley students in support of the civil, social and political rights of AfricanAmericans and more generally against all forms of racism resonate immediately with French students’similar anti-racist struggles in support of the civil, social and political rights of immigrants from theMaghreb, Sub-Saharan Africa or Indochina.In addition, a number of common social and cultural battles took place on both sides of the Atlantic inwhich students from Berkeley and Paris were involved: women’s rights, gay and lesbian rights, urbanstruggles, new forms of democracy, and many other social and cultural rights.Both American and French students refuse to accept the continuing isolation of their universities andtheir teachings from the rest of society. Deeply concerned and personally involved in the fundamentalissues of a world they aim to help build and make their own, they want to bring these issues with them touniversity. They want society, their society, to live and grow within the walls of their university.New Forms of Political InvolvementIt is important, first, to consider the very particular form of leadership of these two student movements.Neither Mario Savio nor Dany Cohn-Bendit came from any established or recognised political parties ofthe left, whether moderate or radical. Without being politically uneducated, far from it, their charisma andtheir ability to express, represent and mobilise the power and innovative potential of their fellow studentscame precisely from this lack of an anchor in the more traditional organisations of the left. But it was alsotheir emergence from the margins which, on the one hand, brought both of them into serious conflict withpolitical allies within their own movements, in terms of tactics, strategy and even their very existence,and, on the other hand, fuelled mistrust and even personalised hostility on the part of self-proclaimedprogressive members of existing political parties: Democrats or Republicans in the States, communists,socialists or centrists in France. What is more, neither Mario nor Dany felt able to pursue a political careerdespite the fact that, as students, they had shown exceptional leadership qualities: Mario gave up politicsall together; Dany, rejected by France, had to transfer his rare political acumen to Germany where he putit to good use in the Green Party in Frankfurt and in the European Parliament.There are other features common to the two student movements in terms of the types of direct actionthey preferred and the forms of organisation they chose. “You must understand”, Mario Savio once toldme when I questioned why they did not chose more traditional types of action, “our first motive is to stuffchewing gum in Coca Cola machines.” It says it all about the sort of collective action which would emergein Berkeley and Paris. Essentially these actions would:Opinion 5[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors• be rooted in immediate and concrete personal exasperation and the anger of individualsagainst existing ideologies and hierarchical, authoritarian collective organisations and thusgive due recognition and legitimacy to subjective aspects of individual involvement;• not try to translate these demands for personal recognition into abstract general formulationsbut into concrete proposals and open spaces for free individual expression;• not try to channel or formalise individual expressions into a common minimum syntheticstandard (hence the diversity and creativity of slogans, signs, posters, songs producedovernight by unknown members of the crowd);• make room for symbolic forms of action in preference to more traditional ones: speakingfrom the roof of a police car, occupying administrative premises, invading a policy meetingetc;• welcome different points of view and different organisations in decision-making bodies andfavour long debates in order to construct a consensus rather than majority voting whichcould be open to all sorts of manipulation and/or formalisation of pre-established ideologicaldivisions.III. What Were the Results of 1964 and 1968?ThenThe contrast is striking between, on one side, the brevity and fragility of these two events and, on theother, the importance and duration of their impact. Neither the FSM nor the May 68 movement wouldlast long: just two months for the FSM, less than a month and a half for May 68. Their dynamism couldnot survive the tensions arising from conflicting strategies and microscopic quarrels between chapels ofthe small leftist, Trotskyist, Maoist groups associated with them.A question remains: is collective creativity necessarily short lived? What would be the conditions forlong-term stability compatible with sustained cultural, social and political innovative capability?A violent political backlash rapidly took form in both Berkeley and Paris. The “political class” and thebourgeoisie were literally petrified with fear by the appearance in public and the massive entry into thepolitical arena of a youth movement which did not respect any of the rules of the established politicalgame. They saw it as a conspiracy and a subversive threat to basic democratic balances. And they respondedvigorously.In California, the November 1964 election saw a sharp turn to the right and the election of a RepublicanSenator, a second-rate Hollywood actor/dancer/singer/comedian, with limited political skills but stronglyreactionary views: I remember him explaining the need to continue using Mexican manpower for cropharvesting in California because, being smaller than “true” Americans, they were closer to the ground.Two years later, another reactionary Hollywood actor was elected as governor of California, RonaldReagan, whose ultra-liberal economic ideology was later to leave its mark for decades on the evolutionof the World.In Paris, politics also turned sharply to the right in the last days of May 1968. Things had deterioratedwithin the student movement. The Communist Party’s distrust of what they saw as Dany’s provocativetactics and a resulting student collective irresponsibility had turned to hostility. Leftist groups had turnedto more extreme tactics. The risk of violent confrontations with the police increased (so far they had beencontrolled thanks to the pacifying influence of a remarkable police commissioner, the Préfet MauriceGrimaud). Faced with this dangerous situation and the rapidly diminishing support of the public a numberof personalities and leaders of moderate left-wing political parties and trade unions called for a meetingon 27 May in Chaletty sport stadium. Pierre Mendes-France took part hoping that his silent presence6 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorswould discourage violent actions from all sides. The meeting was a success: the stadium was full; noviolence erupted.For his part, General de Gaulle, in a move to regain control of the situation, made a dramatic visit to aFrench military base in Germany on 29May, addressing the Nation from there to announce the dissolutionof the National Assembly and call for national general elections in June. The next day, 30 May, 500,000people marched on the Champs Élysées to express their hostility towards the student movement andsupport for de Gaulle. The elections of 23 and 30 June gave the right an overwhelming victory that wouldhave been unthinkable two months earlier.On one level, politically, the FSM andMay 68 movement were quickly and dramatically defeated. But,even in the very short term, their other gains were quite notable.In Berkeley itself, substantial changes were implemented to the University’s modus operandi andstudents gained an extension of their rights and better representation in the running of the University. Butthe most important result of their action was the impact of the dynamics of their movement way beyondthe walls of their university, to all other American universities in the following three years and to numeroussocial and cultural movements in other areas and throughout American society. Struggles for new individualand collective rights and for the extension of existing ones found in the FSM a source of inspiration andstimulation. Over the following years the rights of African Americans; of other ethnic, social and culturalminorities; of homosexuals and of many other groups were in someway directly the heirs of this remarkablemovement for the freedom of speech. I even sometimes wonder if the hopes the Obama presidency set inmotion in America and across the world were not in a small part an extension of the hopes of the Berkeleystudents’ Free Speech Movement.The short-term victories of the Paris May 68 movement are much more significant.After the June elections Edgar Faure was appointedMinister of Education in the new government.Withthe intelligence and tactical skills that were his trademark he introduced a series of reforms in universities’procedures, processes and structures, opening new channels for student participation capable of satisfyingthe participants of May 68. He accelerated the building of new universities and promoted organisationaland teaching experiments in some of them, most notably in Vincennes. In short, he introduced a numberof innovations, some structural, others more superficial but with strong symbolic value, with which hehoped to defuse future student revolts.But by far the most important impact of the student May 68 revolt was outside the world of academia.The student movement had opened wide breaches for other than student demands. The labour movementrushed to make use of them. Strikes had occurred in all sectors of the economy, rapidly leading to a generalstrike. By 22 May seven million workers were on strike. The focus was on qualitative demands for betterrepresentation of workers in a number of important negotiating or decision-making bodies and procedures.The pressure was also and mainly on quantitative demands for significant pay increases long stifled, butwhich 20 years of growth could obviously now satisfy. The government of Georges Pompidou hastenedto satisfy these labour demands in the hope of putting an end to workers’ solidarity with students beforethe ultimate showdown with the student movement. And it worked. Negotiations on 25 and 26 May ledto the “Grenelle agreements”, opening the way to better representation of workers in a number of instancesand to important wage increases: 10 per cent on average and 35 per cent on the minimum wage.The most significant immediate result of theMay 68 student revolt led to the breaking of student/workersolidarity and paved the way for a considerable political defeat of the left a month later.And NowWhat remains today of these considerable social upheavals, fifty years after May 68 in Paris and fifty-fouryears after the Berkeley FSM?The state of the world could hardly be more different.Opinion 7[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsWe are no longer enjoying the benefits of a long period of strong economic growth, allowing audaciousintellectual, cultural and social changes and justifying the demands of youth to break down the barriersof the old world that block, impede or slow their full development.We are no longer at the end of a historical movement of decolonisation and the emergence of democraticrights for peoples in the process of political emancipation.And, finally, we are no longer in a geo-political context where international institutions seem able tocontain the risks of major conflicts between super powers or of a global breakdown of world peace. Inshort, the time for optimism is behind us.Today we wonder whether we are really coming out of one of the most traumatic world financial andeconomic crises for decades and whether we will not have to face an even worse one in the near future.Today violence between nation states still appears to be contained but world peace seems more fragilein the hands of world leaders avid for power and whose rationality (if there is such a thing in the case ofDonald Trump?) is not always easy to decipher.Today violence within a single state is on the rise and far from contained: terrorism, civil wars, ethnicconflicts, religious conflicts. Many wars are no longer fought between soldiers of armies of differentcountries but between civilians of the same country. Civilians have become the main victims, targets andactors of such conflicts. The potential for extreme violence and barbarity has always existed in all humansocieties. It was unleashed between the major states in the last two World Wars. It has now moved intothe hands of civil societies.And, today, what are all these threats compared to environmental ones? For the first time in humanhistory serious scientists question humanity’s chances of survival in a foreseeable future unless drasticchanges occur rapidly in the form and content of our economic and social development.To face challenges of such magnitude, the capabilities of our democratic institutions seem singularlyinadequate. Even in some European countries (Poland, Hungary, Austria) democracy is in serious danger.The situation in Russia, China, Turkey and many other African or Asian countries is not more reassuring.And what about the state of democracy in Trump’s America and in Brexit Great Britain, historically thetwo main pillars of democratic progress? And what about France where the hopes of a new politicaldemocratic system rest on the collapse of the two political forces which, for the last 70 years, providedthe basic structure of French democracy?Serious concerns about the future darken our social horizons; the audacity of optimism has given wayto rational and emotional pessimism. This can lead to populist and/or authoritarian forms of governmentand to the cautious withdrawal of citizens towards the most hackneyed conservatism or towards the frenzyof accumulation and rapid renewal of perishable goods.Paradoxically, however, there is also in our society a profusion of initiatives by citizens who take uponthemselves the responsibility of building, here and now and piece by piece, the sort of society they wantto leave to future generations, a society capable of answering the challenges of times to come. A societymore respectful of natural resources and of each individual, more just and more friendly. This takes placein every area of social life. Everywhere citizens are already actively inventing new ways of bringing upa family, of educating children and taking care of the old, of growing food and feeding themselves,experimenting in new relations with work, with cultural activities, with the world and with their immediateneighbourhood etc.The values that inspire such initiatives are very close to those of Mario Savio or Dany Cohn-Bendithalf a century ago. Today we would recognise these values as underpinning the global human rightsmovement: respect for individual freedom and personal responsibility in producing the common good ofa shared society; distaste for all forms of coercion and a taste for dialogue between people of differentopinions and cultural backgrounds as the basis for group cohesion, moving through specific and concrete8 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsexperience towards general ideas and abstract concepts and theories regarding academic rights, socialrights, economic rights, political rights and civil rights.Even more than is the case with other principles of government, two forces must combine to give humanrights their effectiveness and their power. On the one hand, obviously they need the authority of higherprinciples inscribed in constitutions, international treaties and other legal documents that have precedenceover ordinary institutional documents or contractual agreements. But on the other hand, citizens mustrecognise their practical utility and adopt them as their own principles in order to grant them the sociallegitimacy they need to be effective. Without both, those charged with their implementation might distortthe structures of human rights principles and potentially citizens might seek to avoid or bypass them; andthen leading to a possible democratic crisis. When society is changing rapidly, the social legitimacy of itsfundamental laws must be periodically revisited and reconstructed.This was precisely the problem universities in Berkeley and Paris were facing when, given theobsolescence of their basic rules, they were confronted with the changing needs of society and demandsof their student citizenry. Revisiting the history and lessons of the FSM and of May 68 is essential. ThisOpinion piece shares my recollections of the events. These reflections are not a rigorous academic study,but they are intended to capture an extraordinary moment in 20th century history which I was privilegedto witness. As we observe and inevitably commend the events of May ’68 in Paris this year, I attempt toassess some of the causes and consequences of what took place and why. At the heart of the events inboth Berkeley and Paris was the power of protest. The rights to assembly and association unleash a potencythat can transform and enhance democracy. The true legacy of May ’68 in Paris is the affirmation of thepower of protest and the form of democratic society that was ushered in as a consequence.Opinion 9[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsPoint of ViewBrexit, human rights and the constitutional futureof these islandsColin HarveySchool of Law, Queen’s University BelfastBrexit; Constitutional law; Equal treatment; European Union; Human rights; Northern IrelandMany predicted that Brexit would have a destabilising impact on relationships across these islands. Thefact that these assessments turned out to be correct is of little comfort now. One of the more intriguingaspects of the discussion, however, is the renewed attention being paid to the situation in Northern Ireland,as well as questions around human rights in general.1 This includes a debate on the future of the EUCharterof Fundamental Rights. As will be explained, these matters are now bound together.Who would have thought that Brexit would lead to EU-wide endorsement of the Belfast/Good FridayAgreement 1998?2 It is hard to read the “Ireland/Northern Ireland” section of the Joint Report on Phase1 of the negotiations in any other way.3 The risk in this is that casual references to that Agreement mightdiscourage attention to detail, and avoidance of hard constitutional, legal and political realities. TheAgreement is a multi-party political agreement but it is also underpinned by international law (a bi-lateralBritish-Irish Agreement4) and that component can be neglected. As it advances through the Brexit process,the UK Government is legally bound by this international agreement and remains (with the IrishGovernment) a co-guarantor. With that in mind, there are a few things to underline.First, human rights and equality are at the heart of the 1998 Agreement. When people refer to thisdocument is it essential that they are reminded of this. It is also vital to recall that substantial projects from1998, including a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland and a Charter of Rights for the island of Ireland, areadrift with no responsibility currently being taken for their practical advancement. As if this was notworrying enough, once the Conservative Party has taken care of Brexit it plans to revisit its promise torepeal and replace the Human Rights Act 1998.5 The failure to deliver on this promise thus far should notdeceive us into complacency. Where will attention turn once liberation from the EU has been secured? Itwould be foolish to believe that rights and equality guarantees (for EU citizens, for example) will necessarilystick or to trust in promises that are not firmly nailed down now. In these discussions, future enforcementand implementation must be in our minds. The limits of the UK’s flexible constitution are well knownand this fact is an ever-present risk to basic guarantees. The Joint Report is clear that the UK Governmentwill ensure that there will be “no diminution” of rights in Northern Ireland as a result of Brexit.6 It is alsoplain that the intention is that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will retain rights as EU citizens (as one1Explained also, of course, by the “Confidence and Supply Agreement” between the DUP and the Conservative Party, www.gov.uk/government/publications/conservative-and-dup-agreement-and-uk-government-financial-support-for-northern-ireland/agreement-between-the-conservative-and-unionist-party-and-the-democratic-unionist-party-on-support-for-the-government-in-parliament [Accessed 15 December 2017].2The Belfast Agreement, 10 April 1998, www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-belfast-agreement [Accessed 15 December 2017].3 Joint report from the negotiators of the EU and the UK government on progress during phase 1 of negotiations under art.50 of the TEU on theUK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU, https://ec.europa.eu/commission/publications/joint-report-negotiators-european-union-and-united-kingdom-government-progress-during-phase-1-negotiations-under-article-50-teu-united-kingdoms-orderly-withdrawal-european-union_en [Accessed 22January 2018].4 See http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/pdf/2000/TS0050.pdf [Accessed 22 January 2018].5Forward Together: Our Plan for a Stronger and a Prosperous Future: The Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2017, www.conservatives.com/manifesto [Accessed 22 January 2018], p 37.6 See fn.3 above at para.53.1[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorspart of respecting the right to choose to be Irish or British or both).7 Work will continue in the negotiationswithin the separate strand that is considering Ireland/Northern Ireland matters. But this raises an immediatequestion. The decision of the UK Government to remove the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights appearsto be in breach of these commitments (as they relate to Northern Ireland).Second, the Agreement is structured around relationships across these islands. Its values and principlesare intended to be embedded within linked institutions, including the Northern Ireland Assembly andExecutive, the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-IrishIntergovernmental Conference (among others). There have been changes since 1998, and the politicaldynamic has altered significantly. But that sort of relational thinking (anchored in respect for human rightsand equality) is badly needed again. Brexit has rocked the foundations and plunged everyone into a stateof heightened constitutional anxiety. Those who suggest that this is an overreaction miss how much faithpeople had invested in the “constitutional fundamentals” of the peace process in Northern Ireland. It isonly by securely returning to those “fundamentals” that a sustainable future is possible, and that meanscontinuing respect for the vision of human rights and equality outlined in the 1998 Agreement.Third, there is a neglected and misunderstood human rights component. It is the option of “the peopleof the island of Ireland” to exercise “their right of self-determination”.8 The formula is complex and wasworked out over decades. There must be no “external impediment” and it must be based on “consent,freely and concurrently given” in both jurisdictions.9 Northern Ireland has a lock on the process, “as thisright must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of thepeople of Northern Ireland”.10 The current democratic will rests Northern Ireland within the UK (for now),and “status as part of the United Kingdom reflects and relies upon that wish”.11 If, however, the right ofself-determination is exercised in the way outlined, and the outcome is agreement in both jurisdictions,then there is a “binding obligation” on both governments to “introduce and support legislation … to giveeffect to that wish”.12 The right is recognised in international law (British-Irish Agreement) and reflectedin domestic law in both states (in the Irish Constitution and in the Northern Ireland Act 1998). As is wellknown, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 gives the Secretary of State a key decision-making role for NorthernIreland (“the Secretary of State shall exercise the power … if at any time it appears likely to him that amajority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the UnitedKingdom and form part of a united Ireland”).13 The adopted formulation remains intriguing. Why is thisright of self-determination so significant now? Because one way for Northern Ireland to remain in the EUis to leave the UK. Stating this is likely to invite quite strong reactions, and that is troubling. If, as so manynever tire of observing, the constitutional status of Northern Ireland rests on consent alone then what isthe problem with testing it? The responses can be unintentionally revealing, because they suggest that thisaspect of the Agreement is in fact not really accepted. There is much about the debate over this right thatis open for discussion, and the challenges are real. The point is that Ireland and Northern Ireland alreadyhave an agreed mechanism for exercising this right of self-determination (in a world where even that isa fundamentally contested notion). As well as insisting that “no diminution” has immediate implicationsfor the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, it is also time to normalise this aspect of the “consent conversation”,especially when there is such current fondness for the 1998 Agreement. It is vital to be clear about whatis being said and not said. The priority remains securing specific solutions that fully respect the specialconstitutional status that Northern Ireland already has (remember too that Northern Ireland voted toremain). However, if no specific solutions can be found to accommodate these unique circumstances then7 See fn.3 above at para.52.8 See fn.2 above, “Constitutional Issues”, para.1.9 See fn.2 above,

It was held that the applicantscould not rely on the Charter because they were not EU nationals and the reasons for refusalof access were pursuing a legally permitted aim and proportionate to the objective pursued.Article 41• Aurora v OCVV – SES Vanderhave (M 02205) (T-140/15), 23 November 2017, where aCommunity plant variety right was granted by the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO),but the applicant sought to contest this on grounds that the plant variety lacked distinctness.The claim was initially rejected so upon further appeal it was argued that a careful andimpartial examination of all relevant particulars had to be carried out. The appeal was upheld.Articles 41, 48, 49• Icap and Others v Commission (T-180/15), 10 November 2017, voice and electronicinterdealer brokers involved in LIBOR and TIBOR rate manipulations on the Japanese Yeninterest rate derivatives market were fined for infringement of competition law, which theyappealed. Their argument that the offences were not clearly defined was rejected, and theirregularity arising from a possible lack of objective impartiality on the part of theCommission could not have had an impact the final decision, so was also dismissed as aground of appeal.Articles 47, 48, 41(1), 17• Mabrouk v Council (T-175/15), 5 October 2017, annulment was sought of a decision thatincluded the applicant on a sanctions list against certain individuals in Tunisia on groundsthat the Council did not take a reasonable time to conclude proceedings, infringed presumptionof innocence, good administration and right to property.

It was heldthat the ne bis in idem principle does not apply to a situation in which several penalties areimposed in a single decision, even if those penalties are imposed for the same actions. Onthe requirement for a clear definition of penalties and offences in law, the challenge wasrejected because the wording of the provisions was clear and did not include indeterminateconcepts which required definition.9[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCourt of Justice of the European UnionThe Court issued, inter alia, judgments and decisions in the following during October–November 2017(all Articles refer to the EU Charter, unless otherwise specified):Articles 16, 21, 49, 50• BB construct (C-534/16), 26 October 2017, the claimant applied for registration for VATpurposes which required a EUR 500,000 guarantee for 12 months within 20 days. Claimantappealed for a reduction or annulment of this guarantee on grounds that it was against thefreedom to conduct business and was disproportionate considering its turnover. Articles 49and 50 were held to be inapplicable and art.16 was held not to be absolute. The principle ofequal treatment must be interpreted as not precluding the tax authority from requiring a newtaxable person to provide a guarantee such as that in the proceedings.Articles 20 & 47• SolarWorld v Council (C-204/16 and C-205/16 P), 9 November 2017, anti-dumping dutyimposed on the applicants for products originating or consigned from China was appealed.The Court found the claim on equality before the law to be inadmissible.

Access to Justice and theConvention1Judge Tim Eicke*Judge at the European Court of Human Rights elected in respect of the UKAccess to justice; Complementarity principle; Democracy; European Court of Human Rights; Rightof access to court; Rule of law; SubsidiarityAbstractAccess to justice in civil proceedings has been an increasingly prominent subject in judicial, extrajudicialand academic discourse. This article considers the subject from the perspective of the case-law of theEuropean Court of Human Rights. Using the recent UK Supreme Court decision in UNISON as a startingpoint, similarities in approach between Strasbourg and UK constitutional law are highlighted. By referenceto either or both courts have defended a core principle of access to justice, which must be practicallyunderstood and applied. Barriers to accessing the European Court of Human Rights itself reflect thistension between pragmatism and principle. The principle of subsidiarity should mean that the primarylocus for ensuring the right of access to justice is in national bodies, with the European Court of HumanRights acting as a “safety net”. Meaningful access to justice is a shared project for all legal professionalswhich protects and promotes democracy.Access to justice is a subject that has been well-covered recently, both as concerns formal and practicalobstacles to access to court. As such it has been addressed by Lord Neuberger in his welcoming speechto the Australian Bar Association,2 the new Irish Chief Justice, Mr Justice Frank Clarke, speaking bothjudicially3 as well as extra-judicially at the opening of the latest legal term,4 leading public lawyers,5 andwas considered at length in the Supreme Court’s judgments in theCoventry v Lawrence saga, most recentlyjudgment No.3,6 and in R. (UNISON) v Lord Chancellor.7The Supreme Court’s judgment in UNISON, given by Lord Reed, clearly sets out the right of access tojustice as an essential part of the UK constitution. He rightly reminds us that the right of access to thecourts is “inherent in the rule of law”.8 Certainly, no democracy worthy of the name can function withoutthe rule of law, which in turn requires, in order to be effective, a meaningful right of access to the courts.This article considers the right of access to a court in civil proceedings from the perspective of the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights. This is not to detract from the vital role of domestic courts, but rather seeks toreaffirm the complementarity between the judgments on this subject which have emanated from Strasbourg1Based on the ALBA Annual Lecture, delivered at the Inner Temple on 30 November 2017.*With thanks to Miranda Butler, barrister at Garden Court Chambers and stagiaire at the Court.2D.

This isemphasised in art.3 of the Statute, whereby “every Member of the Council of Europe must accept theprinciple of the rule of law”. The Council of Europe’s drafting of the Convention and establishment ofthe Court pursued this vision of “genuine democracy”, based on the rule of law.Those principles continue to inform the Court’s work and must be borne in mind as the Court facesnew and varying challenges both in relation to its caseload and the legal principles which it is the Court’stask to interpret. Protecting and promoting access to justice and the rule of law is not just the work of theCourt or the Council of Europe, but first and foremost that of national authorities.The right of access to a courtStrasbourg’s case-law has long recognised, frequently in cases emanating from the UK, the right of accessto a court as being a significant component of art.6 of the Convention. The case of Golder v UnitedKingdom was one of the first in which this issue arose.9 Mr Golder was a serving prisoner who had beenwrongly accused of participation in a prison riot and who had been denied the right to consult with asolicitor about a proposed civil action he wished to bring against the prison officer who implicated himin wrongdoing. The Court found that the Home Secretary, by refusingMr Golder’s request to consult witha lawyer, had prevented him from bringing legal proceedings and violated his rights under art.6(1).The Court noted that art.6(1) does not expressly provide for a right of access to the courts or tribunals.Rather, “it enunciates rights which are distinct from but stem from the same basic idea and which, takentogether, make up a single right not specifically defined in the narrower sense of the term”.10 The Courtput significant weight on the passage in the Preamble to the Conventionwhereby the signatory Governmentsdeclare that they are “resolved as the Governments of European countries which are like-minded and havea common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law, to take the right steps forthe collective enforcement of certain of the Rights stated in the Universal Declaration.”In this seminal judgment the Court connected the right of access to the courts with the principles onwhich the Council and the Court were founded. The Court also considered that, if the Convention did notprotect the right of access to justice, governments could arrogate to themselves the jurisdiction to determinecertain classes of civil—and one might add, public law—actions. It held that “such assumptions,indissociable from a danger of arbitrary power, would have serious consequences which are repugnant tothe [principles of access to justice and the rule of law]”.11In the absence of any express right to access to justice in the text of the Convention, the Court took apragmatic view, concluding that the express rights to fair, public and expeditious proceedings under art.6would have no value if there were no access to courts and therefore no such proceedings to begin with.This conception of the primacy of access to justice echoes Lord Diplock’s reasoning, two years earlier,in Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd that:“The due administration of justice requires first that all citizens should have unhindered access tothe constitutionally established courts …, secondly that they should be able to rely upon obtainingin the courts the arbitrament of a tribunal which is free from bias and whose decision will be basedupon those facts only that have been proved in evidence before it in accordance with the procedure9Golder v United Kingdom (1975) 1 E.H.R.R. 524.10Golder (1975) 1 E.H.R.R. 524 at [28].11Golder (1975) 1 E.H.R.R. 524 at [35].Speaking in UNISON? Access to Justice and the Convention 23[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsadopted in courts of law, and thirdly that, once the dispute has been submitted to a court of law, theyshould be able to rely upon there being no usurpation by any other person of the function of thatcourt.”12Unhindered access to the courts is the necessary predicate of a fair trial. No other body, particularly noexecutive body, should be entitled to interfere with exercise of the court’s functions. We see the sameessential reasoning applied independently by the House of Lords and then the European Court of HumanRights.Golder is an instructive example of how the Convention, emerging out of this common pan-Europeanheritage, is shaped and informed by the fundamental values at the heart of that heritage. The Court wasable to identify a right of access to the courts in much the same way as the House of Lords and SupremeCourt have done by invoking the rule of law and the dangerousness of arbitrary power. Neither courtneeded to refer to each other’s reasoning as they were drawing on the same normative values which shaped,and continue to shape, both the UK constitution and the Convention.A few years later the Court handed down another significant judgment on access to justice in Airey vIreland,13 which related to a victim of domestic violence who could not afford the costs of a judicialseparation from her abusive husband. Legal aid was not available for this or indeed any civil action. TheCourt considered that the complicated points of law raised by the case possibly required expert evidenceand witness handling. This, as well as the emotional involvement in these sorts of proceedings, meant thata person in the position ofMrs Airey would be very unlikely to be able to present their own case effectively.A violation of art.6(1) was found once again.While emphasising that the Convention did not require Member States to provide free legal aid in allcivil proceedings, the Court held that they were nevertheless obliged to ensure that legal representationwas available when such assistance was “indispensable for an effective access to court”,14 whether thiswas because legal representation was compulsory or due to the complexity of the procedure or the case.Litigants were guaranteed an effective right of access to the courts in civil matters, but the state was, inprinciple, free to choose how to achieve it. A legal aid scheme was one way of doing this but other meansof providing access were available, such as a simplification of procedure.Another of the striking features of the Airey case is the Court’s willingness to confront the economicimplications of its decision. Judges, whether at a domestic or international level, are rightly slow tointervene in this highly technical area which requires difficult (social and economic) policy choices to bemade. As Airey acknowledges, there is likely to be a range of options open to the state to enable effectiveaccess to justice. Plainly, it is not for the courts to dictate policy choices to the government. Nonetheless,the core entitlement of access to justice must be protected. The courts’ natural deference in these areasshould not restrain judges when applying the law but, in doing so, they must take a practical view andsquarely confront the potential individual as well as systemic implications of their judgments in thispolitically-sensitive area.The later case ofP, C and S v United Kingdom15 took this pragmatic approach further. This case concernedthe requirement to provide a lawyer to parents involved in complex care proceedings. The Court againreiterated that the right of access to a court is not absolute but may be subject to legitimate and proportionaterestrictions. There will only be a violation of art.6 where the “very essence of the right” of access isimpaired.16 The Court realistically acknowledged that pursuing litigation without representation is noteasy, but held that “the limited public funds available for civil actions renders a procedure of selection a12Attorney General v Times Newspapers Ltd [1974] A.C. 273 at [309].13Airey v Ireland (1979) 2 E.H.R.R. 305.14Airey (1979) 2 E.H.R.R. 305 at [26].15P, C and S v United Kingdom (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 31.16P, C and S (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 31 at [90].24 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsnecessary feature of the system of administration of justice”.17 That difficult selection procedure falls tothe state, provided they do not act arbitrarily or disproportionately.Allowing for the significant differences between domestic administrative law and the Convention, thereis a useful comparison to be drawn between cases such as P and the line of cases in which the courts ofEngland andWales have upheld the right of access to the courts. Judges considering challenges to variousbarriers to legal advice, representation and the courts have required clear justification for such interferencewith the right of access to justice.18 Some interference with the right of access to the courts has beenpermitted, but it has been held that this must meet a pressing need.In R. v Lord Chancellor, Ex p. Witham the High Court considered the Lord Chancellor’s power to setcourt fees for civil proceedings. Despite the apparently wide discretion to set such fees, they were subjectto the implied limitation that he could not “exercise the power in such a way as to deprive the citizen ofwhat has been called his constitutional right of access to the courts”.19 Under the common law, as underthe Convention, judges recognise and protect a core right of access to justice. This does not preclude theimposition of fees, costs and other barriers to court, provided they are not unduly onerous. Inherent in therule of law is an irreducible minimum right of access to the courts, and to justice more generally, whichjudges at all levels can recognise and protect.A similar approach to that in Ex p. Witham was taken at the European level in Anghel v Italy,20 wherethe Court emphasised that there was no obligation to provide legal aid for all civil proceedings. Nevertheless,it held that the state may have to provide such legal aid where, taking the relevant proceedings as a whole,the legal representation was not practical and effective. In Anghel, although legal aid lawyers had beenprovided, they had offered erroneous advice and their error had not been remedied by the courts, resultingin a lack of practical and effective representation which incurred the state’s liability under art.6(1). TheCourt insisted that the right of access to a court must be exercised in a “concrete and effective manner”.21The similarity of reasoning used by Strasbourg and by courts in the UK was the subject of commentby Lord Reed inUNISON. He rightly noted that the common law’s requirement that the degree of intrusioninto the right of access to justice be no greater than is justified by the objectives which the measure isintended to serve, is analogous to the principle of proportionality.22 This suggests that the parallels inapproach between the Supreme Court considering the UK constitution and the European Court interpretingthe Convention may be fertile ground for the development of this area of law.Today, as others have noted already, the obstacles facing modern litigants stem in part from anincreasingly complex system of laws and court procedures, which makes self-representation an ever morechallenging prospect. Against the background of diminishing legal aid budgets and increased court feesand costs, legal professionals have a responsibility to protect access to justice in two ways. Firstly, judgesmust apply and uphold the constitutional right of access to justice, whether applying the common law,the Convention or otherwise. It is important to remain alert for those cases in which what may appear tobe a mere restriction on access to justice in reality threatens to impair the very essence of a party’s rightto access to court. The Convention and the common law tell us that this is a fact-sensitive question whichrequires constant vigilance.Secondly, legal professionals must recognise their duty to facilitate access to justice in and out of thecourtroom. Judges can and do provide significant assistance and support for litigants in person and shouldbe pragmatic when it appears that procedural or other rules will likely interfere with a party’s right ofaccess to the court. Lawyers can—and of course frequently do—support the system by providing pro17P, C and S (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 31 at [90].18 See, inter alia, R.

This in no way undercuts the principleof access to court, rather it should stand as a reminder that everyone in the legal profession has a role toplay in facilitating the fundamental right of access to justice.Access to the European Court of Human RightsThe same need for a right of practical and effective access to court extends to the European Court ofHuman Rights as much as to national courts and tribunals. The Court was established to provide individualapplicants with access to a supranational forum for redress. Judgments from the Court have played acrucial role in embedding the Convention’s principles at the national level. However, as the Court hasacknowledged in Golder in respect of access to Court in the domestic context, “the right of access to thecourts is not absolute” and, as long as they do not injure the substance of the right, may be subject toregulation. In the case of the Court, these are the requirements set out in arts 34 and 35 of the Convention,including the requirement to have exhausted domestic remedies, as well as those in r.47 of the Rules ofCourt.As its caseload has grown, the Court has sought to ensure that the right of individual application remainspractical and effective while also ensuring that the objectives of the Convention are achieved.As is well known, the number of applications at the Court has risen exponentially since its creationuntil 2011 even if it has subsequently been somewhat reduced. In 1981 the Court received a mere 404registered applications, a number which had reached 4,750 in 1997 and an astonishing 151,600 applicationsby 2011.23 Even in 2017, after various changes to the Court’s procedure have been implemented, there arestill more than 60,000 cases pending before the Court.24 This surge in applications to the Court broughthome the need for a more pragmatic and rigorous approach to the fundamental principle of individuals’access to the Court. It is wholly unrealistic to expect that each of the tens of thousands of annual applicationsrequire determination by a full panel of the Court, possibly with an oral hearing. Nevertheless, that is,still, what many if not most applicants are hoping for. Given the Court’s limited budget and judicialresources, this would be patently impossible. Such an approach would have led the Court to fail in itsduties to applicants by being unable to give timely consideration to meritorious and urgent applications.Access for all would, in those circumstances, have meant effective access for none.In order to deal with this problem, in 2010, Protocol No.14 to the Convention introduced significantchanges to the Court’s procedures. It introduced systems designed to help the Court make admissibilitydecisions in straightforward cases more efficiently and without disproportionate use of judicial timethrough the use of the single judge25 or the committee procedure.26 It also introduced the “no significantdisadvantage” criterion, a de minimis rule intended to filter out cases of so little significance that they donot require the Court’s intervention.27 This criterion was, however, made subject to various safeguardswhereby an otherwise inadmissible case is admitted if respect for human rights requires an examinationof the case on its merits or where the case has not been duly considered by a domestic tribunal. This lattersafeguard is, of course, due to fall away once Protocol No.15 enters into force.Another new feature was the prioritising of urgent or important cases. This seeks to ensure that theCourt’s backlog does not result in otherwise meritorious cases becoming academic or significant injustice23Council of Europe, “Annual Report 2011 of the European Court of Human Rights”, http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Annual_report_2011_ENG.pdf [Accessed 25 January 2018].24European Court of Human Rights, “Pending applications allocated to a judicial formation 31/10/2017”, http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Stats_pending_2017_BIL.pdf [Accessed 25 January 2018].25Article 27 of the Convention and r.27A of the Rules of the Court.26Article 28 of the Convention and r.27 of the Rules of Court.27ECHR, art.35(3)(b).26 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsbeing allowed to occur while a case is pending. The Court’s approach to compliance with r.47, which setsout the requirements for a valid application, has also been significantly tightened. Where the relevantcriteria are not met the application is rejected without being considered by a judge. While, in principle,this should and does lead to a higher standard of presentation in applications and facilitates the Registry’stask in preparing meritorious cases for communication or decision there is, perhaps surprisingly, still avery significant proportion of applications from the UK which are rejected at this first hurdle.At the level of judicial decision-making, the Court has adopted a practice of accepting unilateraldeclarations by states. This is a process whereby, in appropriate cases, the Court will strike out applicationswhere a respondent government, in the form of a public declaration, clearly acknowledges that there hasbeen a violation of the Convention and undertakes to provide adequate redress and, as appropriate, to takenecessary remedial measures. However, the exercise of the Court’s strike out jurisdiction is predicated onit being satisfied that the declaration offers a sufficient basis for finding that respect for human rights doesnot require it to continue its examination of the application.28The Court has also introduced the pilot-judgment procedure, whereby repetitive cases can be stayedbehind a pilot judgment, identifying the existence of a structural or systemic problem or other similardysfunction giving rise to similar applications, while the relevant state adopts measures to satisfy the leadjudgment.29 The pilot judgment procedure was designed in response to structural or systemic rightsviolations giving rise to very high volumes of similar applications which, due to their sheer number, mayjeopardise the effective functioning of the Convention system.As the NGO JUSTICE has commented, the backlog of applications seen in the early 21st century poseda risk to the effectiveness and credibility of the entire Convention system.30 The Court was struggling todeal appropriately with somany cases and the time spent on clearly inadmissible cases became unsustainableand disproportionate. It would be a serious failure on the part of the Court if it were incapable of respondingto urgent cases quickly or allowed serious and widespread human rights abuses to go unchallenged forlong periods.The competing requirements of pragmatism, procedural strictness and access to justice have come tothe fore in the very recent judgment of the Grand Chamber in Burmych v Ukraine.31 This case arose fromsystemic failings in enforcement of domestic court decisions in the Ukraine, combined with an absenceof effective domestic remedies. The Court had given a pilot judgment in 200932 but the Ukrainiangovernment has so far failed to implement the general measures required to rectify the systemic problemand provide effective remedies. This continued failure led to the Court adopting a practice of dealing withfollow-up cases in an accelerated fashion, making grouped judgments and strike-out decisions which wereessentially limited to a statement of a violation and an award of just satisfaction. By the date of the Burmychjudgment there were more than 12,000 of such applications pending and reportedly ten times that numberof further potential applications to the Court. This backlog of cases not only imposed an unsustainableworkload on the Court and its Registry, but ran the risk of the Court operating as part of the Ukrainianlegal enforcement system, fulfilling the role which should be played by the domestic authorities.The majority in Burmych considered that it was necessary to adopt a new approach to such cases. Theyconsidered that execution of judgments was, under art.46 of the Convention, a matter for the Committeeof Ministers. The Court’s principal role was defined by art.19, namely to ensure the High ContractingParties’ observance of the Convention. This did not necessarily require it to give individual considerationto each of the pending cases. The Court decided to strike out the pending cases and any future such28Under r.62A of the Rules of the Court.29Under r.61 of the Rules of the Court, see also Broniowski v Poland [2005] 40 E.H.R.R. 21.30 JUSTICE, “Submission on the longer-term future of the system of the European Convention”, https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/cddh/reformechr/GT-GDR-F/Patrick.pdf [Accessed 25 January 2018].31Burmych v Ukraine (App. No.46852/13), judgment of 12 October 2017.32 Ivanov v Ukraine (App. No.40450/04), judgment of 15 October 2009.Speaking in UNISON? Access to Justice and the Convention 27[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsapplications, holding that there was nothing to be gained, nor would justice be served, by the Courtrepeating its findings in repetitive cases where this would have an impact on its caseload.33The minority took a sharply different view. They held that the approach championed by the majority“completely changes the well-established paradigm of the Convention system” and the principle thatConvention rights should be practical and effective.34 They criticised the majority’s decision as in breachof the Court’s judicial responsibility, denying an individualised judicial examination to pending and futurecases, which they argue undermines the effectiveness of the Convention system, the protection of individualrights and the rule of law.The changes in procedure mentioned above have inevitably attracted criticism, not least in the form ofthe powerful dissent in Burmych.35 While these concerns are understandable, a more nuanced approachto access to justice, arising from the Court’s own case law, should be applied. Provided the core of theright to access the Court in Strasbourg is protected, a realistic and pragmatic approach which givesappropriate priority to urgent and meritorious cases should be adopted. While we have yet to see whatbroader impact, if any, Burmych is likely to have, the majority’s realistic analysis of the meaning of justicehas much to recommend it. The Grand Chamber reminded us that justice may not be done more broadlyif the Court insisted on access to the Court in each individual case.The unusual course taken by the Court in Burmych is the result of non-implementation of judgmentsat the national level, which compelled Strasbourg to act. In the Declarations of Interlaken, Izmir, Brightonand Brussels the State Parties to the Convention committed themselves to the full execution of judgments.Realising the Convention’s vision is a task shared between the Court, the Council of Europe, and theMember States, the Court cannot be, nor should it be, an enforcement mechanism. It is increasinglyimportant that the Court’s recognition of its appropriate role is matched by effective and robust domesticsystems of rights protection, including the prompt execution of judgments in full. This leads naturally tothe principle of subsidiarity.Subsidiarity and complementarityThe protection of access to justice under the Convention was identified in Golder as arising directly outof the shared adherence to the rule of law among the Member States. As the Convention preambleunderlines, the work of the Strasbourg Court is based upon a common heritage of political traditions,ideals, freedom and the rule of law, including the right of access to justice. But it is ultimately only throughthe domestic courts, with the Strasbourg Court as a safety net, that this and the other rights derived fromthe Convention can be made real and effective.The principle of subsidiarity recognises that the European Court of Human Rights should only entertainan application where the issue cannot be determined more effectively at the local level. In recent timesthis principle has gained greater prominence, with the Court repeatedly showing willingness to defer tonational courts’ assessments of their state’s compliance with the Convention. This reflects the Court’srole as a facilitator of the rule of law in Europe, respecting the varying views and different legal historiesof its Member States.33 See in particular [174].34 Joint Dissenting Opinion of Judges Yudkivska, Sajó, Bianku, Karakå, De Gaetano, Laffranque and Motoc at [1].35 See D.

This system is intended to foster a culture of rightsprotection at the national level subject to the safeguard provided by effective access to the European Courtof Human Rights.The obligation to exhaust domestic remedies requires an applicant to make normal use of the domesticremedies which are available and sufficient in respect of their Convention grievances. Applicants mustbe diligent in raising Convention complaints at the domestic level so that local courts have a meaningfulopportunity to resolve the human rights issues without recourse to Strasbourg.37 However, this rule issubject to two qualifiers: first, the applicant will only be required to exhaust domestic remedies which areavailable and effective “not only in theory but in practice”38 and secondly, the Court applies the exhaustionrule with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism.Obstacles arising out of the actual or possible costs of litigation may be relevant to the issue of whetheran applicant has exhausted all remedies which were “not only in theory but in practice” available to her.This is not an issue of whether litigation costs are themselves Convention-compatible,39 rather it is anexample of a situation in which the difficulty in accessing domestic courts may make it more likely thatlitigants apply to Strasbourg without proper exhaustion of domestic remedies, which is undesirable bothfrom a domestic and supranational perspective.While still very much the exception, the Court, in its judgment in Shamoyan v Armenia, has shownitself receptive to the applicant’s argument that, in light of her difficult financial situation, the absenceboth of legal aid and of evidence that counsel may be willing to act pro bono, the Government’s argumentof non-exhaustion should be dismissed.40 This might be said to highlight the risk that practical as well asformal barriers to access to justice at the national level, whether or not they fall foul of art.6(1), increasethe likelihood that the principle of subsidiarity will be fundamentally undermined; leaving the StrasbourgCourt in the unattractive situation of having to act as a first instance court; deprived of the benefit of theusually detailed and careful consideration of the issues by the national court(s).This is not how the Convention should function. The principle site for the interpretation and applicationshould be domestic courts. In his recent speech at Middlesex University Judge Robert Spano, Presidentof Section II of the Court, expressed a similar view, stating that “it is the national forum which is theprimary arena for resolving Convention disputes not Strasbourg”.41 He argues persuasively that the Courthas developed over time, moving from the formulation of key principles and doctrines of European humanrights law, to a more recent shift which places the onus on national decision makers. National bodiesshould be empowered and incentivised to apply and enforce human rights norms in good faith withoutundue deference being accorded to states which fail to uphold human rights and the rule of law.The national court’s role as part of this subsidiary system was considered in another of Lord Reed’sjudgments in Osborn v Parole Board, where he held that:“The error in the approach adopted on behalf of the appellants … is to suppose that because an issuefalls within the ambit of a Convention guarantee, it follows that the legal analysis of the problem36 J-P.

Properly understood, Convention rights do notform a discrete body of domestic law derived from the judgments of the European court.”42He quoted Lord Justice-General Rodger, saying:“It would be wrong… to see the rights under the European Convention as somehow forming a whollyseparate stream in our law; in truth they soak through and permeate the areas of our law in whichthey apply.”43These important statements reflect both the cooperative nature of the Convention, with the principle ofsubsidiarity at its core, and the responsibility of the national courts to resolve Convention issues, whetherunder domestic law or by applying the principles developed by the Strasbourg Court. Thus understood,the Convention is a backdrop; a safety net that can catch cases which may not have been adequatelyresolved at domestic level. Domestic courts and national legal systems become the essential locus for theprotection and enforcement of human rights. This approach promotes effectiveness, increases respect forhuman rights and enhances the legitimacy of courts at all levels as none is obliged to intrude on the other’sarea of competence under the Convention.Effective access to justice at the domestic level is therefore an important factor in enabling the StrasbourgCourt to fulfil its proper role as a safety net in relation to the Convention rights. As the Court has repeatedlystressed, a thorough and detailed domestic debate of the human rights issues under consideration will begiven significant weight. This is not limited to the scrutiny afforded by domestic courts, it also encompassesnational legislatures.In Animal Defenders v United Kingdom, the Court recognised that the quality of the parliamentary andjudicial review of the necessity of the relevant measure was important to the assessment of proportionality,including the margin of appreciation.44 This year alone, the Grand Chamber of the Court has, on twooccasions, reaffirmed this approach. In Satakunnan v Finland the Grand Chamber considered that the“exacting and pertinent” review of the relevant legislation at a parliamentary and judicial level led toFinland being entitled to a wider margin of appreciation in deciding how to strike a fair balance betweenthe respective rights under arts 8 and 10 of the Convention in that case.45 Also, just this month the GrandChamber dealt with the issue again in the case of Garib v Netherlands, in which it held:“It falls to the Court to examine carefully the arguments taken into consideration during the legislativeprocess and leading to the choices that have been made by the legislature and to determine whethera fair balance has been struck between the competing interests of the State and those directly affectedby those legislative choices.”46Just as the European Court may consider the exhaustion requirement to be satisfied without an applicanthaving sought recourse before the domestic authorities where there is no effective and accessible remedyat the domestic level, so it is much more likely to show deference where the national consideration, in thecourts and, where relevant, in Parliament, is of a high quality.We can learn from these contrasting examples that the principle of subsidiarity is not a rigidly formalisticdivision between Strasbourg and nation states; rather it should create a meaningful dialogue which promotesand enhances rights protection and access to justice at all levels. It respects the views and attitudes ofMember States where these are clear, considered and not incompatible with effective rights protection.Judge Spano has referred to this as a “qualitative, democracy-enhancing approach”.47 This approach also42Osborn v Parole Board [2013] UKSC 61 at [63].43HM Advocate v Montgomery [2000] JC 111 at [117].44Animal Defenders v United Kingdom (2013) 57 E.H.R.R. 21.45 Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v Finland (App. No.931/13), judgment of 27 June 2017 at [192]-[196].46Garib v Netherlands (App. No.43494/09), judgment of 6 November 2017 at [138].47R.

TheCourt was founded on the democratic and rule of law heritage of the nations over which it has jurisdictionand seeks to assist them in protecting such norms. National authorities are recognised as being best placedto interpret and apply the law compatibly with the fundamental principle of access to justice, but wherenecessary the core universal principle, the effective right of access to court across Europe, is ultimatelyprotected and promoted by the European Court.Democracy and the rule of lawIt is of the utmost importance that courts of all levels observe and uphold the principle of meaningfulaccess to justice. This is part of the courts’ function as guardians of the rule of law in the context of asystem based on representative democracy. This essential democratic function was, of course, expresslyrecognised in the Court’s case-law as long ago as Golder v United Kingdom. When identifying a right ofaccess to the courts as an inherent part of art.6(1), the Court based its reasoning partly upon the dangerof arbitrary power and lawlessness which would result in the absence of an effective civil justice system.This approach is mirrored in the common law. As Lord Reed said in theUNISON case “without [accessto the courts], laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be renderednugatory, and the democratic election of Members of Parliament may become a meaningless charade”.48Power, without enforceable legal remedies, is likely to lead to anarchy and is incompatible with theexistence of a modern representative democracy. The proper functioning of a representative democracy,including its inherent obligation to protect the political rights of those not currently represented by themajority as well as their fundamental rights and their right and opportunity to become the next majorityby democratic means,49 has guided both the Supreme Court and Strasbourg in addressing barriers to accessto justice.The drafters of the Convention recognised that democracy cannot exist without the rule of law. This iswhy the Court has continually invoked the rule of law and the Convention’s democratic underpinningswhen concluding that the rights under art.6(1) must be practical and effective. In Bertuzzi v France theCourt emphasised that this is particularly true in the case of the right of access to the courts “in view ofthe prominent place held in a democratic society by the right to a fair trial”.50 Similarly, in Kreuz v Poland,the Court held that “in civil matters one can scarcely conceive of the rule of law without there being apossibility of having access to the Courts”.51 The Court’s reasoning, like that of courts in the UK, aims toprotect and foster the rule of law and democracy.Viewed through the historic and more recent experience of the Strasbourg Court, there is little doubtthat arbitrary power threatens a society which does not uphold the right of access to justice in two ways.Firstly, there is an absence of meaningful public law constraints on government decision-making.Withouteffective and independent judicial oversight, the executive will, by mistake or design, make unlawfuldecisions which go unchallenged. This has obvious repercussions for the protection of human rights andcivil liberties but also has a less immediate, indirect effect upon public confidence in the government.Judicial review is a safeguard against the misuse of power which loses all value if inaccessible to thoseaffected by governmental decision-making. Without access to the administrative courts, people’s loss of48UNISON [2017] UKSC 51 at [68].49 See A.

This in turn undermines the credibility of the democratic system as a whole.Secondly, in a state which does not respect access to justice arbitrary power is rarely limited to theexecutive and affects relations between private individuals. Employers can unfairly dismiss employeeswithout fear of reprisal, businesses can exploit consumers and competitors, professionals’ negligence goesunpunished. The fabric of rights and obligations which weaves society together loses its integrity in theabsence of an available and effective enforcement mechanism in the form of the legal system. Accessiblecivil remedies provide both redress and deterrence. Where there is access to justice, employers areincentivised to treat employees fairly, businesses are meaningfully regulated and professionals holdthemselves to a higher standard. In this way, society as a whole benefits from upholding access to justicein civil proceedings.The threat of arbitrary power to which Golder v United Kingdom referred remains relevant today. TheCourt, State Parties and the Council of Europe more generally are confronted with real threats to the ruleof law as a result of the rise of movements and even governments that challenge the principles which formthe basis of all genuine democracy as identified by the Statute of the Council of Europe and described aspart of our common heritage. If the Convention system is to rise to these challenges, it will requireleadership at all levels and a renewed commitment to fundamental rights and access to justice. It is of realconcern that some Member States of the Council of Europe and beyond appear to be resiling from thecommitments which they have made to respect the rule of law, including access to independent andimpartial courts, and democracy. All Member States, including the UK, have a role to play in reaffirmingthese principles and leading by example on access to justice and meaningful rights protection.A democracy is not a dictatorship of the majority. In their Joint Concurring Opinion in the recent caseof Dakir v Belgium—concerning the Belgian law prohibiting face covering in public—Judges Spano andKarakaş recalled that majoritarian interests, once embedded in legislation, can threaten fundamental rightsand exclude vulnerable minorities from access to justice. Courts at all levels have a duty to identify andreject such measures.52Human rights, inherently counter-majoritarian in nature, are a check on the arbitraryuse of power by the majority. Courts provide a unique reckoning mechanism which empowers wrongedindividuals, allowing them to seek redress against those persons and institutions which would otherwisebe more powerful than them. The judicial system and legal profession hold public and private power toaccount, thereby promoting the diversity and pluralism on which democracy is based. By facilitating andprotecting access to the courts, we strengthen democracy within and among nations.It is disappointing that, more than 40 years after Golder, there is still a need to call for the eliminationof barriers to access to justice. On the other hand, it is heartening that so many leading members of thelegal profession and the judiciary are drawing attention to the issue. The details of court fees and legalcosts are generally not headline-grabbing but require scrutiny from lawyers and judges alike. It is only byspeaking in unison under the common law and the Convention that our legal system, at a domestic andsupranational level, can achieve meaningful and effective access to justice for all.52Dakir v Belgium (App. No.4619/12), judgment of 11 July 2017, Joint Concurring Opinion at [9].32 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsSame-Sex Marriage, Consensus, Certainty andthe European Court of Human RightsFrances HamiltonSenior Lecturer in Law at Northumbria UniversityEuropean Court of Human Rights; Human rights; Margin of appreciation; Marriage; Right to marry;Same sex partnersAbstractThere remains no right to same-sex marriage before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court).Yet it seems likely that at some stage the Court will recognise same-sex marriage. Recent dicta stressesthe movement towards legal recognition across Member States. It is only a lack of consensus, leading toa wide Margin of Appreciation, which prevents the Court recognising same-sex marriage. This articleproposes that if the Court continues with this approach, they should at least outline in future judgmentshowmany domestic legislatures need to legislate in favour of same-sex marriage, before they will determinethat a consensus will exist. This is due to the constitutional, manifold legal and symbolic implications ofmarriage. It is essential for a same-sex couple to know when their marriage will be legally recognised.If done in a consistent manner, this would increase the legitimacy of the Court and has the major advantagesof transparency, certainty and predictability.1. IntroductionThere continues to be no right to same sex-marriage before the Court.1 Following Oliari v Italy, MemberStates are obliged to provide same-sex couples with some form of civil partnership or registered partnership.2This is a breakthrough for same-sex partners3 although in its judgment the Court concentrated upon thedifference between the lack of legal and protections in Italy and the “social reality of the applicants” whowere widely accepted.4 Fenwick and Hayward argue that the Court by doing this “sought to relate its scopeto circumstances arising locally, in Italy, and most likely to arise inWestern European States”.5 In addition,although civil partnership is increasingly seen as having an intrinsic value in itself6 this will also not satisfythose proponents of same-sex marriage who view marriage as the gold standard.7However, recognition of same-sex marriage by the Court at some stage now seems likely. Stress wasplaced by the Court in Oliari v Italy on the “movement towards legal recognition” and the “continuing1 Schalk v Austria (App. No.30141/04), judgment of 24 June 2010; Hämäläinen v Finland (App. No.37359/09), judgment of 16 July 2014; andChapin v France (App. No.40183/07), judgment of 9 June 2016.2Oliari v Italy (App. Nos 18766/11 and 36030/11), judgment of 31 July 2015.3G.

Today, 15 Member States recognise same-sex marriage.11 This accords with a “global movementto legalise same-sexmarriage”.12Reform is by nomeans complete, as certain Central and Eastern Europeanstates continue to ban same-sex marriage and constitutionally define marriage as between a man and awoman.13 Russia, a Council of Europe Member State, seems to be a long way away from consideringprotections for same-sex couples.14 A claim is now being brought to the Court from three same-sex couplesin Russia who are claiming a right to same-sex marriage.15 As Russia has no form of legal protection forsame-sex couples, the Court is considering the matter as a “claim for some means of formalising theirrelationship in Russia, via a form of registered partnership”.16 It remains to be seen whether the Court willconfine Oliari v Italy to countries where same-sex couples are socially accepted, which is very differentfrom the homophobia present in Russian society. What will be crucial in the Court’s analysis here is thelevel of consensus deemed to exist between Member States on this issue.It remains debateable whether the Court is following the correct approach in considering lack ofconsensus, leading to a wide MoA, as determinative in relation to same-sex marriage. Commentatorsargue that placing such emphasis on consensus ignores the interests of the minority group.17 They alsoargue that in cases that fall within the MoA doctrine due to there being no consensus, there is a lack oflegal analysis18 and no high level of scrutiny.19 Instead, the consensus standards results in a fact-dependent8See Oliari (App. Nos 18766/11 and 36030/11). E. Sutherland, “A Step Closer to Same-Sex Marriage Throughout Europe” (2011) 15 Edin. L. Rev.97, 98 states that “[e]ven on the Court’s reasoning, it is arguably only a matter of time (perhaps some time) until the right to marry becomes a realityfor same-sex couples throughout Europe”. Interestingly, the trend towards greater rights being given to same-sex couples is also reflected in theYogyakarta Principles Plus 10 adopted on 10 November 2017 and available at http://yogyakartaprinciples.org/ [Accessed 22 January 2018]. Theynote in the Preamble that there “have been significant developments in international human rights law and jurisprudence on issues relating to sexualorientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics…” and that discrimination on these grounds can be compounded by discriminationon other grounds including that of amongst a lengthy list “marital or family status …”. Although the Yogyakarta Principles Plus 10 contain nothingspecifically in relation to same-sex marriage, they do include an Additional State Obligation relating to Equality and Non-Discrimination (Principle2) which states that Contracting States should “[t]ake all appropriate steps to ensure that reasonable accommodation is provided, where needed, inorder to promote equality and eliminate discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics”.9 See Schalk (App. No.30141/04) at [57], Hämäläinen (App. No.37359/09) at [39] and Chapin v France (App. No.40183/07).10 See P.

Certainty isneeded. This is due to the constitutional, manifold legal and symbolic implications of marriage. It isessential for a couple to know when their marriage will be legally recognised.23 This is also stressed byinternational case-law24 and international human rights covenants.25 Marriage bestows many legal rights26and is often connected to citizenship.27The suggested approach will increase the legitimacy of the Court as it would link any new decision onmovement of consensus in relation to same-sex marriage back to a democratic mandate of the legislaturesof Member States. This is needed at a time when certain political factions are discussing leaving theCouncil of Europe.28 The proposed reform also has the major advantages of transparency, certainty andpredictability. The next section sets out the conundrum facing the Court in balancing the competingtensions of universalism and relativism in relation to same-sex marriage. Section 3 details a critique ofthe existing interpretation of consensus. Section 4 sets out case-law from the area of sexualitiesdemonstrating the lack of certainty over how consensus is determined. Finally, section 5 considers theproposed reform in more detail and considers the advantages this would bring.2. The compromise between universalism and relativismOne of the central challenges for the Court is to uphold the universal standard of human rights, whilstrespecting regional differences. Fenwick and Hayward explain that in the context of rights to legalrecognition of same-sex couples, there is much difficulty for the Court in “adjudicating in an increasinglynationalistic context”29 where Eastern European countries take a much more conservative approach in thisregard.30 Yet this approach by the Court attracts much criticism. Popplewell-Scevak argues that given theEuropean Convention on Human Rights (European Convention) Preamble’s promise to “protect andenforce human rights … it is perplexing to see the court refrain from legalising same-sex marriage …”.3120Y. Shany, “Toward a General Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in International Law” (2005) 16(5) Eur. J. of Inter. L. 907, 91221 For example, Member States could be relying on discredited arguments such as the slippery slope argument (that same-sex marriage would leadto polygamy for example) as well as the definitional argument (that “traditions change and dictionaries are not the law” and the procreation argument(that marriage is for procreative purposes only).22 F.

Indeed, the Court is well aware that the European Convention cannot be “frozen in time”.34Concepts such as “living instrument” allow the Court to operate “evolutive” and “dynamic” interpretativetechniques so that the European Convention can be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions ratherthan what the drafters thought back in the 1950s.35 Such techniques are used throughout the case-lawwhichwill be examined in the relevant area of sexualities and family law.36However, in an area as sensitive as same-sex marriage, the Court wishes to avoid any charge that it isengaging in “judicial politics”.37 Unlike the role of the Supreme Court in the US for instance, the Courthas to constantly adhere to the states’ MoA.38 There needs to be a compromise between the competinginterests at stake. The MoA alongside consensus (which the latter is one of the key factors in determiningthe width of theMoA) are the “primary tools”39 employed by the Court in its case-law on same-sexmarriagein ensuring it does not overstep the “primary responsibility”40 given under the European Convention toMember States to secure human rights.41 The doctrine of subsidiarity42 has been recently re-emphasised.43The role of the Court is in fact secondary. Its task is to “examine the domestic decision” and ensurecompatibility with the European Convention.44 This is all part of securing agreement and social cooperationin the face of moral pluralism,45 which is particularly important in an area such as same-sex marriage. Asset out above, it remains debateable whether the Court is following the correct approach in this regard.46However, as the Court currently determines that a lack of consensus is decisive in reaching a wide MoA,47this article argues that at least more clarity and guidance is needed as to when a consensus is deemed tohave been reached. As stated above, there are constitutional, manifold legal and symbolic implications ofmarriage.48 Couples are entitled to know when they will be able to enter into a same-sex marriage.32See Dzehtsiarou, “Does Consensus Matter? Legitimacy of European Consensus in the Case Law of the European Court of Human Rights” [2011]P.L. 534, 540. Dzehtsiarou at 540 also refers to Ronald Macdonald, “The Margin of Appreciation”, in Ronald Macdonald, Franz Matscher and HerbertPetzold (eds), The European System for the Protection of Human Rights (Martin Nijhoff Publishers, 1993), p.24 who argues that consensus wouldmean the European Court would “forfeit its aspirational role”. N. Shuibne, “Margins of Appreciation; National Values, Fundamental Rights and ECFree Movement Law” (2009) 34(2) Eur. L.

The consensus standard critiquedCommentators argue that consensus, in relation to many human rights, is often the most important factorin determining the width of the MoA given to a Member State.49 When considering same-sex marriage,it is clear that lack of consensus is the critical factor.50 The MoA varies greatly depending on what rightsare involved. 51 It can and frequently does evolve over time. Factors which are commonly cited indetermining the width of the MoA include the importance of the right, the Member State interest involvedand whether there is a consensus on an issue.52 Certain rights are given a narrow MoA.53 Equally, certainvulnerable groups, including gay people, are given extra protection.54 Where discrimination concerns gaypeople, for example, the Member State will need to have “very weighty reasons for the restriction inquestion”.55 Logically, now that same-sex couples fall under the definition of family under art.8,56 the“very weighty reasons” test should lead to a breach of art.12 (right to marriage) being found in relationto same-sex couples bar from marriage. Such was the view of the minority judges in Schalk v Austria.57It is only because the Court determines there to be a wide MoA (due to a lack of consensus) in relation tomarriage under art.12 which prevents the Court moving forward in this area.58Many of the criticisms surrounding MoA and its key factor of consensus centre around the fact that itis very difficult to understand how it works and that it is lacking in predictability.59 Some commentatorseven argue that it is not “consistent with the rule of law”.60 There is no certainty as to when the Court willdetermine that sufficient consensus has been reached to recognise same-sexmarriage. Bribosia et al. rejectthe consensus argument on the basis that it is “fraught with methodological imprecision”.61 Confusionreigns with regards to the terminology used, and multiple terms are used including “common Europeanstandard”, “common European approach”, “emerging consensus” or “trend”.62 The Court also demonstratesno consistency in determining what sources are appropriate for establishing a consensus.63 For example,on occasion emphasis has been placed on scientific reports, and this emphasis is later disregarded in similar49E.g.

This will increase the legitimacy of the Court, as it willlink the Court’s decision back to the democratic mandate of the Member States’ legislatures. If appliedin such a manner, the doctrine of consensus could be an important legitimising tool. This could give theCourt’s judgments in this area extra weight, which is useful at a time when certain political factions arediscussing leaving the Council of Europe.68 The next section examines the lack of certainty resulting fromhow the Court has applied the doctrine of consensus in its developing line of case-law concerningsexualities.4. Case-law demonstrating the lack of certainty over how consensus is determinedIn the area of family law and sexualities, the Court has employed a dynamic interpretative technique. TheCourt has not been insistent on demonstrating consensus in order to move case-law forwards. Indeed, ithas been prepared to depart from previous precedents in the areas of decriminalisation of same-sex sexualactivity,69 equalisation of the age of consent for same-sex couples,70 same-sex couples’ tenancy rights,71employment of gay people in the military,72 definition of family concerning gay people,73 gay persons’right to adopt74 and most recently same-sex couples’ rights to form civil partnerships,75 all withoutdemonstrating a consistent method as to how consensus is determined. All of this case-law has meant aprogressive approach to the development of gay rights and has to be applauded as such. Fenwick andHayward also argue that a further move towards an increasing consensus in relation to legal recognitionof same-sex couples rights can be done by removing “asymmetry of access” to protected legal partnerships.76They explain asymmetry of access to arise when same-sex and opposite-sex couples are given differentlegal statuses. Erasing asymmetry of access in the context ofWestern European countries this would meanremoving inequalities where same-sex couples can only access registered partnerships and not marriage.77Such a course of action together with an increasing number of Eastern European countries introducing64Look at adoption cases Frette v France (2002) 38 E.H.R.R. 438 which placed emphasis on the division in the scientific community about theeffect which individual gay adoption would have on the child.

In turn this would make the position of EasternEuropean countries which afford same-sex couples no legal protections as being seen to be “starklyanomalous”.78 However, there would still remain doubt as to when the Court would deem there to be asufficient level of consensus to recognise a right to same-sex marriage. There is an underlying problemin that the Court has shown no consistent application as to determine when consensus exists. The Courtis insistent on consensus being the decisive factor here,79 but its case-law leaves no clues as to when thiswill be determined to exist. Key cases are now examined in more detail.The first in this important line of cases isDudgeon v United Kingdom, which concerned criminalisationof sodomy in Northern Ireland. This was subsequently found to contravene art.8 (right to respect forprivate life) and has been lauded as “open[ing] the door for LGBTQI rights to be include under the[European] Convention”.80 A flaw in the judgment, for those seeking to understand when the Court willadvance the case for same-sex marriage, is that the Court never thoroughly explained its departure fromprevious case-law. The reversal of precedent was done on the basis of a “better understanding, and inconsequence an increased tolerance, of homosexual behaviour in the great majority of Member States”.81Little guidance was given as to what was meant about a “better understanding”.82 The Court did considerother domestic laws83 but never thoroughly documented howmany otherMember States’ legislatures wererequired to have introduced legislation. Letsas criticises this as instance of the Court making a “moral”decision, rather than determining “some commonly accepted standards”.84 Confusing terminology suchas “better understanding” does little to develop our understanding of when a sufficient consensus will bereached in relation to same-sex marriage.Brauch also considers that case-law demonstrates that the Court utilises the concept of MoA, with itskey factor of consensus, in a manner which results in the standard sometimes changing without warning.85The case he discusses concerned gay peoples’ employment in the military.86 Previously national securitydefences put forward by Member States were given a wide MoA.87 In Smith v United Kingdom, the Courtdetermined (despite the argument to the contrary by the UK government)88 that no defence could be upheldon the basis of national security. This was because “particularly serious reasons” had to exist in relationto restrictions which concerned the “most intimate part of an individuals’ private life”.89 Ultimately, theUK were not successful in their defence which the Court interpreted as “founded solely upon the negativeattitudes of heterosexual personnel towards those of homosexual orientation”.90 Despite national securitydefences previously being given a wide MoA,91 suddenly no MoA was given to the UK. Again, althoughadvancing LGBT rights, the sudden shift in position by the Court was unpredictable. The UK had prepared78Fenwick and Hayward, “Rejecting Asymmetry of Access to Formal Relationship Statuses for Same and Different-Sex Couples at Strasbourg andDomestically” [2017] E.H.R.L.R. 544, 563 define asymmetry of access to mean where different sex couples have “two options: cohabitation or marriage,while same-sex couples are confined to cohabitation only. But a form of asymmetry also arises in states which have introduced registered partnershipsfor same-sex couples, leaving availability of marriage only to different-sex couples”.79 Schalk (App. No.30141/04); Oliari (App. Nos 18766/11 and 36030/11); and Chapin (App. No.40183/07).80 Popplewell-Scezak, “The European Court of Human Rights and Same-Sex Marriage: The Consensus Approach” (2016), p.9.81Dudgeon (1982) 4 E.H.R.R. 149 at [60].82Dudgeon (1982) 4 E.H.R.R. 149 at [60].83Dudgeon (1982) 4 E.H.R.R. 149 at [60].84Letsas, “Strasbourg’s Interpretative Ethic: Lessons for the International Lawyer” (2010) 21(3) E.J.I.L. 509, 531.85Brauch, “The Margin of Appreciation and the Jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights: Threat to the Rule of Law” (2004–2005)11 Columbia J. of Eur.

Although third party interveners brought upinternational examples of equal treatment of unmarried same-sex and opposite-sex couples,95 these werenot considered in the Court’s judgment. Instead, the Court introduced a new dicta that “weighty reasons”were needed in justifying differences in treatment between opposite-sex and same-sex partners.96 Whilstthe case was obviously an advance for LGBT rights by making any Member States’ discriminatory lawagainst gay people subject to a heightened test, it did not address the issue concerning consensus. It offersno clues to be able to predict when a consensus will be deemed to exist in relation to same-sex marriage.Another change from previous case-law occurred in the recognition of same-sex relationships underthe “family” aspect of art.8. The Court had a long entrenched approach97 to not recognising same-sexrelationships under the family aspect of art.8.98 Instead, such relationships were always considered underthe private life aspect.99 It was not until Schalk v Austria (2010) that same-sex couples were recognisedas having family rights.100 This has been described as “remarkable”101 progress. The Court justified itsextension of case-law on the basis of the “rapid evolution of social attitudes towards same-sex couples”.102Again, although this case illustrates the dynamic interpretative techniques of the Court, there was noexplanation as to how the Court gauged the change in social attitudes. There was consideration of thelegislative status of same-sex couples internationally, but the Court stated this was insufficient to amountto a European consensus in relation to same-sex marriage.103 Yet despite the lack of consensus in relationto same-sex marriage, the Court did transform previous case-law to recognise same-sex couples havinga right to family life under art.8. This approach of the Court is confusing. A “rapid evolution of socialattitudes” cannot be the same as consensus, as no consensus was determined to exist in relation to theright to marry.104 It appears from Schalk v Austria (2010) that consensus is not needed for art.8 (right to aprivate and family life), but is required for art.12 (right to marry.) Yet again, however, there is no clue asto when consensus will be reached for the purpose of art.12. This article sets out a suggestion that theCourt should clarify in future judgments when consensus will be deemed to have been reached.The lack of clarity as to the weight given to consensus arguments in this area is further revealed by themost recent line of cases before the Court concerning civil partnership. In Vallianatos v Greece consensusplayed an important role in determining that there was a breach of art.14, taken in conjunction with art.8.105Where Greece had reserved civil partnership rights to opposite-sex couples only, an “evolving” or“minority” consensus106 was deemed important as only two states which had introduced such statuses hadreserved them specifically to opposite-sex couples. Confusingly this “minority” consensus was seen as92Karner v Austria (2003) 38 E.H.R.R. 528.93 Simpson v United Kingdom (App. No.11716/85).94Karner (2003) 38 E.H.R.R. 528.95Karner (2003) 38 E.H.R.R. 528 at [36].

This judgment shows that in some cases the Court looks at consensuswithin a selected group of Member States, rather than consensus across all Member States.InOliari v Italy (2015) consensus played an important role.107 The Court performed an extensive surveyof comparative law and found that for the first time a “thin majority” of states recognised a right to somelevel of civil partnership.108 This was an important reason for the Court’s decision that art.8 had beenbreached. Yet in other cases the Court has taken no regard of consensus. In the recent case of Ratzenbockv Austria,109 which concerned an opposite-sex couple wishing to enter into a civil partnership, on thegrounds that this was a lighter form of recognition, the Court did not consider consensus at all. Instead,the majority of the Court considered that different-sex couples were not in a comparable situation to thatof same-sex couples. This was because the “institutions of marriage and … registered partnership [were]essentially complementary in Austrian law”.110 As no comparator was found the Court did not go on to“assess the difference of treatment or the justification for the difference”.111 This seems at odds withprevious decisions made in Schalk v Austria and Vallianatos v Greece where a comparison was madebetween same and opposite-sex couples and their access to legal statuses.112 It also meant that the Courtnever considered a consensus analysis at all, despite this being seen as decisive in Oliari v Italy.113Interestingly, Fenwick and Hayward argue that a consensus could be found in this area, depending onhow the question is framed.114 If the Court had asked if following the introduction of same-sex partnerships,the majority of Member States had confined them to same-sex partners the answer would have been inthe affirmative. However, if the Court had asked instead whether the majority of states followingintroduction of same-sex partnerships had “maintained asymmetry of access” the answer would have beenin the negative, as most Member States following the introduction of registered partnerships had gone onto introduce same-sex marriage.115 Austria is one of the few countries to have maintained registeredpartnerships for same-sex couples and marriage for opposite-sex couples. This further serves to highlightthe confusing treatment of consensus by the Court.In a similar manner to the transformation of the legal treatment of gay people before the Court, thetreatment of transgender persons by the Court has also undergone a major change.116 Early case-law resultedin a denial of transpersons’ rights and a wide MoA, deemed necessary due to a lack of consensus.117 Yet16 years later transpersons’ rights were recognised, including the right to marry in their new sex.118 TheCourt made a clear commitment to a “dynamic and evolutive approach” in order to “render [the EuropeanConvention’s] rights practical and effective, not theoretical and illusory”.119 However, when reviewingthe case-law before the Court, no clear explanation was given as to how the Court justified this change in107Oliari (App. Nos. 18766/11 and 36030/11).108Oliari (App. Nos. 18766/11 and 36030/11).109Ratzenbock v Austria (App. No.28475/12), judgment of 26 October 2017.110Ratzenbock (App. No.28475/12) at [40].111H.

The first in the line of case-law did not deem it appropriate to consider the domestic law inMember States120 and merely stated that the matter be kept “under review”.121 Further case-law did at leasttake note of international comparisons and established this as a valid methodology towards consensusbuilding.122 Eventually, 16 years later, the Court was swayed by an “emerging consensus”123 and referencewas also made to a “continuing international trend”.124 The variety of terminology used leads to confusion.125On the facts as well, over the 16-year period examined, there had been very little progress in the numberof European countries recognising transpersons’ rights.126 To add to the confusion, the Court also examinedstates outside of Europe, including Australia and New Zealand. Brauch concludes that there are no legalstandards to be found in such decisions, arguing that the Court was not “engaged in legal analysis, but inpolicy making”.127 It creates difficulties for those wishing to determine when a consensus will be determinedto have been reached in relation to same-sex marriage. This leads to a lack of clarity and predictability asto when the Court will introduce same-sexmarriage. The Court frequently reverses previous cases. Relianceis made upon a consensus standard that is not thoroughly explained. Change is needed here. If the Courtdetermines that a matter falls within the MoA due to a lack of consensus, as is the case for same-sexmarriage, Member States should be able to predict when a sufficient consensus will be deemed to havebeen reached.5. Proposed reform and the advantages this would bringThis article suggests that if the Court continues to stress the need for consensus in future judgmentsregarding same-sex marriage, it should at least outline how many domestic legislatures need to legislatein favour of same-sex marriage, before it will determine that a consensus exists. This will increase thelegitimacy of the Court and also has major advantages of transparency, certainty and predictability.Legitimacy is a particularly important at present with certain political factions threatening to leave theCouncil of Europe.128 The “legitimacy of international law is usually attributed to the States’ [original]consent”.129 This argument surely holds less weight 50 years after the originally signatures.130 The questioncan also be raised as to how true the original consent argument holds in the face of the fact of the extensiveinterpretative techniques used by the Court. As demonstrated above, the case-law concerning sexualitieshas evolved rapidly over the course of the last few years.131 A challenge is therefore faced in Central andEuropean states (whose people largely have a more conservative approach to these matters)132 to ensureenforcement of any judgment in this area.120Rees (1987) 9 E.H.R.R. 56 at [42].121Rees (1987) 9 E.H.R.R. 56 at [47].122Cossey v United Kingdom (1991) 13 E.H.R.R. 622.123Goodwin (1996) 22 E.H.R.R. 123 at [84].

Examples of Member States failing to enforce decisions of theCourt are easy to find.136 Consensus remains an important argument and is “a vital force in judicial policythat the European Court uses when it fears that going against consensus will render its rulings ineffectual”.137Several judges in the Court have also opined that they believe there is a link between consensus andenforcement and acceptance of judgments.138 As an international court, the Court is never going to havea democratic mandate. However, if consensus can be linked back to the democratic legislatures of MemberStates, this will increase the legitimacy of the Court’s role. The proposed reform also has the majoradvantages of increasing legitimacy, transparency, certainty and predictability. The Court would beoperating within the rule of law and not trespassing into a political role.6. ConclusionIn recent years there has been a transformation in the treatment of LGBT rights. The Court now requiresMember States to offer some form of legal protection to same-sex couples Europe-wide (although thiscould be confined to countries where same-sex couples are accepted socially),139 but there continues to beno right to same-sex marriage.140 This is because of the lack of consensus among Member States on theissue.141 There remains a divide between the largely liberalWestern states and the more conservative statesof Central and Eastern Europe.142 It seems likely, however, that at some stage the Court will determinethat there is a right to same-sex marriage.143 The difficulty remains that currently proponents of same-sexmarriage are left with little to guide them as to when the Court will determine this moment has arrived.Certainty is needed. This is due to the constitutional, manifold legal and symbolic implications of marriage.It is essential for a couple to know if they can legally marry.144The issue of same-sex marriage recognition across Europe illustrates the difficult balance, which theCourt has to make, between upholding the universal standard of human rights, whilst respecting regionaldifferences. In relation to same-sex marriage, it remains debateable as to whether the Court is followingthe correct approach in considering lack of consensus, leading to a wideMoA, as determinative in relation133 See Wintemute, “Consensus is the right approach for the European Court of Human Rights” (12 August 2010), The Guardian.134Dzehtsiarou, “Does Consensus Matter?

Critics argue that this ignores minorities145 and results in a lack of legal analysis146and no high level of scrutiny.147 However, in politically sensitive areas such as same-sex marriage, theCourt wishes to avoid any charge that it is engaging in “judicial politics”.148 A wide MoA, due to theemphasis on lack of consensus ensures that the Court does not overstep the “primary responsibility”149given under the European Convention to Member States to secure human rights.150 Despite the emphasison consensus it is far from clear how the Court determines whether a consensus exists.151 There are alsoconfusions in relation to the terminology used around consensus, where numerous versions of the nameare used.152 Again, no consistency is demonstrated in determining what sources are appropriate forestablishing a consensus.153 Analysis of case-law relating to sexualities and family law reveals very littleto aid our understanding. Despite advancing human rights protections for gay people and same-sex couples,case-law demonstrates a very inconsistent and confusing approach to the use of consensus.154 Even worse,it results in the charge that the Court is not acting in accordance with the rule of law.155This article sets out a novel approach by suggesting that if the Court continues to stress the need forconsensus in future judgments regarding same-sex marriage, it should at least outline howmany domesticlegislatures need to legislate in favour of same-sex marriage, before it will determine that a consensusexists. This will increase the legitimacy of the Court as it would link any new decision on movement ofconsensus in relation to same-sex marriage back to a democratic mandate of the legislatures of theMemberStates concerned. This is needed at a time when certain political factions are discussing leaving the Councilof Europe.156 Case-law concerning sexualities has evolved rapidly over the last few years.157 A challengeis therefore faced in Central and European states (whose people largely have a more conservative approachto these matters)158 to ensure enforcement of any judgment in this area. The Court also faces “a substantialstructural handicap”159 in getting its decisions enforced, as this depends upon the actions of MemberStates.160 Forcing minority views on countries which would otherwise be opposed could also result in a145 See Fenwick, “Same Sex Unions and the Strasbourg Court in a Divided Europe: Driving Forward Reform or Protecting the Court”s AuthorityVia Consensus Analysis” [2016] E.H.R.L.R. 248, 270; Dzehtsiarou, “Does Consensus Matter?

Consensuscould therefore, if applied in the suggested more consistent manner, aid the legitimacy of judgments.

In what follows we review the Court’s evolving role from issuing only declaratory judgmentsto exceptionally indicating individual and general remedial measures for the purpose of assisting in theimplementation of its judgments.I. IntroductionFor the first 40 years of its existence, the European Court of Human Rights (the Court), in cases where aviolation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was found, limited itself to the issuingof declaratory judgments, being primarily concerned with whether it was necessary to order awards ofmonetary just satisfaction to applicants. The Court did not seem to be confident that it had the power tomake recommendations to respondent states regarding the steps to be taken to remedy the consequencesof the violation of the ECHR. Similarly, it had habitually abstained frommaking any consequential ordersor statements, holding that it falls to the Committee of Ministers (CoM) to supervise the execution of itsjudgments.Increasingly though, over the last two decades, the Court’s role in the execution of its own judgmentshas becomemore proactive than under the traditional dualist view, according to which the Court’s judgmentsare declaratory and it is for the states to choose the means of implementing them within their domesticlegal order.1 It has been aptly noted that this development is reflected in the Court’s practice of makingreference to art.46 of the ECHR in its judgments,2 and setting out its reasoning under para.1 of that article1Airey v Ireland (1979) 2 E.H.R.R. 305 at [26], “it is not the Court’s function to indicate, let alone to dictate which measures should be taken”.2L.-A. Sicilianos, “The Role of the European Court of Human Rights in the Execution of its Own Judgments”, in A. Seibert-Fohr and M. Villiger(eds), Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights—Effects and Implementation (Germany: Ashgate-Nomos, 2014), pp.285–315.[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors46even where the judgments remain declaratory in principle.3 At the same time, in some cases, the Courtappears to be claiming a decisive role in the delivering of restitutio in integrum to the successful applicants.Under art.46 of the ECHR, “the High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the decision of theCourt in any case to which they are parties”. The Court may deliver declaratory judgments as to whethera certain action by state organs is in conflict with the provisions of the ECHR. In accordance with theprinciple of subsidiarity,4 the Member States enjoy a margin of appreciation in the implementation of theECHR and the judgments of the Court. Under art.41 the Court may, where restitutio in integrum is legallyand/or physically impossible, award compensation as “just satisfaction” to the successful applicant forpecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.Whereas in the large majority of its judgments, the Court’s jurisprudence follows the traditionalapproach, in certain categories of judgments it has moved in the direction of indicating non-monetaryremedial measures. The Court’s indication of non-monetary remedial measures to respondent states ineither the operative part of its judgments or in its reasoning has given rise to a debate regarding itscompetence to do so as well as the reasons for and circumstances in which this may be justifiable. In whatfollows we review the Court’s evolving role from issuing only declaratory judgments to exceptionallyindicating individual and general remedial measures for the purpose of assisting in the implementation ofits judgments.II. Execution of Court’s judgments: a three-fold obligationA Court’s judgment finding a violation of ECHR imposes three types of obligations on the respondentstate: to take the steps to put an end to the violation, to adopt general measures to end similar violationsand prevent future ones, and to make reparation to the affected parties for the violation5 in order to restoreto the extent possible the situation in place before the breach (“restitutio in integrum”). Implementationof the Court judgment is thus “a multifaceted task”,6 and the obligation of the state goes well beyond themere payment of damages.7The Court has considered that, whenever restitutio in integrum is impossible, either de jure or de facto,the respondent state can only offer partial reparation under art.46 and hence it is for the Court to affordthe applicant just reparation.8 When the Court has deemed it necessary to award just satisfaction, it is thestate’s duty to pay the applicants the relevant sums. “Just satisfaction” has, until recently, been the onlymeasure that the Court could order a state responsible for a violation of the ECHR to take, conferring onsuch a judgment the value of judgment ordering performance, in contrast to its classic declaratory judgment.9Under art.46 Member States are bound to adopt such individual measures in order to ensure that thesuccessful applicant is put, insofar as possible, in the same situation as prior to the violation of the ECHR.In addition, statesmay have to take general measures, such as the implementation of legislative amendments,in order to prevent further violations of a similar nature. The obligation of the states to adopt generalmeasures is also associated with art.46 of the ECHR and with the requirement not to repeat the violation.103E.

Restitutio in integrumA judgment finding a violation entails for the respondent state a legal obligation to put an end to the breachand to make reparation for its consequences, so as to restore as far as possible the situation existing priorto the violation, i.e. restitutio in integrum.12 Subject to monitoring by the CoM, the respondent state remainsfree to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under art.46 of the ECHR, providedthat such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court’s judgment.13Reparation, as ordered by the Court under art.41, is intended to place the applicant as close as possibleto the position in which he would have been had the violation of the ECHR not taken place.14 In thelandmark case of Papamichalopoulos v Greece, the Court held that:“a judgment in which the Court finds a breach of the Convention imposes on the respondent state alegal obligation to put an end to the breach and make reparation for its consequences in such a wayas to restore as far as possible the situation existing before the breach.”15Under art.41, restitutio in integrum is only required insofar as it is possible under the municipal law ofthe respondent state.16In its judgment in Guiso-Galliani v Italy,17 the Grand Chamber reiterated its position on art.41:“If the nature of the violation allows for restitutio in integrum it is the duty of the State held liableto effect it, the Court having neither the power nor the practical possibility of doing so itself. If,however, national law does not allow—or allows only partial—reparation to be made for theconsequences of the breach, Article 41 empowers the Court to afford the injured party such satisfactionas appears to it to be appropriate.”18The Court, in the case of Papamichalopoulos v Greece, confirmed the principle of restitutio in integrumas “it enshrines the obligation on a State that is guilty of a violation to make reparations for the consequencesof the violation found”.19 Failure by the respondent state to execute a Court judgment will also engage thestate’s international responsibility,20 as a state is “under an obligation to make restitution … provided thatrestitution is not ‘materially impossible’” and “does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefitderiving from restitution instead of compensation”.21Despite the internationally well-established jurisprudence regarding reparation often referred to by theCourt in its judgments, its traditional approach remained “essentially declaratory”,22 evincing a lack of11L.

Declaratory judgmentsNormally, the judgments of international courts, including the Court, do not have a direct effect withinthe domestic legal order. They only bind the respondent states, which have the obligation to fulfil andrespond to the different orders set out in the operative part of the judgment.29In Marckx v Belgium, the Court stated that its “judgment is essentially declaratory and leaves to thestate the choice of the means to be utilised in its domestic legal system for performance of its obligationsunder art.46(1) [then 53] and cannot of itself annul or repeal inconsistent national law or judgments”.30The Court has, over the years, reiterated this position31 and has refrained from either offering a generalapproach or from spelling out the measures to be adopted for implementation of its judgments by theMember States. Thus in Dickson v United Kingdom, the Court refused the applicant’s request to directthe government to take a specific action, noting that “the Court’s function is, in principle, to rule on thecompatibility with the Convention of the existing measures and it does not consider it appropriate in thepresent case to issue the requested direction”.32A judgment by the Court finding a violation of the ECHR is essentially declaratory in character, notprescriptive,33 amounting to the determination of an internationally wrongful act.34 The Court determineswhether the conduct of state authorities by action or omission, in a concrete case, was in conformity with23 See Leach, “No Longer Offering Fine Mantras to a Parched Child?

Accordingly, where an applicant succeeds in establishing violation of the ECHR, the Court’spractice has traditionally been to issue a declaration that the ECHR has been violated.35 The judgments ofthe Court, as opposed to the judgments of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights,36were not supposedto have direct effect on domestic law and national authorities unless the domestic law itself requires or atleast permits national authorities to apply or execute them.37Consequently a Court’s judgment does not in itself have the effect of quashing a decision38 of thenational authorities or abrogating national legislation found to be at variance with the requirements of theECHR. As the Strasbourg Court itself has repeatedly held, it has no competence to annul, repeal or modifystatutory provisions or individual decisions taken by administrative, judicial, or other national authorities.39It is up to the national organs of theMember States to draw the necessary conclusions from such a decisionand Member States “have a wide discretion in the choice of the means to be used”40 in implementing theCourt’s judgments.V. Indications of individual and general measuresThe Court did not, as mentioned above, consider itself competent to make recommendations as to whichsteps should be taken to remedy the consequences of the ECHR violation41 and had habitually abstainedfrom making any consequential orders or statements, holding that it falls to the CoM to supervise theexecution of its judgments.42 Hence the Court would refrain, as a matter of principle, from instructing howa Member State should conform its domestic legislation to the ECHR, leaving it to the state’s discretionas to the consequences of relatively vaguely defined norms of conduct.43In the past, successful applicants have asked the Court to direct the respondent state to introducenecessary legislative amendments so as to bring into conformity with the ECHR national law found tohave been at the source of a violation.44 Each time the Court categorically replied that the ECHR did notempower it to order the responded state to alter its legislation.45 In Soering v United Kingdom, the applicantsubmitted that “just satisfaction of his claims would be achieved by effective enforcement of the Court’sruling” inviting the Court to give directions to the states concerned. The Court declined as: “By virtue ofArticle 54 [now Article 46], the responsibility for supervising execution of the Court’s judgments restswith the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe”.46More recently in the case of Khodorkovskiy v Russia,47 the Court, rejecting the applicant’s request forspecific measures to prevent similar future violations, reiterated that its judgments are declaratory in natureand that the indication of specific measures remains the exception to the rule.35 P. Leach, “Beyond the Bug River—A New Dawn for Redress Before the European Court of Human Rights” [2005] E.H.R.L.R. 148, 150.36Article 68(2) of the American Convention on Human Rights confers immediate legal effect upon the judgments of the Court in domestic law.37See Polakiewicz, “The Execution of Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights”, in R.

Following the entry intoforce of Protocol No.1153 and the establishment of the “new Court”, the “division of work”54 between theCourt and the CoM has been changing; at the same time the enlargement of the Council of Europe (CoE)brought to light deep-seated structural problems55which could not be adequately addressed in the traditionaldeclaratory manner.An early indication of the Court’s changing practice is evidenced in its judgment in Iatridis v Greece,concerning the withdrawal of a cinema licence, where the Court indicated that the best course of actionwould be to give the applicant a new cinema licence.56 But it was in the case of Papamichalopoulos vGreece57 (before the entry into force of Protocol No.11), that the Court, for the first time offered the statean alternative: either to make restitutio in integrum or to pay compensation for pecuniary damage withinsix months. Though the Court was deciding on claims of just satisfaction, this has been interpreted asconstituting the “first serious assault on the doctrine that [the Court] has no power to issue directions tothe states in respect of the execution of its judgments”.58Subsequently, the Court has held in a number of property cases59 that the respondent state was to returnto the applicant, within a period from three to six months, the property concerned.60 However, it almostalways left open an alternative for the state in directing that, failing restitution, a fixed sum in respect ofpecuniary damage61 was to be paid to the applicant by way of just satisfaction.1.

Contrary to the traditional view, it canthus be said that the Court can and does facilitate the execution process.The Court has made indications of general measures in judgments other than pilot ones,67 thus implying68that it considers its role in the execution of its judgments not to be restricted to cases with structural issues.It has indicated general measures in a variety of cases concerning violations of different ECHR rights,setting out its views in language that ranges from merely recommendatory to mandatory and prescriptive.Thus, in some judgments the Court “invites” the respondent state to take all necessary measures,69“recommends that the respondent state envisage taking the necessary measures,”70 or “expresses the view”that general measures should include amendments to domestic law.71 In other judgments the Court givesstronger indications for the adoption of certain general measures in the execution of its judgments suchas legislative and administrative reforms72 and yet in others it indicates “the very essence of the executionmeasures”,73 allowing a narrower margin of appreciation74 than when its recommendations are cast ingeneral terms.In some judgments75 the Court uses prescriptive language in the reasoning, to the effect that therespondent state “must take” the necessary measures, which allows for greater discretion in implementationby the respondent state. Whereas in a number of judgments respecting the introduction of an effectiveremedy for violations of the art.6(1) guarantee on length of proceedings,76 and art.1 Protocol No.1,77 theright to property, the Court has included the prescriptive direction in the operative part of the judgment78giving rise to a pressing need (if not quite a legal obligation) on the part of the offending state to complywith the Court’s direction.63The pilot judgment procedure was put in place following the adoption of CoM, Resolution Res(2004)3 on judgments revealing an underlyingsystemic problem (adopted by the CoM on 12 May 2004, at its 114th Session).64 See, e.g. Broniowski v Poland (2004) 43 E.H.R.R. 1.65 See, e.g. C.

Individual measuresIn contrast to general measures, indications for individual measures by definition must narrow the marginof appreciation available to the respondent state. In numerous cases against Turkey79 (in which the applicanthad been convicted by a security court, in violation of art.6 of the ECHR),80 the Court has indicated whatthe respondent state must do in order to comply with the judgment. In Alfatli v Turkey, it included in itsreasoning under art.41, “in principle, the most appropriate form of relief would be to ensure the applicantin due course a retrial by an independent and impartial tribunal”.81 In its judgment in Öçalan v Turkey,the Grand Chamber, in its reasoning under art.46, endorsed the case-law of the Chambers in these judgmentsagainst Turkey and reiterated that “a retrial or a reopening of the case, if requested, represents in principlean appropriate way of redressing the violation”.82 The Court has indicated such measures to remedyprocedural defects pointing out, in the reasons, that the reopening of proceedings83 is in principle the onlyremedy available.In some cases the Court goes beyond a recommendation and actually orders (in the operative part) thereopening of proceedings where it is possible under domestic law and civil procedure.84 Similarly, indicationsof individual measures relating to violations of the right to property are more coercive85 when included inthe operative part of the judgment.86 Finally, in some judgments the Court has indicated both individualand general measures, the first to provide a remedy for the applicant and the latter to prevent similarviolations in the future.87More precise indications were first given in Assanidze v Georgia where the Grand Chamber ordered,for the first time, an applicant’s release at the earliest possible date, in addition to the payment of justsatisfaction. The Court held that by its very nature, the violation found (continued deprivation of libertydespite the existence of a court order for release) did not leave any real choice as to the measures requiredto remedy it, in contrast to the usual discretion a state enjoys in these matters.88 In its release order theCourt refers clearly to art.46 of the ECHR.In Ilascu v Moldova and Russia, the Court ordered the release of arbitrarily detained applicants andheld that “any continuation of the unlawful and arbitrary detention of the three applicants would necessarilyentail a serious prolongation of the violation of Article 5 found by the Court and a breach of the respondentstates’ obligation under Article 46(1) of the Convention to abide by the Court’s judgment”.89 The Courtadded that “the respondent states are to take all necessary measures to put an end to the arbitrary detentionof the applicants still imprisoned and secure their immediate release”.90 It thus appears that the Court isempowered to give precise orders where the respondent state cannot reasonably claim any discretion inthe matter.91The orders for the release of the applicants in Assanidze and Ilascu, both included in the operative partof the respective judgment, were approvingly mentioned in the CoM’s first Annual Report.92 In this first79W.

Thus, in the case of Volkov v Ukraine, theCourt held in the operative part of its judgment, that the respondent state shall secure the applicant’sreinstatement in the post of judge of the Supreme Court at the earliest possible date.94 In the context of aviolation of the right to family life under art.8, the Court directed the respondent state to “secure effectivecontact between the applicant and his daughter at a time which is compatible with the applicant’s workschedule and on suitable premises…”.95 In the case of Youth Initiative for Human Rights v Serbia (violationof art.10) the Court issued a specific direction inclusive of a deadline, to the respondent state, to “ensurewithin three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final … that the intelligence agencyof Serbia provide the applicant with the information requested”.96The issue of the competence of the Court to make recommendations to respondent states for the adoptionof either general or specific remedial measures, that go beyond the classic monetary award for “justsatisfaction”, upon the finding of a violation of the ECHR, became the subject of dissenting opinions inthe case of Ferreira (No.2) v Portugal.97 The applicant had made a second application to the Court, relyingon art.46 (as well as alleging new violation of art.6(1)) following a refusal by the Portuguese SupremeCourt to order reopening of criminal proceedings as recommended in an earlier Chamber judgment98following a finding of a violation of art.6(1).The majority of the Grand Chamber dismissed the allegation under art.46 as outside the Court’scompetence and found no violation of art.6(1). In examining the issue of the reopening of proceedings,the Court states that “it does not have jurisdiction to order the reopening of proceedings” which of courseis not accurate,99 as is pointed out in one of the dissenting opinions. The wide divergence of views asexpressed in the dissenting opinions regarding the Court’s competence to indicate individual remedialmeasures has created unnecessary confusion regarding the Court’s willingness, as clearly demonstratedin certain categories of judgments, to bemore directive in suggesting specific measures to remedy violationsof the Convention by respondent states.The judges in their dissenting opinions seem to adopt two extreme positions, with President Raimondiclaiming on the one hand that the Court is invested with no competence, of any kind, in the field of theexecution of judgments100 and Judge Pinto de Albuquerque asserting on the other that “judgments of theCourt are not merely declaratory”101 and “that obligations imposed in the operative part and those includedonly in the reasoning part of the judgment have the same legal force, in spite of the different formulationgiven to them”.10293Del Rio Prada v Spain (App. No.42750/09), judgment of 21 October 2013 at [133] et seq. and operative part, at [3].94Volkov v Ukraine (App. No.21722/11), judgment of 9 January 2013, operative part at [9]; see also Fatullayev v Azerbaizan (2010) 52 E.H.R.R.2, operative part at [6].95Gluhakovic v Croatia (App. No.21188/09), judgment of 12 April 2011 at [3].96 Youth Initiative for Human Rights v Serbia (App. No.48135/06), judgment of 25 June 2013, operative part at [4].97Ferreira (No.2) v Portugal (App. No.19867/12), judgment of 11 July 2017.98Ferreira v Portugal (App. No.19808/08), judgment of 5 July 2011.99E.g.

Concluding remarksQuestions regarding the legal basis for the Court’s increasingly proactive role have been raised andconsidered by academics and judges,103 in an ongoing debate. It is generally pointed out by those whoargue that the Court has the competence to indicate execution measures that a legal basis for such “judicialactivism” is found within the Convention, and in particular arts 46, 19 and 32.104 It is further pointed outthat the Court is not acting alone in pursuing a more active role in the implementation of its judgments.The CoM has on a number of occasions adopted resolutions105 and recommendations106 relating to theeffective implementation of judgments which clearly aim at enabling the Court’s involvement in theexecution process. In its latest report on the implementation of judgments of the Court,107 the PACECommittee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights refers approvingly to the more proactive role of the Courtin the implementation of its judgments and the “strengthened interaction” between the Court and the CoM.On the other hand, whilst nodding approvingly towards the Court’s more active role in the context ofpilot judgments, the Steering Committee for Human Rights (CCDH) in its 2015 report108 reiterates itsposition that the Court should restrict the practice of giving specific indications to the narrow category ofthose exceptional cases that “leave no real choice as to the measure(s), in particular individual ones,required to remedy it”.InKhodorkovskiy v Russia,109 the Court proceeds to outline these “exceptional cases”110 and to distinguishthem from the case at hand. A perusal of the different categories of “exceptional cases” demonstrateflexibility on the part of the Court to consider that the circumstances of a given case may require theindication of specific remedial measures. In such cases, the Court, which finds a violation of the ECHR,is undoubtedly the most suitable legal organ of the CoE to also prescribe the appropriate remedy.There appears to be a consensus amongst commentators, judicial and academic, that the indication ofspecific execution measures by the Court, in the areas where it has done so to date (property restitution,unlawful detention, unfair trial, pilot and quasi pilot judgments) provides a degree of clarity that bothfacilitates the task of the CoM in supervising execution, and respondent states in implementing thejudgment. As such, the directive approach is considered a positive development, whilst it is emphasisedthat the Court’s interventionism occurs only in exceptional cases and adherence to the principle of103 See, e.g. Lambert-Abdelgawad, “The Execution of the Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights: Towards a Non-Coercive andParticipatory Model of Accountability” (2009) 69(3) Heidelberg Journal of International Law 471, 475; Judge Malinverni’s Dissenting Opinion inVerein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v Switzerland (No.2) (App. No.32772/02), judgment of 30 June 2009.104Critics of the Court’s proactive role consider the indication of measures as “judicial activism” referred to in L.-A. Sicilianos, “The Role of theEuropean Court of Human Rights in the Execution of its own Judgments”, in A. Seibert-Fohr and M.

Similarly the role of the CoM in overseeing the execution of judgmentsremains paramount and the Court’s prescriptive approach complements, rather than substitutes, that role.111The issue of the execution of judgments has remained central to the debate regarding the reform of theCourt, highlighting the importance of introducing effective strategies towards better and more promptimplementation of judgments. A number of related issues have come to the foreground as a result of theCourt’s assumption of a more proactive role, as indicated in Concurring Opinions112 by judges of the Courtin the context of infringement of rights protected by art.6(1) of the Convention. These include the following:the operative provisions of the judgment are the only ones with binding effect and the Court should nothesitate from including specific directions, where appropriate, in that part of the judgment and not just inthe reasoning; the application of the principle of restitutio in integrum, in cases where that is possible,should be pursued by the Court; and that since the aim of reparation is to restore the victim of the violationto the status quo ante, money awards under art.41 are of a subsidiary nature; the fact that supervision ofthe execution of judgments under art.46(2) is the responsibility of the CoM does not entail that the Courtitself has no role in the matter and should not contribute to the fulfilment of this task by indicating, notonly the source of the violation, but the remedy as well.The Court has progressively abandoned the absolute adherence to the traditionalist stance regardingnon-involvement in the execution of its judgments. This is a welcome development, especially where thecircumstances of the case allow for indication of measures that provide restitutio in integrum to the wrongedapplicant. The question remains how far it is prepared to go in this direction in the face of possibleopposition regarding the invasion of state sovereignty113 and the alleged undermining of the doctrine ofsubsidiarity.114111 Liu v Russia (No.2) (App. No.29157/09), judgment of 26 July 2011 at [65].112Romanov v Russia (App. No.41461/02), judgment of 24 July 2008, Joint Concurring Opinion, judges Spielman andMalinveri; Ilatovskiy v Russia(App. No.6945/04), judgment of 9 July 2009, Joint Concurring Opinion of judges Spielman and Malinveri; Salduz v Turkey (App. No.36391/02),judgment of 27 November 2008, Joint Concurring Opinion Judges Rozakis, Spielman, Ziemele and Lazarova Trajkovska.113E.g. controversy over the issue of prisoner voting in the UK and negative response to the pilot judgment in Greens and MT v United Kingdom(App. Nos 60041/08 and 60054/08), judgment of 23 November 2010.114But see Leach, “No Longer Offering FineMantras to a Parched Child?

Moreover, this articleaddresses the issue of voter identification laws in light of the recent announcement that voters in a pilotstudy will be required to produce some form of identification before voting in the May 2018 English localelections. Bearing in mind the experiences of compulsory voter identification laws in other countries,most notably the US, and the requirements of art.3 of the First Protocol to the ECHR, this article arguesthat the British Government must not impose requirements that may risk disenfranchising a large proportionof the electorate.1. IntroductionIn September 2017 the British Government announced that a pilot scheme to combat electoral fraud wouldbe trialled in the May 2018 local elections in England which would require individuals in five areas topresent some form of identification before voting in polling stations.1 Whilst this requirement is nowfamiliar practice in Northern Ireland,2 voters in the rest of the UK have historically been able to cast theirvotes in person simply by confirming their name and address. Despite being routinely practised in manycountries throughout the world, placing a legal obligation upon members of the electorate to produceidentification before voting has often been criticised for dissuading voters as well as, more troublingly,disenfranchising poor, minority and elderly citizens due to the fact that procuring approved forms ofidentification can be costly and burdensome.3This article will discuss the recent UK proposals from a human rights perspective, primarily theEuropean Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which guarantees a number of rights essential to politicalparticipation, not least of all art.3 of the First Protocol to the Convention,4 but also other internationalsources when relevant.5 Should the pilot scheme be deemed a success and compulsory voter identification1Cabinet Office, “Voter ID Pilot to Launch in Local Elections”, Press Release (16 September 2017), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/voter-id-pilot-to-launch-in-local-elections [Accessed 22 January 2018].2 See the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland, www.eoni.org.uk/Home [Accessed 22 January 2018].3Although not addressed in this article, another criticism relates to the administration of vast quantities of personal data which raises concerns aboutthe right to respect for privacy.4Article 3 of the First Protocol to the ECHR states: “The High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secretballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature”.5 See, e.g. the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights arts 39–40 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 art.25, which gofurther than the ECHR in several ways.57[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsis implemented across the entire country, this article argues that the UK Government should be mindfulof its human rights obligations and the experiences in other countries that impose similar identificationrequirements. At the same time, the article may be of interest to stakeholders in other European countrieswhich have similar practices.Following this introduction, Section 2 discusses the rationale and the logistics of the pilot scheme thatwill be trialled in the 2018 local elections in England, before analysing how compulsory voter identificationhas been received elsewhere, in particular the US, to identify what lessons could be learned and whatmistakes could be avoided. In light of this discussion, Section 3 outlines and applies the human rightsframework concerning the “right to vote” before Section 4 concludes and evaluates the UK proposals.2. The introduction of compulsory voter identification and the dangers ofdisenfranchisementIn 2014 the Electoral Commission recommended that voters in Great Britain should be required to provetheir identity when casting their vote, suggesting that voting in person “remains vulnerable to personationfraud” due to the “few checks” in place to prevent impersonation, which could be even more of a risk ifelectoral registration and other voting methods becomemore secure.6 The Electoral Commission followedup these suggestions in 2015 with a proposed proof of identity scheme that could be applied in electionsin Great Britain, drawing upon the experiences of Northern Ireland and Canada, and taking into accountconcerns about compulsory identification.7 The Commission suggested that only the following forms ofidentification should be allowed when voting in person due to certain security features and the verificationprocess when obtaining the document: a photographic driving licence, passport, Proof of Age StandardsScheme (PASS) card, military identification card, police identification card, a firearms licence, and certainphotographic public transport passes.8Proposals to reform electoral practice did not feature in the Conservative Party 2015 manifesto but,amongst other electoral reforms, the 2017 Conservative Party manifesto pledged to “legislate to ensurethat a form of identification must be presented before voting”.9 Following up on that pledge, the CabinetOffice revealed in September 2017 that a pilot study requiring eligible voters to present identificationwould be conducted in the next round of local elections in May 2018 in five areas of England: Woking,Gosport, Bromley, Watford and Slough.10 According to Chris Skidmore, the Minister for the Constitution:“For people to have confidence in our democratic processes we need to ensure that our elections aresafeguarded against any threat or perception of electoral fraud. The current situation of people simplypointing out their name without having to prove who they are feels out of date when consideringother safeguards to protect people’s identity. It is harder to take out a library book or collect a parcelat a post office than it is to vote in someone’s name.”11According to the announcement, the pilot study will test a variety of means of identification whichwill be set by each respective council, but the trial will involve “both photo ID and non-photo ID to seewhat is most effective and efficient”.12 The Electoral Commission has pledged to publish their own research6Electoral Commission, “Electoral Fraud in the UK: Final Report and Recommendations” (January 2014), p.5, https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/164609/Electoral-fraud-review-final-report.pdf [Accessed 22 January 2018].7Electoral Commission, “Delivering and Costing a Proof of Identity Scheme for Polling Station Voters in Great Britain” (December 2015), https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/194719/Proof-of-identity-scheme-updated-March-2016.pdf [Accessed 22 January 2018].8Electoral Commission, “Delivering and Costing a Proof of Identity Scheme for Polling Station Voters in Great Britain” (December 2015), para.4.7.9Conservative Party Manifesto 2017, p.43.10Cabinet Office, “Voter ID Pilot to Launch in Local Elections”, Press Release (16 September 2017).11Cabinet Office, “Voter ID Pilot to Launch in Local Elections”, Press Release (16 September 2017).12Cabinet Office, “Voter ID Pilot to Launch in Local Elections”, Press Release (16 September 2017).58 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorson the issue of compulsory voter identification following the pilot scheme in the English local electionsin May 2018.13The proposals have attracted a great deal of media attention,14 some strong opposition from campaigninggroups,15 and considerable political opposition, primarily from the Labour Party whose supporters arguethat it will be their traditional voter demographic that will be most affected.16 To date, however, there hasbeen little academic commentary on the proposals, or similar European practices, from a legal or humanrights perspective.One possible explanation for this is that compulsory voter identification is not a wholly novel conceptto the UK, as voters in Northern Ireland have been required to submit some form of identification since1985. At the same time, many European countries require (or can request) voters to produce some formof identification when voting in polling stations, for example, France,17 Germany,18 Norway,19 and Spain.20Whilst the issue has attracted considerable attention in some regions where discrimination has been awidespread problem in the past, in particular Africa and Latin America,21 and the US,22 there has been aconsiderable lack of scrutiny in Europe. This divergence is, to some extent, understandable, given theblatant racial discrimination that has shaped much of the political history of the US and the turbulentpolitical climates that still exist in many parts of the world, but one must not forget that it took manycenturies in the UK for the franchise to expand beyond the narrow circle of wealthy middle and upper-classmen to also include women, the young, and the working class.23At this stage, the experiences in Northern Ireland and the US warrant closer examination; the first dueto its obvious cultural, legal and political connection to England and the European human rights framework,and the latter due to the significant legal challenges that have played out in various US states which exposehow controversial compulsory identification can be when fundamental rights are at stake. The legalchallenges that have arisen in the US will provide some clues as to the possible rights-based complaintsthat may arise in England if the proposals are implemented across the country. Furthermore, in contrastto the experience in Northern Ireland, the fierce opposition to strict compulsory identification laws insome US states demonstrates how varied the political and legal responses to compulsory identificationhave been, which should provide the UK authorities with plenty of food for thought.In Northern Ireland eligible voters have been required to present identification when voting in personin polling stations since 1985, with photographic identification being needed since 2003.24 Voters are13The Chief Executive of the Electoral Commission confirmed that “an independent, statutory evaluation of the pilot schemes” will be publishedin summer 2018.14 See, e.g. J.

The first election that took place with this new requirement in force was the November 2003Northern Ireland Assembly elections.Compulsory Voter Identification, Disenfranchisement and Human Rights 59[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsrequired to produce one of seven forms of photographic identification when voting in person.25 Specificallyfor this purpose the Electoral Office in Northern Ireland established the Electoral Identity Card (EIC) toserve as one of the acceptable forms of identification, which individuals can apply for by post or in personif they do not hold one of the other forms of identification. If applying for an EIC in person, the individualmerely has to be on the electoral register and provide their National Insurance Number.26 Crucially, nodirect cost is incurred when registering for the EIC in this way.In contrast to the relatively smooth and uncontentious practice of compulsory voter identification inNorthern Ireland, similar requirements in some US states have proven much more controversial due tothe perceived detrimental impact upon the ability of black and other minorities to vote,27 as well as theburdens imposed on elderly or disabled members of the electorate. Between 1965 and 2013, several statesin the US had to seek Federal approval before amending their electoral rules, due to the historic racialdiscrimination in those states.28 However, following the US Supreme Court decision in Shelby County vHolder in 2013 which determined that the formula used to identify which states were to be subject tofederal oversight was unconstitutional,29 states are now able to amend their electoral rules more freely.In that regard, 34 US states currently impose or will soon impose voter identification laws of somekind.30 There have been many significant legal challenges to some of these laws which have generallybeen dealt with by the respective state’s own judicial system, but the US Supreme Court has occasionallyintervened, demonstrating how seriously the issue of compulsory voter identification is treated. In recentyears, some of the strictest voter identification laws have been challenged in several states, for examplePennsylvania,31 South Carolina,32 North Carolina,33 Georgia,34 Missouri,35 and perhaps most importantlydue to the intervention of the US Supreme Court, Indiana.36Of these states, the changes to the electoral rules in Georgia in 2005 imposed arguably the strictestcompulsory identification rules of all. Following these reforms, voters were required to present photographicidentification.37 No state-issued photographic identification was available free of charge, and provisionalvoting (i.e. allowing an elector to vote subject to a later identification check) was not allowed. Followinga civil action complaint, the District Court found that these requirements placed an undue burden oncitizens, mostly due to the inconvenience of having to travel to registrar offices to acquire a voteridentification card, which was particularly problematic for elderly and disabled electors due to the longqueuing periods.38 In response, the Georgian legislature reformed these requirements and now providefree photographic identification, allow other non-photographic forms of identification in polling stations,and provide provisional ballots.3925Voters may use a UK, Irish or EEA driving licence; a UK, Irish or EU passport; a Translink Senior SmartPass; a Translink 60+ SmartPass; aTranslink War Disabled SmartPass; or a Translink Blind Person’s SmartPass.26Electoral Office for Northern Ireland, Electoral Identity Card: How to apply, http://www.eoni.org.uk/Electoral-Identity-Card/How-to-apply[Accessed 22 January 2018].27 In addition to the literature already cited, see American Civil Liberties Union, Oppose Voter ID Legislation: Fact Sheet, https://www.aclu.org/other/oppose-voter-id-legislation-fact-sheet (last updated May 2017) [Accessed 22 January 2018].28The Voting Rights Act 1965.29 Shelby County v Holder 570 US 2 (2013).30W.

Compulsory voter identification and the EuropeanConvention onHumanRights(a) The human rights frameworkIn matters of democracy and political rights, the most significant international obligations that bind almostall European states stem from (or are complemented by) the ECHR. The European Court of Human Rightshas repeatedly stressed how fundamental democracy is to the ECHR despite the fact that no universallegal definition of democracy exists.45 On a general level, the broad concept of “democracy” and a“democratic society” underpins much of the content of the ECHR.46 Most significantly, the Court hasstated that democracy “is the only political model contemplated in the Convention and the only onecompatible with it”.47The ability of individuals to participate in the political life of the community is guaranteed in a numberof ways, not least of all the freedom of thought conscience and religion under art.9, the freedom of40Weinschenk 203 S.W. 3d 201 (Mo. banc 2006).

Vidmar, “Judicial Interpretations of Democracy in Human Rights Treaties” (2014) 3(2) Cambridge Journal of International and ComparativeLaw 532.46The Preamble of the ECHR states that signatories are “Reaffirming their profound belief in those fundamental freedoms which are the foundationof justice and peace in the world and are best maintained on the one hand by an effective political democracy and on the other by a common understandingand observance of the Human Rights upon which they depend”. Certain rights may be restricted when, inter alia, a restriction is “necessary in ademocratic society”.

However, for thepurposes of this article, art.3 of the First Protocol to the ECHR requires contracting parties to “hold freeelections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expressionof the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature”.48Despite the fact that art.3 of the First Protocol is phrased in general terms, which requires states to“hold elections which ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people rather than in terms of aparticular right or freedom”,49 the Court has confirmed that art.3 includes the implied rights to vote andto stand for election,50 and to sit as a member of the legislature if elected.51 Such is the importance of theserights that the Court has stressed that they are “crucial to establishing and maintaining the foundations ofan effective and meaningful democracy governed by the rule of law”.52The European Court has had to deal with a whole variety of issues concerning art.3 of the First Protocoland disenfranchisement. For example, the Court has found a violation of art.3 of the First Protocol in thefollowing circumstances: the banning of all individuals placed under protection on psychiatric groundsfrom voting without taking into account the actual mental faculties of individuals53; the barring of individualsfacing bankruptcy proceedings from voting when the ban served no purpose other than to belittle them54;and, in the context of Cyprus, the banning of Turkish Cypriots from voting in national elections.55 On theother hand, the Court has accepted that placing restrictions upon who can vote may be necessary, forexample, when imposing a minimum age in order to ensure the maturity of the electorate,56 or whenrestricting voter eligibility to individuals with continuous or close links to the country concerned.57In the UK, the most contentious issue that raises persistent moral and legal questions aboutdisenfranchisement stems from the blanket ban on prisoners being able to vote. In this respect the UK isone of the few countries in Europe to operate a blanket ban and completely prohibit prisoners from castingtheir vote in elections, drawing repeated criticism from the European Court of Human Rights.58 However,it appears that the UK’s hard-line approach may be eased somewhat in the near future, following theannouncement that a limited number of prisoners may be able to vote, namely, those sentenced to lessthan one year of imprisonment and who are on day release on the day of an election.59When dealing with the issue of disenfranchisement the Court has noted that the right to vote is not aprivilege,60 and that the presumption in democratic states “must be in favour of inclusion” which has beenillustrated by European history where the franchise has been gradually extended well beyond narrowcircles defined by wealth and gender.61 Inherent to the ECHR, but also stressed in other sources ofinternational law, the basic principle in democracies is one of universal suffrage.6248 See also ICCPR art.25(b).49See, e.g. Yumak v Turkey (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 4 at [109];Hirst v United Kingdom (No.2) (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 41 at [56];Grosaru v Romania (2015)61 E.H.R.R. 1 at [42].50Mathieu-Mohin v Belgium (1988) 10 E.H.R.R. 1 at [46]–[51]; Sitaropoulos v Greece (2013) 56 E.H.R.R. 9 at [63]; Scoppola v Italy (No.3) (2013)56 E.H.R.R. 19 at [81]; Hirst (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 41 at [57].

Inthat regard the European Court of Human Rights has made it clear that “a difference in treatment maytake the form of disproportionately prejudicial effects of a general policy or measure which, thoughcouched in neutral terms, discriminates against a group”.70 Thus, if a neutral rule or practice is significantlymore negative in its effects upon a protected group, as compulsory identification laws have proven to bein some US states, there may be a credible complaint of indirect discrimination against the authorities.(b) The English local elections 2018 and electoral reform in Great BritainIn light of the legal framework just outlined and the experience in other countries discussed earlier, thissection assesses the UK’s proposals and attempts to identify what issues concerning the right to vote underart.3 of the First Protocol to the ECHR are likely to arise. Clearly, for compulsory voter identification tocomply with the requirements of the ECHR, a number of issues need to be carefully considered. Crucially,such a requirement must not curtail the right to vote in a way that impairs its essence and effectiveness;the conditions imposed must be proportionate and pursue a legitimate aim; the free expression of thepeople must not be thwarted; the requirement must be concerned with the integrity and effectiveness ofthe election process; and, if relevant, the exclusion of any group of the public must be reconcilable withthe purpose of art.3 of the First Protocol.When considering voter identification laws several of these important principles can be consideredtogether. First, requiring voters to produce some form of identification when voting in person undoubtedlypursues a legitimate aim.

Even ifconducted on a relatively low scale with little or no bearing upon the results of elections, electoral fraudunquestionably has the potential to reduce the confidence that the general public will place in the democraticprocess. In this regard, evidence has suggested that voters in Northern Ireland, where photographicidentification is required, are generally more confident that the election process is better-run than the restof the UK.72However, a much more challenging question concerns the proportionality of compulsory voteridentification and, consequently, the need to determine whether such a requirement will impair the essenceand effectiveness of the right to vote. Ultimately, as the European Court of Human Rights has made clear,the free expression of the people must not be thwarted by the imposition of any conditions.Dealing with these issues together, a number of general observations can be made. First, of the 51.4million votes cast in the various elections in 2015 in the entire UK, there were 481 allegations of electoralfraud, of which only 123 concerned the actual voting process, which includes not just personification butalso breaches of secrecy requirements, tampering with ballot papers, bribery, and treating or undueinfluence.73 Second, whilst there are obviously a variety of factors to consider when analysing voter turnout,the turnout in Northern Ireland has been the lowest of the four UK regions in the three most recent GeneralElections (2010, 2015, 2017) that have taken place since the introduction of compulsory photographicidentification in Northern Ireland in 2003.74 As such, it might be immediately questioned whetherpersonification is sufficiently serious to justify such a considerable overhaul of the voting process thatwill place a burden, however minimal that may be, upon the entire electorate.Bearing this in mind, according to the Electoral Commission’s own estimates of the electorate in 2013,approximately 3.5 million electors (7.5% of the electorate) in Great Britain do not own one of the formsof photographic identification that the Commission recommended should be required to vote in pollingstations.75 In other words, only 92.5% of electors in Great Britain would already have at least one form ofacceptable photo identification. If only passports, photographic driving licences and Oyster Photocardswere to be accepted this would leave 6 million electors (13% of the electorate) unable to vote.76 Even moretroubling, if this was limited to just passports and photographic driving licences, the Commission estimatedthat 11 million electors (24% of the electorate) would be unable to vote.However, in light of the experience in some US states, a much more complex and problematic issuefrom the perspective of art.3 of the First Protocol and art.14 of the ECHR concerns the impact of compulsoryvoter identification laws upon certain communities, especially poor, minority and elderly citizens. In thisregard, the Electoral Commission has revealed that, according to the 2011 Census, only 66% of individualswho identify as White (Gypsy or Irish Travellers) hold eligible passports, compared to 83% of White(English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British) and just under 85% of Mixed/Multiple Ethnic Groups(White and Black Caribbean).77 Compulsory identification may also have a detrimental impact uponwomen, the young and the elderly, who are far less likely to possess a driving licence than middle-aged71Cabinet Office, “Voter ID Pilot to Launch in Local Elections”, Press Release (16 September 2017).72Electoral Commission, “Voting in 2017: Understanding Public Attitudes Towards Elections and Voting” (October 2017), https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/234893/Voting-in-2017-Final.pdf Chart 4.1 [Accessed 22 January 2018].73Electoral Commission, “Analysis of Cases of Alleged Electoral Fraud in the UK in 2015” (March 2016), http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/198533/Fraud-allegations-data-report-2015.pdf, pp.3–5 [Accessed 22 January 2018].74 In the 2005 General Election, voter turnout in Northern Ireland was the highest of the UK’s four regions. This might be explained, to some extent,by the considerable publicity drive which followed the introduction of compulsory photographic identification in 2003. See Electoral Commission,“Delivering and Costing a Proof of Identity Scheme for Polling Station Voters in Great Britain”, para.2.18. For the statistics see Electoral Commission,“Voting in 2017: Understanding Public Attitudes Towards Elections and Voting”, Table 2.1.75Electoral Commission, “Delivering and Costing a Proof of Identity Scheme for Polling Station Voters in Great Britain”, para.4.10. As noted above,these are: a photographic driving licence, passport, Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) card, military identification card, police identificationcard, a firearms licence, and certain photographic public transport passes.76Electoral Commission, “Delivering and Costing a Proof of Identity Scheme for Polling Station Voters in Great Britain”, para.4.10.77Electoral Commission, “Delivering and Costing a Proof of Identity Scheme for Polling Station Voters in Great Britain”, para.4.12.64 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsmales. Recent statistics compiled by the Department of Transport in 2016 reveal that in England, 91% ofmales aged 50–59 own driving licences in comparison to just 29% of females aged 17–20.78 Lastly, whilstbeing a distinct issue in itself, there is also a significant difference in the proportion of certain ethnicitiesbeing registered to vote. In 2014, approximately 85.9% people identifying as White were registered tovote, in comparison to 83.7% of the Asian community, 76% of the Black community, 73.4%who identifiedas Mixed, and just 62.9% who identified as Other.79Although these statistics only paint part of the picture, they reveal that millions of citizens couldpotentially be disenfranchised if the UK Government decides to implement strict identification laws inthe UK. If the Government envisaged a new voting process whereby only passports or driving licenceswould be deemed acceptable forms of identification, there would be a genuine risk of indirect discriminationagainst ethnic minorities, women, the young and the elderly. Equally, if a freely available form ofphotographic identification was established but the individual had to provide expensive forms ofGovernment-issued identification to prove their identity and acquire such a document, the problem wouldnot dissipate.Acknowledging these issues to some extent, Chris Skidmore,Minister for the Constitution, has confirmedthat whilst participating councils will trial different forms of identification in the pilot scheme in May2018, no one will have to purchase identification.80 Looking further ahead, the Electoral Commission hasalready recommended that a photographic identity card similar to that offered in Northern Ireland shouldbe made freely available to voters in Great Britain, should photographic identification become compulsoryin elections, so as to not disenfranchise the estimated 7.5% of the electorate in Great Britain who do notalready possess one of the proposed forms of acceptable identification.81 Nevertheless, experience in theUS has shown that there can be considerable hidden costs when it comes to attaining freely providedphotographic identification, not least of all travel expenditure and the costs incurred when acquiring thenecessary evidentiary documents. In contrast, and arguably demonstrating the best solution to this problem,to attain the EIC in Northern Ireland voters can either apply by post by providing a form of photographicidentification or a form signed by an elected official, or if applying in person, they must present a nationalinsurance number and be registered on the Electoral Register.824. ConclusionsThis article has examined the human rights implications of the British Government’s proposals to reformthe electoral process in Great Britain and, in particular, the announcement that a pilot study will be carriedout in the May 2018 local elections in England, which will require eligible voters to produce some formof identification when voting in polling stations. Whilst the European Court of Human Rights has granteda wide margin of appreciation to states when it comes to the organising and running of electoral systems,83the Court has made it clear that any conditions that restrict the right to vote must satisfy a number ofrequirements, not least that the free expression of the people to choose the legislature must not be thwarted.84In contrast to compulsory identification laws in Northern Ireland which have been received relativelywell, recent disputes in several US states indicate to some extent what complaints in respect of civil rightsmay arise in England and the UK as a whole if the proposals are implemented. These issues should be78Department for Transport, Full Car Driving Licence Holders by Age and Gender: England, 1975/1976 to 2016 (Table NTS0201).79Electoral Commission, “Delivering and Costing a Proof of Identity Scheme for Polling Station Voters in Great Britain”, para.4.13.80C.

Furthermore, the process of applying for this documentshould not impose any unreasonable burdens, for example, by requiring voters to produce expensive formsof Government-issued identification such as a passport or a driving licence. It is also important that votersin Great Britain should be allowed to cast a provisional vote, subject to verification, should they forget tobring an acceptable form of identification on the day of the election. Ultimately, at a time when voterapathy amongst the electorate is consistently highlighted as a real cause for concern, it might be arguedthat the Government should not be considering such fundamental reforms, however well-intentioned therationale may be, in response to what is a relatively insignificant problem and in a way that may in factdiscourage or even thwart the free expression of the people to choose the legislature.66 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCase AnalysisSweet Taste with Bitter Roots—Forced Labourand Chowdury v GreeceDr Vladislava Stoyanova*Ragnar Söderberg Associate Senior Lecturer, Faculty of Law, Lund University, SwedenDuty to undertake effective investigation; Forced labour; Greece; Human trafficking; Positiveobligations; Seasonal workersAbstractChowdury v Greece1 reveals the exploitation that migrant workers suffer at agricultural farms forproduction of strawberries whose sweet taste many of us enjoy. Greece was found in violation of art.4 ofthe ECHR (the right not to be subjected to forced labour and human trafficking) for its failure to protectthe migrants from the exploitation and to conduct effective investigation. The judgment will be laurelledas an important achievement in favour of the rights of undocumented migrant workers to fair workingconditions. It sheds light on the application of the definition of forced labour to labour performed byundocumented migrants. It also contributes to the enhancement of states’ positive obligations under art.4of the ECHR. It suggests that the obligations imposed by the Council of Europe Convention on Actionagainst Trafficking in Human Beings are of relevance not only to factual circumstances qualified as humantrafficking, but to the whole gamut of abuses intended to be captured by art.4 of the ECHR.1. IntroductionChowdury v Greece revealed the human cost that migrants pay so that many of us enjoy the sweet tasteof strawberries grown at farms. The judgment will be laurelled as an important achievement in favour ofthe rights of undocumentedmigrant workers to fair working conditions. The applicants were 42 Bangladeshinationals in Greece with undocumented status. They were recruited to work on a strawberry farm inManolada, Greece, and were promised wages of €22 for seven hours’ labour and €3 for each overtimehour. They worked in plastic greenhouses picking strawberries every day from 07.00 until 19.00 inscorching heat under the supervision of armed guards. They lived in makeshifts tents of cardboard boxesand nylon without running water and toilets. The workers were never paid their wages for which theywent on strike a couple of times. Despite not being paid, they continued to work since they were afraidthat if they were to leave, they would be never paid. After the recruitment of other migrants by the sameemployer, the Bangladeshi nationals went on strike again to demand their wages. At this point, one of thearmed guards opened fire and seriously injured many of them. After this incident, the employer and theguards were convicted for grievous bodily harm and unlawful use of firearms (sentences that weresubsequently commuted to a minimum financial penalty), but acquitted of the charge of trafficking inhuman beings. The 42 Bangladeshi migrants argued before the European Court of Human Rights (theCourt) that they were subjected to forced labour and human trafficking and that Greece failed to fulfil its*Dr Vladislava Stoyanova intervened in the case by submitting a third-party-intervention on behalf of the law faculty (co-authored with EleniKarageorgiou).

The Court agreed with these claims and ordered Greece to pay each applicantbetween €12,000 and €16,000. This order can be regarded as an achievement given the stark reality thatexploited migrants rarely, if ever, receive any compensation.2This article assesses the contribution of Chowdury in two respects. First, the judgment contributes tothe resolution of some of the definitional challenges raised by art.4 of the ECHR, a provision that hasproduced relatively limited judicial output.3 The definitional clarifications offered in the judgment are ofimportance not only for the future case-law in this area, but also for the national legislation of the Councilof Europe (CoE) states. For example, the UKModern Slavery Act does not define the elements of slavery,servitude and forced labour; instead, it refers to art.4 of the ECHR. Despite this positive contribution ofthe judgment, some definitional complications under art.4 have still remain unresolved. Second, thesignificance of Chowdury also lies in the further integration of the Council of Europe Convention onAction against Human Trafficking CETS No.197 (the CoE Anti-Trafficking Convention) within thepositive obligations generated by art.4 of the ECHR.2. The definitional challenges raised by art.4 of the ECHRIn terms of definitional challenges, Chowdury has three distinctive features that need to be highlightedfrom the outset. It is the first case in which the European Court determined that the conditions under whichundocumented migrant workers had to labour amounted to forced labour. The previous two cases, i.e.Siliadin v France4 and CN v France,5 involved migrant children who had to provide domestic services inthe home of their abusers, which signified specificities potentially preventing the extrapolation of thereasoning to wider circumstances. A second feature that denotes distinctiveness to the Chowdury case isthat, in contrast to Siliadin and CN v France where the applicants were determined to be both victims offorced labour and servitude,6 inChowdury the level of severity of the abuses was found not to have reachedthe threshold of servitude. This gave the Court the possibility to introduce further clarity as to the distinctionbetween forced labour and servitude under art.4 of the ECHR. Against the background of the existingcase-law under art.4, a third distinctive feature of Chowdury is that the Court applied both concepts, i.e.human trafficking and forced labour, to the factual circumstances. In its previous judgments, the Courtused either human trafficking (see Rantsev v Cyprus,7LE v Greece8 and J v Austria9) or the conceptsexplicitly enshrined in the text of art.4 (see Siliadin,CN v France and CN v United Kingdom.)10 In fact, inCN v France the Court explicitly noted its preference to the legal concepts specifically provided for inthe Convention. More specifically, it held:“It is true that in the case of Rantsev v Cyprus and Russia the Court affirmed that human traffickingitself falls within the scope of Article 4 of the Convention in so far as it is without doubt a phenomenonthat runs counter to the spirit and purpose of that provision. However, it considers that, above all,the facts of the present case concern activities related to ‘forced labour’ and ‘servitude’, legal conceptsspecifically provided for in the Convention.”112 Severe Labour Exploitation: Workers Moving within or into the European Union (EU Agency of Fundamental Rights, 2015), p.21.3V.

In M and Others v Italy (App. No.40020/03), judgment of 31 July 2012 at[146]–[170], the Court did refer to all four concepts; however, none of themwas found applicable and the complaint under art.4 was found inadmissible.11CN and V (App. No.67724/09) at [88].68 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsNo elucidation was offered as to why a preference was given to the “legal concepts specifically providedfor in the Convention”. As I will show below, Chowdury has not resolved the obscurity surrounding thecase-law as to when and why the Court will prefer to take “human trafficking” on board and as to howthis concept actually relates to those explicit in the text of art.4 of the ECHR.Before assessing the significance of these innovations and persisting ambiguities, it is worthwhile toremind ourselves that art.4 contains three concepts, i.e. slavery, servitude and forced labour. With Rantsev(at [286]) the Court has added “human trafficking”, as defined in the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppressand Punish Trafficking in Persons12 and the CoE Trafficking Convention, to the conceptual apparatus ofart.4.13 In sum, art.4 captures four concepts for qualifying abuses and the Court needs to find some sensibleway of distinguishing them and of denoting some distinctiveness to each one of them.2.1 Undocumented migrants and the definition of forced labourThe Court has addressed the distinctive definitional contours of forced labour in its previous judgments.In Van der Mussele v Belgium and in Siliadin, the Court took into account the definition of forced labourin the ILO Forced Labour Convention No.29, where the term is defined as “all work or service which isexacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offeredhimself voluntarily”.14 Pursuant to this definition, involuntariness is one of the necessary definitionalelements together with menace of penalty. In this sense, it can be argued that “forced labour” is not intendedto capture exploitative and abusive working conditions per se; one can labour in acceptable workingconditions, but still involuntarily and thus be subjected to forced labour.15 This creates two problems intwo different kinds of situations. First, a person might work in severely exploitative working conditionsto which she/he consents, which might potentially render the concept of forced labour inoperative. Thesituation of the 42 Bangladeshi migrant workers in the Chowdury could potentially fall into this category.However, this pitfall was avoided; below, I will show how. Second, a person might be required to do somelabour under acceptable conditions, to which he objects and is threatened with a penalty,16 which arguablyrenders the circumstances forced labour.As early as 1983 when Van der Mussele was delivered, a case about a lawyer required to provide probono legal services to indigent clients, the Court realised the problem with the simplistic and unhelpfuldichotomy between voluntary versus involuntary labour. One of the implications from this problemwouldbe rendering the concept of forced labour impotent to capture exploitative working conditions. Anotheradverse implication would be preventing states from requiring certain services from individuals since theimposition of this requirement might potentially amount to forced labour. In Van der Mussele the Courtthus held that:“… relative weight is to be attached to the argument regarding the applicant’s ‘prior consent’, theCourt will have regard to all the circumstances of the case in the light of the underlying objectivesof Article 4 of the European Convention in order to determine whether the service required of Mr.Van der Mussele falls within the prohibition of compulsory labour. This could be so in the case of a12 2237 UNTS 319, entered into forced 25 December 2003.13 For a critique of this addition, see V. Stoyanova, “Dancing on the Borders of Article 4.

Stoyanova,Human Trafficking and Slavery Reconsidered. Conceptual Limits and States’ Positive Obligations in European Law (Cambridge University Press,2017), p.267.16The “menace of penalty” has been interpreted widely and it does not pose a serious definitional challenge. “Menace of any penalty should beunderstood in a very broad sense. … The penalty here in question might also take the form of a loss of rights or privileges.” International LabourConference, General Survey on the Fundamental Conventions concerning Rights at Work in Light of the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for FairGlobalization, Report III (Part 1B) (ILO, 2013), p.111. The European Court has also followed this wide approach to the definition of “menace ofpenalty”. For example, in Van der Mussele the threat of being deregistered from the list of lawyers was found to suffice.Case Analysis 69[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsservice required in order to gain access to a given profession, if the service imposed a burden whichwas so excessive or disproportionate to the advantages attached to the future exercise of thatprofession, that the service could not be treated as having been voluntarily accepted beforehand[emphasis added].”17Crucially, the Court invoked the disproportionate burden test. After assessing the situation of the applicant,the Court concluded that he did not have to bear such a burden and, therefore, he was not subjected toforced or compulsory labour.The circumstances in Van der Mussele involved labour demanded by the state. Siliadin was the firstjudgment involving interpersonal harm (a child migrant required to labour in deplorable conditions inprivate households). Siliadin does not contain very sophisticated analysis as to whether the girl wassubjected to forced labour. The Court simply determined that she was “an adolescent girl in a foreign land,unlawfully present on French territory and in fear of arrest by the police” and that “it is clear from thefacts of the case that it cannot seriously be maintained” “that she performed the work of her own free will”([118]–[119]). In contrast, CN v France did offer a more elaborate analysis. The applicants were two girlsrequired to provide domestic services at home. They were arguably treated as family members fromwhomit was expected to help with the household chores. Here the Court invoked the disproportionate burdentest for the first time in the circumstances of interpersonal harm and observed that:“… the first applicant was forced to work so hard that without her aid Mr and Mrs M. would havehad to employ and pay a professional housemaid. The second applicant, on the other hand, has notadduced sufficient proof that she contributed in any excessive measure to the upkeep of Mr and MrsM.’s household [emphasis added].”18Chowdury is the second judgment involving interpersonal harm where the disproportionate burden testwas invoked.19 It was acknowledged that the migrants did initially consent to work; however, the Courtalso observed that “[t]he validity of the consent must be assessed in the light of all the circumstances ofthe case”. This implied taking into consideration “the nature and volume of the activity in question”. Thenature and the volume of the work performed, including the nature of the working conditions that mightmanifest excessiveness, are ultimately determinative. In this respect the Court observed: “The workerslaboured in extreme physical conditions, had an exhausting schedule and were subjected to constanthumiliation”.20 As a consequence, severely exploitative working conditions can be captured by thedefinitional scope of forced labour even if the person has consented:“By promising them rudimentary shelter and a daily wage of EUR 22, which was the only solutionfor the victims to ensure a means of subsistence, the employer had been able to obtain their consentat the time of hiring in order to exploit them later.”21What is particularly important in the assessment of these conditions is the strong emphasis on the applicants’vulnerability that originated from their irregular migration status. This is one of the most importantcontributions of Chowdury:“… the applicants did not have a residence permit or a work permit. The applicants were aware thattheir irregular situation put them at risk of being arrested and detained with a view of deportationfrom Greek territory. An attempt to leave their work would no doubt have increased this prospect17Van der Mussele (1984) 6 E.H.R.R. 163 at [37].18CN and V (App. No.67724/09) at [75].19Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [90]–[91]; see also [96].20Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [98].21Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [98].70 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsand would have meant loss of any hope of receiving their salaries or at least part of them. Given thatthey had not received any salary, they could not leave Greece.”22The Court also added that:“… the applicants began working in a situation of vulnerability as irregular migrants without resourcesand at risk of being arrested, detained and deported. They probably realized that if they stoppedworking, they would never collect the arears of their wages, the amount of which was constantlyincreasing as the days passed. Even assuming that, at the time of hiring, the applicant volunteeredtheir work and believed in good faith that they would receive their wages, the situation subsequentlychanged as a result of their employers.”23In sum, “forced labour” captures severely exploitative working conditions and the element of consent hasbeen reduced to an assessment of the excessiveness of these conditions.2.2 The distinction between forced labour and servitudeOne of the challenging definitional issues in Chowdury was caused by the fact that the migrant workerscould freely leave the strawberry farm and go to the nearby city, including to do their shopping. In fact,at certain point their employer told them to leave the farm. They refused, since they believed that thecontinuation of the employment relationship was essential for them to recover their salaries. Given thefreedom that the migrants had, the Court was confronted for the first time with the question whetherdeprivation of liberty or some form of restriction on freedom of movement are necessary or relevantelements for the qualification of the situation as forced labour.24 This question prompted the Court tofurther clarify the distinction between forced labour and servitude. Importantly, it excluded restrictionson freedom of movement as a necessary element for defining forced labour; however, it preserved therelevance of this element for the purpose of qualifying situations as servitude:“The Court observes that the Patras Assize Court acquitted the defendants of the count of traffickingin human beings, in particular by noting that the workers were not absolutely unable to protectthemselves and that their freedom of movement was not compromised, on the grounds that they werefree to leave their work (see paragraphs 26–27 above). However, the Court considers that the restrictionon freedom of movement is not a sine qua non condition for qualifying a situation as forced labouror even as trafficking in human beings. This form of restriction does not refer to the provision of thework itself, but rather to certain aspects of the life of the victim of a situation contrary to Article 4of the Convention, and in particular to a situation of servitude. On this point the Court reiterates itsfinding that Patras Assize Court had a narrow interpretation of the concept of trafficking, which reliedon elements specific to servitude in order not to qualify the applicants’ situation as trafficking (seeparagraph 100 above). However, a situation of trafficking can exist despite the freedom of movementof the victim.”25It follows that restrictions upon freedom of movement might be a relevant element for defining abuses asservitude. A question that still needs to be unequivocally resolved is whether such restrictions are anecessary element for qualifying circumstances as servitude. There are persuasive arguments to the22Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [95].23Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [97].24The ECHR draws the distinction between deprivation of liberty (art.5) and restriction on freedom of movement (art.2(3), Protocol 4). The EuropeanCourt has clarified that the difference between the two is “one of degree or intensity, and not of nature or substance”. August v United Kingdom [GC](App. No.39692/09, 40713/09 and 41008/09), judgment of 15 March 2012 at [57]. A context specific assessment needs to be applied for determiningwhether restrictions on freedom of movement amount to deprivation of liberty (i.e. detention).25Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [123]. In section 2.3 below I explain the conflation of forced labour and human trafficking in the judgment.Case Analysis 71[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorscontrary. The starting point for advancing these arguments is the following pronouncement from CN vFrance and Chowdury:“… servitude corresponds to a special type of forced or compulsory labour or, in other words,‘aggravated’ forced or compulsory labour. As a matter of fact, the fundamental distinguishing featurebetween servitude and forced or compulsory labour within the meaning of Article 4 of the Conventionlies in the victim’s feeling that their condition is permanent and that the situation is unlikely to change.It is sufficient that this feeling be based on the above-mentioned objective criteria or brought aboutor kept alive by those responsible for the situation [emphasis added].”26Deprivation of liberty and restrictions upon freedom of movement might indeed be one of these objectivecriteria that the Court has invoked for demonstrating the victims’ feeling that their condition is permanentand not likely to change. However, other objective circumstances might also provoke such feelings. Anexample to this effect could be exercising subtle forms of control over various aspects of victims’ lives.The required level of control and the aspects of life upon which control is exerted (the place where thevictim lives, the persons that he/she is allowed to meet and talk to etc), remain to be tested in future cases.Here it is pertinent to note that in CN v United Kingdom, the Court observed that:“… domestic servitude is a specific offence, distinct from trafficking and exploitation, which involvesa complex set of dynamics, involving both overt and more subtle forms of coercion, to forcecompliance. A thorough investigation into complaints of such conduct therefore requires anunderstanding of the many subtle ways an individual can fall under the control of another.”[emphasisadded] 27This is a strong indication that it is not necessary to prove restrictions upon freedom of movement. It willsuffice to demonstrate that the victim was under control, including by the application of subtle forms ofcoercion, for reaching the definition threshold of servitude.2.3 The insertion of human trafficking within the conceptual limits of art.4In Chowdury, the Court concluded that the migrant workers were subjected to both human trafficking andforced labour, in this way confirming that in some respects these forms of abuses can occur at the sametime or one might happen after the other. More specifically, the judgment says that “… exploitation oflabour is one of the forms of exploitation in the definition of trafficking in human beings, which highlightsthe intrinsic relationship between forced and compulsory labour and trafficking in human beings”.28 Yet,this intrinsic relationship is not one of overlap.29 It is regrettable that the Court did not explain this intrinsicrelationship; rather the judgment seems to suggest that these two forms of abuses overlap.It is also worthwhile to remind the reader that in Rantsev the Court conflates human trafficking andslavery by defining the former through the definition of slavery in international law,30 which has causedfurther confusion. Just as confusing, in some paragraphs in the reasoning in Chowdury the Court talksonly about human trafficking (see, e.g. [86], [87], [89]) without mentioning forced labour. Even morepuzzlingly, in other paragraphs the Court refers not only to human trafficking, but also to the concept ofexploitation ([88] and [93]). “Exploitation” is not only left undefined, but as the international law definition26CN and V (App. No.67724/09) at [91]; Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [99].

No explanation has been offered as to the required threshold for defining exploitationand how it might relate to forced labour and servitude in the context of art.4, which has left the minimumthreshold of severity under art.4 uncertain. Equally confusingly, in [99], the Court refers not to forcedlabour per se, but only to forced labour as a form of exploitation within the definition of human trafficking.In sum, the European Court seems to be still struggling with the conceptual apparatus of art.4. The sourceof this confusion is ultimately the insertion of human trafficking within the limits of art.4 and not clarifyinghow this concept differs and relates to those that are explicit in the text of the provision.3. The positive obligations triggered by art.4In addition to these three distinctive features concerning the definitional scope of art.4 of the ECHR thatI elaborated on above, Chowdury is also important from the perspective of the positive obligations thatthis provision generates. Three types of positive obligations were under review: the obligation to adopteffective regulatory framework, to take protective operational measures and to conduct effectiveinvestigation. In what follows, the first two will be examined. Although important in the context of thespecific case, the third one is excluded from the ambit of this article because this part of the judgmentdoes not contain innovative aspects or contentious issues.3.1 The obligation to criminaliseGreece was found not to be in violation of its obligation under art.4 to put in place an appropriate legaland regulatory framework. As the Court emphasised, Greece had criminalised human trafficking at nationallevel and had incorporated the relevant EU law in this area.31 This finding is puzzling given the fact that,while Greece has indeed criminalised human trafficking, the Greek legislation does not contain a specificcriminalisation of forced labour and servitude. In Siliadin and CN v France, the Court is adamant to theeffect that states need to incorporate specific criminalisation of forced labour and servitude at domesticlevel.32CN vUnited Kingdom is also supportive in this respect since the Court stated that domestic servitudewas a specific offence distinct from human trafficking.33 If the same logic is followed, forced labour isalso a specific offence distinct from human trafficking, which necessitates its specific criminalisation atnational level.The omission by the Court to challenge this gap in the national criminal legislation further exacerbatesthe definitional confusion at the level of art.4 and that, as mentioned in section 2.3, has its origins in theinsertion of the concept of human trafficking. Another implication from this omission is that states arenot encouraged to specifically criminalise forced labour; instead, they can use the label of human traffickingto investigate and prosecute exploitation of migrant workers. This might lead to failures in the criminalproceedings since, for example, no elements of recruitment or transportation might be present and thusthe definition of human trafficking might be inapplicable. This problem became evident in CN.34Just as importantly, when human trafficking and forced labour are conflated, it might be impossibleto gain a clear understanding of the nature and the forms of abuses to which migrants are subjected. Thisin turn might hamper the adoption of measures for effective response. More specifically, human traffickingis an abusive and deceptive process that might or might not result in exploitation.35 As opposed to forced31Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [107]–[108].32V.

Different measures might be appropriate for addressing exploitationas opposed to addressing the preceding process.There is one feature that distinguishes Chowdury from CN v United Kingdom, which can explain whythe Court took different approaches. In particular, CN v United Kingdom is distinctive in the followingway. Due to the gap in the domestic criminal law at the material time (absence of a specific offence ofservitude) and the exclusive focus on the crime of human trafficking, the investigating authorities did notgive due weight to “overt and more subtle forms of coercion” to which migrants were vulnerable.Consequently, the national investigating authorities conducted a dismissive investigation. In this sense,there was a causal link between the absence of a specific national offence of servitude and the dismissiveinvestigation into the alleged abuses at national level.36 In contrast, in Chowdury no such link was presentand the national investigation was in general deficient even under the count of human trafficking.37 Thisled to the Court to find a violation of the procedural limb of art.4.3.2 The obligation to take protective operational measuresAnother type of positive obligation under review in the judgment was the obligation to adopt protectiveoperational measures. The Court emphasised that the authorities were well aware of the situation of themigrant workers in the Manolada region and of the abuses to which they were exposed, including therefusals by the employers to pay their wages.38 Despite this awareness, the authorities’ response waslimited.39 Importantly, the assessment of the positive obligation to protect by the Court was done in lightof the positive obligations imposed by the CoE Anti-Trafficking Convention.40 This approach has beenapplied in previous judgments and the Court has thus drawn from this Convention to strengthen states’positive obligations under art.4.41 Still, Chowdurymanifests one innovative feature. More specifically, theCourt referred to the work of the CoE Anti-Trafficking Conventions’ monitoring body, GRETA (Groupof Experts on Actions against Trafficking in Human Beings): “The Court draws its inspiration from thisConvention and from the manner in which it is interpreted by GRETA”.42 This will increase the importanceof the interpretations offered by GRETA in its reports.The more pioneering aspect of Chowdury is the suggestion that regardless of the legal qualification ofthe circumstances as human trafficking or forced labour, the positive obligations generated by art.4 of theECHRmust in principle be interpreted in light of the CoE Anti-Trafficking Convention. This is importantfor two reasons. First, the latter convention imposes a number of positive obligations upon states(identification of victims, suspension of deportation proceedings, social assistance, non-punishment etc).43Their personal scope is limited to victims of human trafficking and, as a consequence, victims of forcedlabour, servitude and slavery fall in a protection gap. This has been highlighted by the EU FundamentalRights Agency:“While trafficking has attracted much attention, the severe exploitation of workers in employmentrelationships—which may or may not occur in a context of trafficking—has not. This difference inthe level of attention is reflected by an institutional setting in which specialized actors are availableto deal with trafficking cases but not with cases of severe labour exploitation.”4436On the issue of causation under the ECHRmore generally see V. Stoyanova, “Causation between State Omission and Harm within the Frameworkof Positive Obligations under the ECHR” (2018) 18(2) H.R.L.R..37Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [121] and [127].38Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [110]–[115].39Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [113].40Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [104].41Rantsev (2010) 43 E.H.R.R. 16 at [285], [287] and [296]; LE v Greece at [71].42Chowdury (App. No.21884/15) at [104].43Stoyanova,Human Trafficking and Slavery Reconsidered.

Limitations upon the usage of the concept of human trafficking can be welcomed given thatthe elements of this concept are yet to be specifically clarified by the Court and that it has an uncertainseverity threshold (see section 2.3 above).4. ConclusionAgainst the background of the relative scarcity of judicial engagement at international law level with theright not to be subjected to slavery, servitude, forced labour and human trafficking,46 Chowdury is animportant addition. It will help art.4 of the ECHR to gain further traction by instigating more applications.The judgment sheds light on the definition of forced labour. It clarifies that the concept captures severelyexploitative working conditions. It also clarifies that consent to perform the labour can be reduced to anassessment of the excessiveness of these conditions. Crucially, any vulnerabilities stemming from irregularmigration status are an inherent part of this assessment. As importantly, a migrant might be held in forcedlabour even if not subjected to any form deprivation of freedom of movement. Chowdury also contributesto the enhancement of states’ positive obligations under art.4. Its reasoning suggests that the positiveobligations imposed by the CoE Anti-Trafficking Convention are of relevance not only to factualcircumstances qualified as human trafficking, but to the whole gamut of abuses intended to be capturedby art.4. This can trigger a change in these CoE states that have limited their identification and assistanceefforts to victims of human trafficking and have ignored victims of severe forms of labour exploitation(i.e. slavery, servitude and forced labour).45This will be contrary to the interpretative principles of effectiveness and internal consistency developed by the Court.46V.

GrandChamber and committee judgments are final. Within three months of a chamber judgment either theapplicant or the respondent government may request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber. Achamber judgment becomes final when the parties confirm that they will not seek a referral to the GrandChamber, when three months have elapsed from the date of the chamber judgment without any requestfor a referral, or, if there has been such a request, when a panel of the Grand Chamber rejects it.Pilot judgments and follow-up casesPilot judgments—non-enforcement—delayed enforcement—repetitive cases—Ukraine—structuralproblems—principle of subsidiarity—division of tasks—Committee of MinistersAccess to justice; Enforcement; European Court of Human Rights; Friendly settlement procedure;Right to effective remedy; Subsidiarity; UkraineBurmych v Ukraine (Applications No.46852/13)European Court of Human Rights (Grand Chamber): Judgment of 12 October 2017 (striking out)FactsThe present case concerns the phenomenon of repetitive cases, the practice of pilot judgments and therole played by different incumbents regarding compliance with the European Human Rights Convention.The disputed issue regards concern prolonged non-enforcement of domestic final judicial decisions.In a previous pilot judgment, the Ivanov v Ukraine (App. No.40450/04, judgment of 15 October 2009),the Court had diagnosed that the prolonged non-enforcement of domestic decisions was a structuralproblem affecting Ukraine. This problem became evident after a decade of cases settled or decided againstUkraine. The main reason for lack of enforcement relates to lack of funds from so-called state debtors aswell as other shortcomings in the national legislation.When the Ivanov case was decided, there were 1,400cases pending before the Court on similar grounds. At the time the Court decided that the respondent statehad to “set up without delay, and at the least within one year from the date on which the judgment becomesfinal” an effective domestic remedy or remedies to secure adequate and sufficient redress for thenon-enforcement or delayed enforcement of domestic decisions. The Court ordered that Ukraine should[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors76grant this redress to the claimants of the Ivanov case and to all pending applicants complaining solelyabout prolonged non-enforcement and lack of effective remedies in respect to such non-enforcement. TheCourt adjourned all pending cases for one year, and agreed to resume the examination of all similarapplications in case Ukraine failed to adopt these remedial measures. The government asked for furtherextensions, submitted friendly settlement proposals and unilateral declarations, which in response theCourt granted the extension and struck out some of these cases off its list. However, after Ukraine requesteda new extension, the Court rejected resumingthe examination of Ivanov-type cases.In 2012 the Parliament of Ukraine passed new legislation on execution of judicial decisions, where theState Treasury was expected to pay the debts due under the domestic court judgments. Despite this newremedy, the influx of cases increased. In the meantime, the Court awarded fixed-rate amounts to coverdamages and expenses in most Ivanov-type cases. The Court acknowledged in Burmych that whilst thecase involved five applicants arguing a violation of arts 6(1) (right to a fair trial) and 13 (right to aneffective remedy) and art.1 of the Protocol No.1 (right to peaceful enjoyment of property), they weresimilar to other 12,143 pending applications against the same national jurisdiction. The government arguedthat the non-enforcement of domestic judgments was a problem that continued to exist because of the sizeof debt accumulated and the limited funding allocated for enforcing outstanding judgments. It also contendedthat there was no additional legal issue to be considered that the Ivanov case had not already decided. Italso defended itself by acknowledging different reform attempts that would show Ukraine’s commitmentto resolve the situation.Held(1) The Court decided to join the five applications with 12,143 pending applications given theirsimilar factual and legal background (by 10 votes to seven).(2) The Court declared all five applications admissible (by majority).(3) The five applications and the 12,143 joined applications were held to be dealt with incompliance with the obligation deriving from the Ivanov pilot judgment (by 13 votes tofour).In Ivanov, the Court considered the prolonged non-enforcement of domestic decisions inUkraine, identifying the systemic shortcomings, the subsequent violation of the Conventiondue to those shortcomings, and it provided guidance to the respondent state about generalmeasures it needed to introduce for relieving all victims. Thesemeasures include the provisionof redress for the non-enforcement or delayed enforcement of domestic decisions and paymentof the judgment debt.(4) The Court decided to strike all the aforementioned applications out of the Court’s list ofcases and transmit them to the Committee of Ministers to be dealt with by the latter inaccordance with the execution measures of the Ivanov pilot judgment. The Court consideredthat it was in the best interests of applicants and victims to protect them in the executionprocess rather than continuing examining post-Ivanov cases. This conclusion is withoutprejudice of the residual power vested in the Court to restore any present or similar applicationto the list of cases if justified by the circumstances.Cases consideredAirey v Ireland (1979–80) 2 E.H.R.R. 305Ananyev v Russia (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 18Anastasov v Slovenia (App. No.65020/13), judgment of 18 October 2016Case and Comment 77[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsBelanova v Ukraine (App. No.1093/02), judgment of 29 November 2005Bouyid v Belgium (2016) 62 E.H.R.R. 32Broniowski v Poland (2006) 43 E.H.R.R. 1EG v Poland and 175 Other Bug River applications v Poland (App. No.50425/99), judgment of 23September 2008Finger v Bulgaria (2017) 64 E.H.R.R. 9Greens and MT v United Kingdom (2011) 53 E.H.R.R. 21Hutten-Czapska v Poland (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 15Ivanov v Ukraine (App. No.40450/04), judgment of 15 October 2009Kudła v Poland (2000) 35 E.H.R.R. 198Kucherenko v Ukraine (App. No.27347/02), judgment 15 December 2005Oneryildiz v Turkey (2005) 41 E.H.R.R. 20Poltorachenko v Ukraine (App. No.77317/01), judgment 18 January 2005Romashov v Ukraine (App. No.67534/01), judgment of 27 July 2004Scoppola v Italy (2010) 51 E.H.R.R. 12Shmalko v Ukraine (App. No.60750/00), judgment of 20 July 2004Varga v Hungary (2015) 61 E.H.R.R. 30Voytenko v Ukraine (App. No. 18966/02), judgment of 29 June 2004Zubko v Ukraine (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 28CommentaryThe case of Burmych is a watershed ruling for pilot judgments and follow-up cases as it reshapes thejurisdictional role of the Court and empowers the Committee of Ministers to address issues ofimplementation of pilot rulings.According to the Court, the rationale of pilot judgments consists of requiring the respondent state toeliminate the source of the violation for the future and to provide remedy for any past prejudice, whichincludes all victims of the same type of violation.When a respondent state introduces amending legislationthat provides the said relief, the Court usually strikes out of its list those cases that would be resolvedthrough the new domestic legislation. Nonetheless, the “wholesale delivery of rulings” that has happenedin the interval between Ivanov and Burmych has not had a relevant impact on the overall systemic problemnor shown any progress regarding the execution process. It has only increased the Court workload asapplicants pursue obtaining financial relief from the Court’s application of art.41. The Court redefines itsrole in follow-up cases of pilot judgments by arguing that it is incompatible for it to deliver case-by-casedecisions “where there was no longer any live Convention issue”. For the Court, there is no new legalissue to be discussed and adjudicated regarding Ukraine’s structural problem of non-enforcement ofjudicial rulings. The responsibility for affording reparation with respect to pilot judgments lies on domesticjurisdictions, whereas for the Court it is only an accessory function. Instead, what follow-up cases to theIvanov judgment keep showing up is a problem of enforcement, a matter where the Committee ofMinistersseems to be better prepared for dealing with. The Court, then, went on to consider that to keep admittingsimilar applications will go against the Court’s role as a guarantor of human rights in other cases as itsworkload to judge these cases is impeding it from resolving new and pending applications.The Court retorts to a consequentialist argument for changing the current approach to pilot judgments,as it perceives that claimants turn to the Court for redress which could make the Court part of the Ukrainianlegal enforcement system, substituting itself for the domestic authorities. According to the subsidiarityprinciple, findings of facts or calculation of monetary compensation in these cases should be the domainof domestic jurisdictions in principle. To continue with the existing approach to follow-up cases wouldbecome incompatible with the subsidiarity role of the Court as defined by the Convention. Within this78 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsnew interpretation, the Court delineates the system’s shared responsibilities with other authorities. TheCourt may assist the respondent state in fulfilling its obligations by seeking to indicate the type of measureneeded to end a systemic problem. The Committee ofMinisters, on the other hand, supervises the executionand ensures that the state has discharged its obligation. The execution of the Ivanov case and follow-upcases is a problem that must be solved by the respondent state and the Committee ofMinisters. The overallfunctioning of the Convention system favours this new approach. The purposes of granting relief withinthe framework of execution proceedings would be to place all victims of the systemic violation ofnon-enforcement on an equal footing.However, the judgment was not without strong dissent, announced by the tight voting. Indeed, JudgesYudkivska, Sajó, Bianku, Karakaş, De Gaetano, Laffranque and Motoc had strong words against this newapproach. The dissenting opinion argues that the decision had nothing to do with protecting human rightsbut rather was a matter of judicial policy, aimed towards reducing the Court’s case load. Between Ivanovand Burmych the Court has examined and disposed 14,403 Ivanov-type cases, a practice which questionsthe soundness of the current decision to strike out a similar number of cases without assessing theirindividual features. This decision would be also dangerous for the future because what the Court has statedin this case is that individuals affected by these situations must be treated as victims even before submittingtheir applications, which could be admissible, ill-founded or constitute abusive litigation. Thus, thedissenters consider that the Court still needed to undertake an individual and autonomous legal determinationto decide whether the pilot judgment should be followed regarding future applications. With respect tothe division of responsibilities between the Court, the Committee of Ministers and the respondent state,the dissenters contend that the latter two (as well as the applicants) were not consulted nor informed aboutthe transfer of cases and undecided applications. This would contradict previous practice when adoptingjudicial policies, consisting of inviting stakeholders to discuss them. For dissenters the main issuesurrounding the Convention’s division of competence of empowering the Committee of Ministers wouldbe a retrograde decision, as the latter incumbent becomes the sole authority to decide if there is a violationand if there proceeds just satisfaction, conflicting with the changes introduced in 1998 which suppressedthe Committee’s intervention from judicial functions. Finally, the disagreement extends to the absorptionof victims’ individual claims into the process of execution. For the dissenting opinion this is a threat toindividual fundamental rights, as the Court would deal only with novel claims while similar applicationswould have to “‘enjoy’ the judgment given in favour of their precursors”. An example of this problemrelates to the issue of inflation affecting the fixed amount for compensation decided in Ivanov, againstwhich applicants have argued it does not cover long-term losses.In sum, this case reflects rival conceptions of the roles of the judicial function in the context of masslitigation within the Convention’s system. While the decision assumes a minimalist role for the court,drawing a clear line between execution, adjudication and reinterpreting the principle of subsidiarity tolimit its intervention, the dissenters’ opinion can be read as advocating for a more active role for judicialintervention for the Court.Monitoring workplace communicationsWorkplace correspondence—monitoring—internet usage—private life—privacy—art.8Electronic communications; Employee monitoring; Employees’ rights; Employers’ powers and duties;Right to respect for private and family life; Romania; Unfair dismissalCase and Comment 79[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsBãrbulescu v Romania (Application No.61496/08)European Court of Human Rights (Grand Chamber): Judgment of 5 September 2017FactsThe present case concerns the extent to and circumstances under which an employer is able to monitortheir employee’s communications in the workplace.

As part of his employment the applicant was asked to set up a Yahoo messenger account tocommunicate with the company’s clients. On 3 July 2007 the Bucharest office received and circulatedamongst the staff a notification highlighting the prohibition on the personal use of company equipment.The notice informed employees that their usage of the internet would be monitored, however, it did notinform employees that the content of messages sent from company computers could be monitored. On 13July 2007 the applicant was asked to attend a meeting by his employer. At this meeting the applicant wasquestioned as to why his usage of the Yahoomessenger service was higher than that of the other employeesandwhether the increased usage was due to using the service for personal purposes. The applicant contendedthat he had only ever used the service for company business. Later that day the applicant was summonedto another meeting and provided with a transcript of messages sent from his company account. Thesecontained correspondence between him, his brother and his fiancée.As a result, the applicant’s employment was terminated on the basis that the personal correspondencebreached the company’s internal regulations. The applicant brought the matter before Bucharest CountyCourt, relying on Copland v United Kingdom (2007) 45 E.H.R.R. 37, and he contended that his right to“private life” and “correspondence” under art.8 of the European Convention of Human Rights had beenviolated. On 7 December 2007 the court found the employer had complied with the Romanian LabourCode and dismissed the claim. The applicant appealed to the Bucharest Court of Appeal arguing the samegrounds. Citing EUDirective 95/46/EC, the Court of Appeal rejected the appeal opining that the employer’sactions were reasonable and were needed in order to ascertain whether the applicant had been usingcompany software for personal purposes. Consequentially, the claimant filed a complaint with the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights claiming, inter alia, that the termination of his contract combined with the dismissalof the matter before the domestic courts had breached his art.8 rights to respect for his private life andcorrespondence.Held(1) The Grand Chamber agreed with the Chamber (Bãrbulescu v Romania (App. No.61496/08),judgment of 12 January 2016) noting that art.8 was applicable in the present case. Theyopined that “private life” is a broad term under the Convention, not capable of exhaustivedefinition, and that it should not be confined to a restrictive interpretation. Further the Courtreasoned that the notion of “private life” may also include elements of professional conductand the mere fact an activity is carried out in the workplace does not preclude it from beingincluded within the remit of art.8. Turning to the issue of correspondence the Court notedthat “correspondence” is not qualified by any adjective within the Convention, as in the caseof “private life”. Accordingly, any form of correspondence had the ability to fall with theart.8 criteria and explicit note was made of the Court’s previous jurisprudence which haddealt with a variety of communication forms carried out in the workplace, all of which wereheld to concern art.8 of the Convention.(2) There had been a violation of art.8 (11 votes to six).80 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe Court agreed with the domestic courts in that the present case was essentially concernedwith a balancing exercise between the applicant’s art.8 right and the employer’s right toengage in the monitoring of electronic communication so as to ensure the smooth runningof the company. The Court began by discussing whether, given that the complaint relatedto a private company, there was a negative or positive obligation upon the state to preventbreaches of art.8 arising out of the monitoring of electronic communications. The Courtheld that as the decision was accepted by the national authorities in accordance with theRomanian Labour Code, the case should be assessed from the standpoint of the MemberState’s positive obligations. However, the Court recognised that in the context of labour lawthere was little to no consensus amongst Member States or indeed amongst comparativeorganisations, such as the EU, as to whether a state should enact specific legislation to dealwith matters of the sort concerned. Accordingly, the Court afforded Romania a wide, althoughnot unlimited, margin of appreciation, emphasising the need for adequate safeguards againstabuse of electronic communication in the workplace. The Court then listed factors which itconsidered to be relevant to the question of effective implementation of adequate safeguards.Found in full at [121] these factors included:• Whether the employee had been notified as to the possibility of their communicationsbeing monitored.• The extent to which the communications were being monitored and the degree ofcorrelating intrusion upon the employee’s private life. In this factor the Court drewa distinction between monitoring the quantity and monitoring the content ofcommunication as the latter would entail a larger intrusion into the employee’sprivacy.• Whether the employer had provided legitimate reasons for monitoring theemployee’s correspondence and whether a less intrusive method could have beenused.• Whether the employee was aware of the consequences of using company equipmentfor personal purposes• Whether adequate safeguards had been put in place for monitoring communications.Again, highlighting that the monitoring of the content of communications was moreintrusive in nature and the Court expressed a preference that any safeguards shouldprevent the monitoring of the content of the messages.• Finally, that an employee who had been subject to such monitoring should have aremedy before the domestic courts who should be in a position to determine howthe above criteria had been observed in practice.In assessing the extent to which the national courts applied the above criteria the Courtaccepted that the applicant had been made aware that the employer had the capability tomonitor electronic communication. However, the Court also noted that the domestic courtshad failed in their duty to ascertain whether the applicant was aware of the scope and natureof the monitoring measures and, in particular, whether the applicant was aware that themessage content could be monitored. Further, the Court observed that the domestic courthad failed to identify whether there were legitimate reasons for monitoring the applicant’smessage content and whether a less intrusive method could have been utilised. Accordingly,the Court found that reading the facts of the case in light of the above-mentioned criteriathe domestic courts had failed to adequately balance the two sets of rights thus leading to abreach of the applicant’s art.8 right.Case and Comment 81[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCases consideredAmann v Switzerland (2000) 29 E.H.R.R. 843Axel Springer AG v Germany (App. No.39954/08), judgment of 7 February 2012Bigaeva v Greece (App, No.26713/05), judgment of 28 May 2009Goodwin v United Kingdom (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 447Copland v United Kingdom (2007) 45 E.H.R.R. 37Fernández Martínez v Spain (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 3Hämäläinen v Finland (App. No.37359/09), judgment of 16 July 2014Köpke v Germany (App. No.420/07), judgment of 5 October 2010Niemietz v Germany (1993) 16 E.H.R.R. 97Volkov v Ukraine (2013) 57 E.H.R.R. 1Özpýnar v Turkey (App. No.20999/04), judgment of 19 October 2010Palomo Sánchez v Spain (2012) 54 E.H.R.R 24Pretty v United Kingdom (2002) 35 E.H.R.R 1Sidabras v Lithuania (2006) 42 E.H.R.R 104Söderman v Sweden (2014) 58 E.H.R.R 36Von Hannover v Germany (No.2) (App. Nos 40660/08 and 60641/08), judgment of 7 February 2012X v Netherlands (1986) 8 E.H.R.R 235Zakharov v Russia (App. No.47143/06), judgment of 4 December 2015CommentaryThe case should be heralded as a resounding victory for an employee’s right to privacy within the workplaceowing to the overturning of the Chamber’s decision. The judgment provides a helpful base from whichclarity of the law may be achieved. Whilst it is true that, as a result of the Grand Chamber’s judgment, anemployee can expect to be afforded more privacy in a workplace environment, the Court was very clearin that monitoring of correspondence is a two-way balancing exercise which naturally entails a loss anda gain on both sides. The relevant factors for consideration provided by the Court at [121] form thesubstantive basis of what must be considered in order to for an employer, or in the alternative a domesticcourt, to adequately balance these competing interests.Through a close case reading, the primary concern of the Court is the degree of knowledge which theemployee is afforded. This is evidenced by the Court repeatedly mentioning that the applicant was notaware that the content of his communications could be monitored. Accordingly, an employer is still ableto monitor their employee’s correspondence, provided they have a reason to do so, if they have informedthe employee beforehand and ensured that employees are made aware of the consequences of usingcompany services for personal purposes. Unfortunately, combined with the inherently unequal powerdynamic between employers and employees it is questionable how much protection this judgment willactually afford employees in practice and whether employees will simply be forced to accept intrusivemonitoring methods by mere virtue of being aware of them.Of interest are the two grounds of dissent expressed in the joint opinion of Judges Raimondi, Dedov,Kjølbro, Mits, Mouro-Vikstöm and Eicke. First, issue was drawn with the majority opinion that thedomestic employment court had erred with regard to its application of the law. The dissenting opinioncontended that in the context of positive rights, Contracting States are only required to provide an adequate“legal framework” which allows for protection of the Convention rights and held that Romania providedsuch a framework yet it was simply not utilised by the applicant. Accordingly, they expressed concernwith the majority view focusing solely on the application of the law by the domestic court as opposed tothe failure, on the part of the applicant, to exhaust all the domestic remedies available to him, thereby82 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsmaking it appear as though an adequate legal framework was absent. Second, the dissenting judgesdisagreed with how the majority assessed the analysis carried out by the domestic court. Primarily, theyfelt that the domestic courts were right in giving precedence to the employer’s right to the smooth runningof a company. Through emphasising the wide margin of appreciation enjoyed by Contracting States inthis field, which is enhanced by lack of a European consensus on the matter, they felt that the domesticcourts did strike a fair balance between the two competing rights. Crucial in this regard was their opinionthat without the ability to monitor communications of employees such a right would be unattainable.Finally, the dissenting judges felt that provided the employee was aware that at least one aspect of hiscommunications could be monitored it was immaterial whether he was expressly made aware that thecontent of those communications could be monitored as well.Ultimately, the judgment will require companies to reconsider their monitoring procedures but will notdrastically inhibit their implementation provided the employee is kept appraised of the situation and extentof the procedure.National security and the right to a fair trialSecurity clearance—withholding of information—national security—defence—right to a fair trial—art.6Czech Republic; Margin of appreciation; National security; National security certificates;Non-disclosure; Right to fair and public hearingRegner v Czech Republic (Application No.35289/11)European Court of Human Rights (Grand Chamber): Judgment of 19 September 2017FactsMr Václav Regner (the applicant), born in 1962, is a Czech national living in Prague. He was employedby the Ministry of Defence following a contract signed on 2 November 2004. In order to grant access to“secret” classified information, which would allow him to fulfil the duties in his role, security clearancewas required, which the Ministry of Defence requested on 27 December 2004. Clearance was approvedon 19 July 2005 and was valid for five years. However, this was retracted on 5 September 2006. It cameto light that, when applying for security clearance, Mr Regner had failed to disclose information regardinghis foreign bank accounts and the company directorships he held. The second reason for withdrawal ofsecurity clearance was that on 7 October 2005, the National Security Authority (NSA) received confidentialintelligence, classified in the “restricted” category, that the applicant was perceived as a threat to nationalsecurity. In order to verify the information they had received, NSA began an investigation, which promptedfurther intelligence, dated 21 March 2006, also classified as “restricted”. The reasons behind deeming MrRegner as untrustworthy were confidential and therefore, legally, it was not information that could beshared with the applicant. Following the applicant’s request owing to health reasons, he was removedfrom office on 4 October 2006 and, on 20 October 2006, signed a mutual agreement to end his contract,with termination taking effect on 31 January 2007.In January 2007, Mr Regner sought judicial review for the withdrawal of his security clearance. PragueMunicipal Court dismissed his application on the basis that in cases of national security, reasons couldonly be disclosed if they related to non-classified documents; thus, it was illegal to disclose the detailspertaining to the applicant’s case. In July 2010, the Supreme Administrative Court also dismissed MrRegner’s appeal because they found that revealing the classified information to the applicant would resultCase and Comment 83[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsin an exposure of the NSA’s methods. The applicant then filed a complaint to the Constitutional Court,with the view that the proceedings were unfair. In March 2011, the prosecution charged Mr Regner withinfluencing the awarding of public contracts at the Ministry between 2005 and 2007. The Regional Courtsentenced him to three years’ imprisonment; the Prague High Court upheld this judgment, but with asuspended sentence of two years.Held(1) The application was considered to be admissible because the case discussed a civil rightwithin art.6. and whether this right was violated.(2) The Court found there was no violation of art.6 (10 votes to seven).Mr Regner’s right to a fair trial had not been infringed upon in the refusal to discloseconfidential NSA intelligence as to why he was viewed as no longer able to keep secrets.The judgment considers that the security clearance required for Mr Regner to act in his rolewas a prerequisite for accessing sensitive state information, but also needed for performingcertain roles in civil service. The Court found that access to such information is thereforenot a civil right for the purpose of art.6. In reference to previous case law, the Court concludedthat in cases such as this, where conflicting interests are involved, public interest is whatshould surpass procedural rights of the individual. Despite “restricted” information beingwithheld from the applicant, all informationwasmade available to Czech courts, and domesticdecisions and proceedings were believed to have been conducted fairly. The constraintsplaced onMr Regner’s rights were compensated by the courts’ powers to view all documentsassociated with the case. His right to a fair trial was not lessened.Cases consideredAl-Adsani v United Kingdom (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 11Al-Dulimi and Montana Management Inc v Switzerland (App. No.5809/08), judgment of 21 June2016Ankarcrona v Sweden (App. No.35178/97), judgment of 27 June 2000Avotiņš v Latvia (2017) 64 E.H.R.R. 2Blečić v Croatia (2006) 43 E.H.R.R. 48Boulois v Luxembourg (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 32Chahal v United Kingdom (1997) 23 E.H.R.R. 413Cudak v Lithuania (2010) 51 E.H.R.R. 15Devenney v United Kingdom (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 24Ellès v Switzerland (App. No.12573/06), judgment of 16 December 2010Fayed v United Kingdom (1994) 18 E.H.R.R. 393Fitt v United Kingdom (2000) 30 E.H.R.R. 480Masson v Netherlands (1996) 22 E.H.R.R. 491Mats Jacobsson v Sweden (1990) 13 E.H.R.R. 79Obermeier v Austria (1990) 13 E.H.R.R. 290Ohneberg v Austria (App. No.10781/08), judgment of 18 September 2012Olujić v Croatia (App. No. 22330/05), judgment of 5 February 2009Pocius v Lithuania (App. No.35601/04), judgment of 6 July 2010Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein v Germany (App. No.42527/98), judgment of 12 July 2001Pudas v Sweden (1987) 10 E.H.R.R. 380Roche v United Kingdom (2005) 42 E.H.R.R. 60084 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsTinnelly & Sons Ltd v United Kingdom (1999) 27 E.H.R.R. 249Van Marle v Netherlands (1986) 8 E.H.R.R. 483Vilho Eskelinen v Finland (2007) 45 E.H.R.R. 43Vučković v Serbia (2014) 59 E.H.R.R. 19CommentaryThe difficulty of this case rests within the laws that govern the administrative decision to revoke securityclearance. Clearance was required to perform the applicant's particular duties, but this access to classifiedinformation is not a civil right. Of course, the judgment relies on the argument that the Czech courts wereprivy to the confidential documents containing the “restricted” information regarding the applicant. Thecase clearly created a significant divide in the Grand Chamber, seen in the sheer volume of opinionsannexed to the judgment. Of particular interest, the joint partly dissenting opinion of Judges Raimondi,Cicilianos, Spano, Ravarani and Pastor Vilanova expressed that art.6 had actually been breached. Theyvoiced how inconceivable it was for NSA to withhold information on the grounds that it would exposetheir methods. Perhaps, however, the intelligence they received was the result of an informant or somebodyMr Regner may have trusted and unveiling this would have caused detrimental consequences. But, moresubstantially, they were troubled that, from a legal point of view, failure to disclose on why the applicantwas a risk to security, guaranteed that the process of building a defence would be impossible. It is, ofcourse, problematic to speculate why Mr Regner wished to terminate his employment, and indeed thecourts did not study this fact in much depth. It was the applicant’s specific role, as deputy to theVice-Minister of Defence, which was affected by the revoking of security clearance, not his employmentas a whole. As Judge Wojtyczek’s concurring opinion and Judges Guerra’s and Trajkovska’s joint partlydissenting opinion both emphasise, it is important to note it was the applicant’s mutual decision to resign.The controversy of the case can be further explored in Judge Sajó’s dissenting opinion, which highlightsthe significance of the applicant’s lack of knowledge on himself concerning the case against him. As aresult of this denial of details about information, which was classified as “restricted”, Mr Regner and hislawyer were also deprived of the possibility of constructing a full defence. The question of equality ofarms is raised here—a fundamental principle the right to a fair trial encompasses. With this principledenied to him through a failure to completely disclose elements of information brought against him, MrRegner was placed in a disadvantaged position, where he categorically could not raise an effective defence.So, for the Court it may seem that threats to national security can limit, to some extent, the right to a fairtrial.Corrective reply articles and freedom of expressionJournalist—editorial—corrective reply—no hearing—art.6—right of others—freedom of expression—art.10—TurkeyDefamatory statements; Freedom of expression; Journalists; Right of reply; Right to fair and publichearing; Right to fair trial; TurkeyEker v Turkey (Application No.24016/05)European Court of Human Rights (Second Section): Judgment of 24 October 2017Case and Comment 85[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsFactsThe applicant, Mustafa Eker, resides in Sinop, Turkey, and was, at the material time, editor of BizimKaradeniz, a local newspaper. On 23 February 2005, Mr Eker published an editorial entitled “May yourroute be smooth” in which he sharply criticised the journalists’ association of Sinop, accusing them ofacting in contradiction with their main objective and of not serving their intended purpose. On 25 February2005, the president of the association, considering that Eker’s editorial had undermined his and hisassociates’ dignity and honour sent Mr Eker a corrective reply for publication. The latter refused to publishthe reply in the local newspaper.At the beginning of March 2005, the president of the journalists’ association applied to the SinopMagistrate’s Court aiming to obtain an order of publication for his corrective reply. The court ordered thepublication without holding a hearing and ruled only on the basis of the case file. Mr Eker appealed theorder before the Sinop Criminal Court which, also on the basis of the case file, dismissed the appeal. Thecriminal court’s decision was the final ruling, and the reply was consequently printed in the concernedlocal newspaper.Mr Eker complained that his right to a fair trial (art.6), his right to respect for private and family life(art.8), and his right to an effective remedy (art.13) had been breached because there had been no hearingseither before the magistrate or the criminal courts, because the examination of the case by the latter hadbeen insufficient, and because he had had no opportunity to refer his case to a higher jurisdiction.Moreover,the applicant considered that his freedom of expression (art.10) had been undermined since he had beenobliged to publish the reply.Held(1) The Court declared the application admissible concerning art.6(1) in relation to the lack ofa hearing before the domestic courts and art.10 of the Convention, and declared the remainderof the application inadmissible (unanimous).(2) There had been no violation of art.6(1) in relation to the lack of a hearing before the domesticcourts (unanimous).First, concerning the lack of a hearing before the two domestic courts, the Court reiteratedthat the obligation to hold a hearing is not absolute. Exceptional circumstances might justifythe lack of a hearing. Under art.6(1), all procedures do not necessarily require an oral hearing.This is notably the case for issues that do not raise questions of credibility or do not causecontroversy over the facts of the case. Other considerations, such as the right to a judgmentwithin a reasonable period, are considered to determine whether a hearing is necessary. Inthe present case, the Court noted that the questions at stake required a textual and technicalanalysis on the corrective reply and that no hearing was necessary for the domestic courtsto decide on the issue. Moreover, the “right to reply” procedure, as provided for by Turkishlaw, constitutes an exceptional and urgent procedure. The promptness of the decision isconsequently essential for the effectiveness of the procedure. As a result, the Court consideredthat art.6(1) had not been breached in the present case.Concerning the remaining claims made by the applicant in relation to an insufficientexamination of the case by the domestic courts and the absence of a possibility to appeal toa higher court, the Court considered they were manifestly ill-founded.(3) There had been no violation of art.10 (unanimous).The Court considered that the publication of the corrective reply was related to the exerciseby the journalists’ association of their freedom of expression. However, the Court also agreedthat the obligation the applicant had to publish the reply could be considered as an interference86 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorswith his freedom of expression. The Court firstly noted that the interference was providedfor by the Turkish law, namely in art.32 of the Constitution and art.14 of the Press Act, andthat the latter pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation and rights of others.Secondly, the interference, according to the Court, was necessary in a democratic society.Indeed, the right of reply guarantees the pluralism of information. Thirdly, in the presentcase, the Court noted that the domestic courts had struck a fair balance between the applicant’sfreedom of expression and the association’s right to protect their reputation. Finally, theCourt observed that the obligation to publish the corrective reply was proportionate to theaim pursued since the applicant had not been compelled to modify the content of his editorial,but only to publish a reply to the latter. Moreover, the applicant was completely free topublish a new editorial to re-explain his version of the facts.Cases consideredDiennet v France (1996) 21 E.H.R.R. 554Döry v Sweden (App. No.28394/95), judgment of 12 November 2002Göç v Turkey (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 6Håkansson v Sweden (1990) 13 E.H.R.R. 1Jurisic and Collegium Mehrerau v Austria (App. No.62539/00), judgment of 27 July 2006Kaperzyński v Poland (App. No.43206/07), judgment of 3 April 2012Martinie v France [GC] (App. No.58675/00), judgment of 12 April 2006Melnitchouk v Ukraine (App. No.28743/03), judgment of 5 July 2005Morice v France (2016) 62 E.H.R.R. 1Varela Assalino v Portugal (App. No.43369/01), judgment of 25 April 2002CommentaryIn the present case, the Court had to render a decision on two major rights of the Convention, namely theright to a fair trial and the freedom of expression. Concerning art.6(1), the Court reiterated that, while theConvention states that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing, the obligation to hold a publichearing is not absolute. Here, the domestic courts had first to decide whether the honour and dignity ofthe association had been undermined by the editorial which, if it was the case, would give rise to a rightof reply. Once this right had been recognised, the domestic courts had to proceed to a textual analysis ofthe reply’s content to make sure the latter did not itself undermine the right of others. The Court consideredthat these questions did not necessitate a debate on evidence or the cross-examination of witnesses.Moreover, the procedure was an exceptional urgent procedure that did not prevent the eventual initiationof a defamation action where adversarial debates would take place. In relation to art.10, the Court madeclear that, while the applicant shall have his freedom of expression protected, so did the leaders of theassociation. The right of reply is an important element of the freedom of expression: it ensures the pluralityof opinion and enables the contestation of false information. As a result, while the obligation for theapplicant to publish the corrective reply constituted an interference with his freedom of expression, thelatter was necessary to guarantee the pluralism of information which is fundamental in a democraticsociety. The judgment of the Court is a notable effort to uphold the right to freedom of expression inTurkey, at a time that journalists’ rights have been severely restricted by the Erdogan government.Case and Comment 87[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsConscientious objection to compulsory military serviceConscientious objector—compulsory military service—alternatives—civilian nature—deterrent or punitivecharacter—art.9—freedom of thought, conscience and religionArmenia; Conscientious objection; Conscription; Freedom of thought conscience and religion;Marginof appreciationAdyan v Armenia (Application No.75604/11)European Court of Human Rights (First section): Judgment of 12 October 2017FactsThe four applicants,Mr Adyan,Mr Avetisyan,Mr Khachatryan andMrMargaryan, are Armenian nationalsand Jehovah’s Witnesses who refused to participate in state-mandated military or alternative service onthe grounds that it conflicted with their religious beliefs. The applicants argued that the alternative serviceoffered in Armenia was not genuinely civilian in nature because it remained under the control andsupervision of the military authorities. All of the applicants had criminal proceedings brought againstthem for the evasion of conscription to military or alternative service in accordance with the ArmenianCriminal Code. The first, third and fourth applicants were further detained and had appeals against theirdetention orders dismissed by the Criminal Court of Appeal in 2011, which cited the probability of themcommitting a new offence or evading punishment if they were released.Lodging a complaint before the Court, the applicants alleged a violation of their art.9 right to freedomof thought, conscience and religion on the grounds that the alternative service was not civilian in natureand it was against their conscience to participate. In support of their argument, the applicants cited thereforms implemented in Armenia in 2013 to remove the alternative service scheme from military controland provide for the release of conscientious objectors detained in accordance with Council of Europerecommendations. The first, third and fourth applicants brought a further complaint in accordance withtheir art.5 right to liberty alleging that the domestic courts had not provided relevant and sufficient reasonsfor their detention.Held(1) The respondent government’s objection based upon the non-exhaustion of domestic remedieswas joined to the merits and rejected (unanimous).It was argued by the Armenian government that the legal amendments applied to the CriminalCode Implementation Act inMay 2013 providing for the release of persons serving sentencesfor evasion of military service, the expunging of their criminal records, and the correspondingreduction of their terms of service, provided the applicants with an opportunity to obtainredress at the domestic level of which they did not avail themselves. The applicants in turnargued that these amendments failed to adequately provide for rehabilitation or compensation.The Court held that this question was closely linked to the substance of the complaint andshould therefore be joined to the merits.(2) The art.9 and art.5 claims of the applicants were declared admissible (unanimous).88 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe Court of its own motion addressed the question of admissibility of the art.9 claim andnoted that art.9 is applicable where opposition to military service is founded upon “a seriousand insurmountable conflict” between the conscience or genuinely held religious beliefs ofthe person obliged to serve and the service. It was noted that the Court had no reason todoubt this was the case on the facts presented. The claim was held not to be manifestlyill-founded and was declared admissible.(3) There had been a violation of the applicants’ art.9 right to freedom of thought, conscienceand religion (unanimous).The Court underlined the contradictory nature of the respondent government’s claims inrelation to the existence of a legitimate interference with art.9 and held that there had clearlybeen an interference with the applicants’ right in their conviction for refusing to performmilitary service on religious grounds in accordance with its decision in Bayatyan v Armenia(App. No.23459/03, judgment of 7 July 2011).The simple fact of offering an alternative in the form of “alternative labour service” providedfor by the Armenian Alternative Service Act, in and of itself, was insufficient to satisfy thestate’s art. 9 obligations. The margin of appreciation enjoyed by the States Parties in theorganisation of alternatives to military service was held to find its limit in the requirementthat any alternative offered must, both in law and in practice, be a service of a genuinelycivilian nature and not have a deterrent or punitive character. On the current facts, the Courtheld that it was not in dispute that the work itself was civilian in nature, however, the otherfactors to be taken into account, namely those of authority, control, applicable rules andappearances, pointed to the Armenian labour service being insufficiently separate from themilitary system. In particular, the Court pointed out that the relevant military authoritieswere involved in supervising the alternative labour service, that they held the power to orderthe transfer of the serviceman, and that the Internal Rules of Service in the Armed Forceswere applied.On the question of the deterrent or punitive nature of the alternative service, the Courtexamined the duration of the service which was sufficiently longer than one-and-a-half timesthe length of the military service limit provided by Council of Europe recommendations,leading to a deterrent and punitive effect. In light of these findings and in combination withthe acknowledgement by the respondent government of the shortcomings of the alternativeservice scheme, which had given rise to reports and reforms, the Court concluded that theappropriate allowances had not been made for the conscience and beliefs of the applicants.The non-exhaustion of domestic remedies objection was rejected on the grounds that thedomestic reforms implemented, along with the corresponding case-law of the Court ofCassation, had not been presented as offering an exploration of the potential violation of theapplicants’ art.9 rights or any resulting non-pecuniary damages. It was concluded, furtherunderlining the requirement the applicants perform alternative service in the place of theremainder of their sentences, that no adequate remedy had been offered at the domestic leveland that there had been a clear violation of art.9.(4) The alleged violation of art.5 based upon the failure of the domestic courts to provide relevantand sufficient reasons for the detention of three of the applicants was held not to require aseparate ruling in light of the Court’s findings on art.9 (unanimous).(5) The respondent state was ordered to pay the applicants €12,000 each in non-pecuniarydamages within three months, with simple interest payable thereafter (unanimous).(6) The Court rejected the remainder of the applicants’ claim for just satisfaction and legal costs(unanimous).Case and Comment 89[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCases consideredBayatyan v Armenia (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 15Buscarini v San Marino (2000) 30 E.H.R.R. 208Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v Romania (App. No.47848/08), judgmentof 17 July 2014Erçep v Turkey (App. No.43965/04), judgment of 22 November 2011Hasan v Bulgaria (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 55Dogan v Turkey (2017) 64 E.H.R.R. 5Kamil Uzun v Turkey (App. No.37410/97), judgment of 10 May 2007Sahin v Turkey (2007) 44 E.H.R.R. 5Papavasilakis v Greece (App. No.66899/14), judgment of 15 September 2015Savda v Turkey (App. No.42730/05), judgment of 12 June 2012CommentaryThe Court in the present case took the opportunity to decisively reaffirm and clarify the principles laiddown in its previous case-law, notably in the Bayatyan v Armenia (2011) case, in which the right toconscientious objection to military service was held to be guaranteed under art.9. Making an impassioneddefence of the freedoms protected under art.9 as a “precious asset” for both individuals who are religiousbelievers and non-believers, the Court noted that they remain essential in safeguarding the pluralism of ademocratic society. The broad scope of art.9 freedom of religion based upon the line of cases delineatingthe freedom to hold, practise or manifest beliefs was recalled, before examining the conditions underwhich an interference with the art.9 right may be justified, namely where it is prescribed by law, pursuesone or more legitimate aims, and is necessary in a democratic society.The Court laid down a number of limitations on the margin of appreciation applying to States Parties’decision-making in relation to interferences with art.9 in the context of compulsory military service. First,it was recalled that where no alternative service is offered, a higher bar applies, requiring the state todemonstrate a “pressing social need” for any interference. Second, the margin of appreciation applied inrelation to the organisation of any alternative service offered was held to be limited by the requirementthat it be, in both law and practice, a service of a genuinely civilian nature, without any deterrent or punitiveeffect. Four additional factors to be taken into account by the Court in its determination on the civilian innature of an alternative service were laid down; namely, authority, control, applicable rules, and appearances.The duration of the period of service was additionally shown to be an important factor to consider indetermining whether an alternative service has a deterrent or punitive character.In this unanimous decision the Court can be seen to be taking a strong stance in defence of the rightsof conscientious objectors under art.9, restricting the margin of appreciation available to the States Partiesand calling for a clear separation between the military and civilian service options for individuals. Instriking the “fair balance” between individual conscience and the interests of society as a whole, the scaleswere reset in favour of the individuals in this case.90 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsDifferent-sex couples and registered partnershipsLegal recognition of relationship—same-sex couples—different-sex-couples—no European consensus—right to privacy—art.8—non-discrimination—art.14Austria; Civil partnerships; Discrimination; Marriage; Right to respect for private and family life;Same sex partnersRatzenböck and Seydl v Austria (Application No. 28475/12)European Court of Human Rights (Fifth Section): Judgment of 26 October 2017FactsThe applicants, two Austrian nationals Ms H Ratzenböck and Mr M Seydl, lodged an application to enterinto a registered partnership in February 2010, after living in a stable relationship for many years. Thelocal authority (the Mayor of Linz) rejected their application as it did not fulfil the legal requirementsunder the Austrian Registered Partnership Act (Eintragene Partnerschaft-Gesetz), being that ss.2 and5(1)(1) reserved registered partnerships exclusively for same-sex couples.They appealed the decision to the Regional Governor, and then the Constitutional and AdministrativeCourts, arguing that, inter alia, their arts 8 and 14 rights under the European Convention of Human Rightshad been violated by discrimination based on sex and sexual orientation. They noted that were somesubstantial differences between registered partnership and marriage which made registered partnershipmore appropriate for them, and argued that the principle set by the European Court of Human Rights inSchalk v Austria (App. No.30141/04, judgment of 22 November 2010) (that states are allowed to restrictaccess to marriage for same-sex couples) should not be applied to registered partnerships, as a moderninstitution not based in long-standing tradition of discrimination.All appeals by the applicants were dismissed. The Constitutional Court expressed that, in its view,different-sex couples do not have a right to enter into registered partnership under art.12 of the Convention,and that in accordance with Schalk, art.14 cannot impose an obligation to grant this right to different-sexcouples. The Constitutional Court noted that registered partnerships were introduced to counterdiscrimination against same-sex couples by providing themwith an alternative framework for recognitionand legal rights traditionally associatedwithmarriage. Their analysis of art.14 noted amargin of appreciationafforded to states in granting access to the different institutions, given the lack of European consensus onthematter. The Constitutional Court did not examinewhether the substantive differences were in compliancewith the principle of equality.Held(1) The Court held the application admissible (unanimous).The Austrian government contested the victim status on the basis that the differences inlegal consequences of registered partnership and marriage were purely hypothetical futureeffects on the applicants. The Court dismissed this argument, agreeing with the applicantsthat the situation with which they were concerned was access to a registered partnership,and that the applicants had a legitimate personal interest in addressing this situation.Case and Comment 91[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors(2) The Court held that there was no violation of art.14 taken in conjunction with art.8 (fivevotes to two).The Court held that the legal nature of a “familial” relationship, even where the couple areoutside of wedlock, clearly falls within the ambit of art.8, so it was applicable to analysisof art.14 in this instance. It was also confirmed that it is well established that sexualorientation is a ground for discrimination to fall under art.14.The Court noted that it had not yet had the opportunity to examine the difference in treatmentrelating to exclusion of a different-sex couple into a legal institution. They considered thatdifferent-sex couples and same-sex couples are in an analogous situation with respect totheir need for legal recognition of their relationship, and protections and benefits stemmingtherefrom. The Court held that the difference in treatment with respect to entry into registeredpartnership is, however, justifiable, given that different-sex couples are not in a similar orcomparable situation to same-sex couples, given that the former have access to marriagewhereas the latter do not.They noted that registered partnership was introduced to provide legal recognition forsame-sex couples as an alternative to marriage, fromwhich they are still excluded in Austria.Confirming the principle from Schalk that a margin of appreciation is afforded to states intheir provision of these institutions to different-sex and same-sex couples, the Court foundthat the two institutions in Austria are complementary, and there are no significant substantivedifferences between them. The result of this is that a different-sex couple have their needfor legal recognition satisfied by access to the institution of marriage, and therefore are notin a comparable situation to same-sex couples who require registered partnership as analternative legal recognition of their relationship.Cases consideredEBv France (2008) 47 E.H.R.R. 21Elsholz v Germany (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 58Fábián v Hungary (App. No.78117/13), judgment of 15 December 2015Karner v Austria (2003) 38 E.H.R.R. 528Kozak v Poland (2010) 51 E.H.R.R. 16Oliari v Italy (2017) 65 E.H.R.R. 26Petrovic v Austria (2001) 33 E.H.R.R. 14Salgueiro da Silva Mouta v Portugal (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 47Schalk v Austria (2011) 53 E.H.R.R. 20Vallianatos v Greece (2014) 59 E.H.R.R. 12X v Austria (2013) 57 E.H.R.R. 14CommentaryThere has been a growing movement towards the legalisation of gay marriage across Europe, however,the decision of the Court in Schalk made it clear that this is not yet a norm. The margin of appreciationof states to regulate entry to that institution is reaffirmed in the present case. If the Court had chosen tofollow the arguments of the applicants, finding that there was a discrimination based on same-sex anddifferent-sex couples being in a comparable situation, then this could logically lead to a finding thatmarriage could not be reserved for different-sex couples. As Judge Mits notes in his concurring opinion,despite a growing trend, there is no European consensus on this sensitive issue, and it appears that theCourt is not ready to take this step.92 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsJudges Tsotsoria and Grozev dissented on the finding that different-sex and same-sex couples are notin a comparable situation, arguing that analysis of the legal regulation of their relationships ignores theirsocial realities. They do not believe that this would invalidate Schalk, where an analogous situation forthe couples was found and that distinction in entry to marriage was a justifiable difference in treatmenton the basis of tradition. However, the majority in the present case appear to prefer, by not finding ananalogous situation, to avoid justifying a discrimination, instead attributing the difference in treatment toa difference in situation.It is noteworthy that the Court justifies its decision on the substantive legal similarities of the institutions,and that, in Austria, marriage is not open to same-sex couples. Applying this reasoning in a similar casebrought against a state, where same-sex couples are allowed to marry but different-sex couples are notpermitted civil partnership, would not hold, and therefore it is imaginable that against such a state aviolation could be found.Parental rights and temporary placement of children in careBest interests of the child—parental rights—parental obligations—care proceedings—right to respect forfamily life—art.8Care orders; Children's welfare; Parental rights; Right to respect for private and family life; RomaniaAchim v Romania (Application No.45959/11)European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section): Judgment of 24 October 2017FactsThe present case concerns two applicants of Roma ethnicity who had seven children. In September 2010,the General Directorate of Social Security and Child Protection (GDSSCP) asked the Public Service ofSocial Assistance (PSSA) to investigate the situation of the applicants’ children. The PSSA found thatthe family lived in an unsanitary house and that the applicants were not concerned with the education orthe state of health of their children. Furthermore, the family income exclusively came from a disabilitypension received by the second applicant and allowances for the children. The investigation revealed thatthe applicants refused to enrol their children in school or register them with a general practitioner. Afterestablishing a regular follow-up programme of the family, the social services reported that the house inwhich the family lived was poorly maintained and that the situation of the children did not improve.Moreover, the applicants showed reluctance to cooperate with the social services and did not comply withtheir parental obligations.In April 2011, the County Court of Călăraşi ordered the emergency placement of the children. Apsychological examination revealed that the applicants’ children suffered from several deficiencies andminor mental backwardness as a result of the applicants’ negligence. The youngest child, I, had to behospitalised. The applicants did not appeal the judgment of the County Court. In August 2011, the GDSSCPrequested before the County Court the replacement of the emergency placement by a temporary placement.The Court held that, considering that the applicants did not meet the conditions necessary for the gooddevelopment of their children, it was in the best interest of the latter to be under a temporary placementmeasure. The applicants’ appeal against the decisions was dismissed by the Court of Appeal of Bucharest,which considered that the precariousness of the living conditions of the applicants and their behaviour inCase and Comment 93[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsrespect of their children justified the temporary placement. Six of the children were placed in a care centrefor children and I was placed with a childminder.The applicants started to improve their living conditions by doing someworks in the house, and obtainingelectricity and drinking water. They made efforts to keep in contact with their children and even startedto cooperate with the social services. However, they refused to take a psychological evaluation. In February2012, the PSSA conducted a new investigation and concluded that the material living conditions of theapplicants had improved, that the parents had made the commitment to enrol the children in school andregister them with a general practitioner. Meanwhile, the applicants brought an action before the countycourt to ask for the end of the emergency placement measure of the seven children and their reintegrationinto the family. With the advice of the GDSSCP, the county court dismissed the claim. In March 2012,the Court of Appeal of Bucharest upheld the decision, considering that the improvement of the livingconditions was not the only criterion that had to be met for the children to come back home, but that otherconditions had to be satisfied to guarantee the respect for the best interest of the children.The applicants visited the children more often, called them and agreed to take an interview with apsychologist to evaluate their parental skills. In May 2012, the county court held that the conditions toensure I’s development were met and put an end to the temporary placement measure. However, the courtdismissed the action regarding the reintegration of the other children. The applicants and the GDSSCPappealed. The Court of Appeal overturned the judgment of the county court, taking into account theimprovement of the living conditions of the applicants and the change in their behaviour in respect oftheir children.The applicants brought a claim before the European Court of Human Rights against the placement ofthe children and the dismissal of their action by the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Bucharest on 20March 2012, which prevented them from reintegrating the children within their family. They argued thattheir right to respect for family life, as guaranteed by art.8 of the Convention, had been infringed.Held(1) The Court declared that the applicants did not appeal the decision ordering the emergencyplacement of the children. Thus, the first part of the complaint had to be regarded asinadmissible on the ground that the applicants had not exhausted all the domestic remedies.The second part of the complaint was held admissible.(2) There had been no violation of art.8 (unanimous).On the substance of the case, the Court recalled that the fact, for a child and a parent, to betogether constitutes a fundamental element of family life. Internal measures, such as thetemporary placement of the applicants’ children, are an interference with the right to respectfor family life. However, such an interference does not infringe art.8, if it is provided for inthe law, it pursues a legitimate aim, and it is necessary in a democratic society. The Courtinsisted on the fact that keeping a family apart is a very serious interference with the rightto respect for family life that must be based on the interest of the child. Moreover, the removalof a child from his parents must only be used as a measure of last resort. The state has apositive obligation to take every necessary step to ensure the reunification of the child andthe parent concerned. It must strike a fair balance between the competing interests of thechild, the parent, and the public order, although the best interest of the child remains adetermining consideration.In the present case, the objective of the temporary placement measure was the safeguardingof the interests of the children. The Court observed that, as soon as the social services startedto evaluate the situation of the applicants’ children, they noted material deficiencies andparental failures. The social services tried to advise the applicants regarding the measures94 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthey should take to improve the situation of the children, but the applicants showed reluctanceto cooperate. Furthermore, the reports revealed that the children suffered from mentalretardation and language disordersand anxiety. The state of health of the youngest child wasparticularly worrying. Therefore, the measure of temporary placement was not only basedon material deficiencies, but was taken in line with the interests of the children. The Courtof Appeal ordered the maintenance of the measure by looking at all the facts of the case,i.e. the material living conditions of the applicants, the evolution of the relationships betweenthe applicants and their children and the collaboration of the former with the social services.The Court of Appeal recognised that the material living conditions had improved, butconsidered that the behaviour of the applicants did not guarantee that the children would besafe upon return in their family. Thus, the motives on the ground of which the temporaryplacement measure was adopted were relevant and sufficient. The Court reminded that themeasure was temporary and that the ultimate goal was to facilitate the reunification with theparents, while respecting the best interests of the children. The social services wereparticularly concerned with the necessity to maintain the contact between the applicants andthe children. The Court considered that the local authorities had taken all the measures thatwere reasonably expected from them so that the children could be reunited with their parents.Cases consideredCouillard Maugery v France (App. No.64796/01), judgment of 1 July 2004Gherghina v Romania [GC] (App. No.42219/07), judgment of 9 July 2015Gnahoré v France (2000) 34 E.H.R.R. 38K v Finland (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 18Kutzner v Germany (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 25Maumousseau v France (2010) 51 E.H.R.R. 35Neulinger v Switzerland [GC] (2010) 54 E.H.R.R. 31RMS v Spain (App. No.28775/12), judgment of 18 June 2013Sahin v Germany [GC] (App. No.30943/96), judgment of 8 July 2003Saviny v Ukraine (2010) 51 E.H.R.R. 33Scozzari v Italy [GC] (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 12Soares de Melo v Portugal (App. No.72850/14, judgment of 16 February 2016CommentaryThe Court upheld its case-law on the right to respect for family life and reasserted the general principlesapplicable to the separation of a child from a parent. The main issue in this case was to find a fair balancebetween the competing interests of the welfare of the child and the applicants’ right to exercise theirparental obligations. The reasoning was guided by the prime consideration of the best interests of a child.Nevertheless, the Court highlighted the “extreme” character of a measure of placement, and the necessityto reunify the family as soon as the conditions favourable to the good development of the child would bemet.This case is particularly interesting in the light of the observations produced by the Committee on theRights of the Child in 2009, regarding the situation of the protection of the rights of children in Romania.The Committee expressed concern regarding the high child mortality rate, which is a consequence ofparental negligence and the poor quality of social services.

The incident took placeon 10 December 2004 when, following an altercation with a prison officer, both applicants were taken tosolitary confinement within the Asti Correctional Facility. Both applicants were stripped and put in cellswhich had a bed with no mattress, bed linen or covers. The cells had rudimentary toilets but no sinks orpanes on the windows; with one applicant having plastic covering the window and the other amalfunctioning radiator to protect against the December weather. During the course of their solitaryconfinement both applicants were given limited food, often none at all or sometimes only bread and water,and both were beaten on a daily basis. The first applicant noted being repeatedly “punched, kicked andhit in the head by prison officers, who assaulted him in groups of varying sizes”, while the second applicantwas similarly repeatedly “punched, kicked, slapped and at one point had his head pinned to the groundby one of the prison officer’s boots.”A criminal investigation into the treatment commenced in 2005 after the treatment was uncoveredthrough covert surveillance employed in an operation to investigate drug smuggling in the correctionalfacility. On 7 July 2011 five prison officers, CB, DB, MS, AD, and GS, were brought to trial, with theAsti District Court delivering its judgment on 30 January 2012. The Court established the facts with theevidence showing that the events had occurred in the manner described by the victims in their submissions.The Court found ample evidence that the prison officers had operated in a climate of impunity. In assessingthe officers’ responsibility, the Court acquitted GS, AD and DB of their charges of ill-treatment underart.572 of the Criminal Code. AD and DB, however, were found to have inflicted bodily harm on theapplicants, contrary to art.582 of the Criminal Code. However, the proceedings were discontinued due tothe expiration of the applicable time-limit as laid down in the statute of limitations. Officers CB and MSwere found to have committed acts amounting to torture as defined under the United Nations Conventionagainst Torture, though the Court noted that Italy had failed to incorporate the offence of torture into itsdomestic legislation as required, and that there existed no legal provision that would allow it to classifythe impugned conduct as acts of torture. The Court then relied on art.608 of the Criminal Code, whichdeals with abuse of authority against arrested or detained persons, to continue the proceedings though, asseen previously, the statutory limitation period for the offence in question had elapsed and the proceedingswere discontinued. Disciplinary decisions were issued against four of the officers on 29 January 2013,with CB and MS dismissed from their functions and AD and DB suspended from duty for four and six96 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsmonths respectively. CB was, however, reinstated on 26 November 2013 following an appeal to the Courtof Cassation who, in their judgment of 11 July 2013, suspended the binding nature of the Asti DistrictCourt’s judgment delivered on 30 January 2012.The applicants submitted their application to the Court on 14 and 21 December 2012 respectively,claiming a violation of art.3. The Court considered that the applications should be joined, given theirrelated factual and legal background.Held(1) The Court analysed the case with respects to both a substantive and procedural violation ofart.3. They found both aspects of the complaint admissible within the meaning of art.35(3)(a).Having done so the Court delivered a unanimous judgment with respects to the case.(2) There had been a violation of the substantive limb of art.3 (unanimous). Concerning thesubstantive violation of art.3, the Court established the facts of this part of the complaint onthe uncontested factual submissions by the two applicants. Their analysis began by reiteratingthe general principles of the substantive limb of art.3. In doing so, they highlighted thatfinding a form of ill-treatment tantamount to torture requires a distinction between tortureand inhuman or degrading treatment as embodied under art.3. Two core elements wereestablished for finding conduct which amounts to torture. First, the severity of the treatmentand particularly whether it was deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruelsuffering. Second, the purposive element of the treatment and whether it was committedwith the aim of obtaining information, inflicting punishment or intimidating. The Courtfound the treatment of the applicants attained the threshold of deliberate inhuman treatmentcausing very serious and cruel suffering. The decision was made having considered thephysical suffering of the applicants, their extremely serious “material” deprivations, theconsiderable fear, anguish and mental suffering such treatment would have caused and theirsituations of vulnerability as a result of being in custody. The Court subsequently went onto assess whether there was a purposive element to the treatment. They viewed the treatmentof the applicants was deliberate and carried out in a premeditated and organised manner,with this decision influenced by the repeated and systematic nature of the treatment enduredby the applicants. This systematic element was further analysed, with the Court finding thatit indicated “the existence of a purposive element underlying the impugned treatment, namelyto punish the detainees, to enforce discipline and to deter future disorderly behaviour in thecorrectional facility”.(3) There had been a violation of the procedural limb of art.3 (unanimous).The procedural complaint was based on the violation of art.3 that had occurred because ofthe time-limit applied in the domestic prosecution and the failure to introduce an offence oftorture domestically. This part of the application initially relied on art.3 in conjunction withart. 13, though the Court decided to solely consider it under the procedural limb of art.3.Italy contested the submissions regarding this complaint and argued that the disciplinaryproceedings that had occurred within the proceedings had procedural guarantees that arecomparable to those applied in criminal proceedings. The Court noted that reading art. 3with art.1 meant that there is a general duty to conduct an effective official investigation.The Court noted that the domestic proceedings had been conducted within a reasonable timeand that the domestic proceedings themselves could not be criticised. However, the Courtfound that in having to rely on existing offences to classify the impugned conduct, they wereforced to apply offences which were “incapable of addressing the full range of issues ensuingfrom the acts of torture which the applicants suffered”. Equally, the Court considered thatCase and Comment 97[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthe fact the prosecutions were subject to a statutory limitation period “sits uneasily with theCourt’s case-law concerning torture or ill-treatment inflicted by state agents”. The Courtconcluded that the problem rested not with the domestic judicial authorities but rather withthe Italian criminal law framework, “and in particular the absence of provisions penalisingthe practices referred to in art.3”. Citing Cestaro v Italy (App. No.6884/11, judgment of 7April 2015), the Court found that the domestic legislation was “both inadequate in terms ofits capacity to punish the acts of torture in issue and devoid of any deterrent effect capableof preventing similar future violations of art.3”. The Court then assessed the state’s claimsconcerning the adequacy of the domestic disciplinary procedures. Though they admitted theprison officers were subject to serious scrutiny and were disciplined as a result, the Courtreiterated that such procedures by themselves cannot be considered sufficient and that failingto suspend the officers once charged contravened established case-law. The Court assertedthat “only a criminal prosecution is capable of providing the preventive effect and dissuasiveforce required to fulfil the requirements of Art. 3”.Cases consideredAbdülsamet Yaman v Turkey (App. No.32446/96), judgment of 2 November 2004Al Nashiri v Poland (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 16Bartesaghi Gallo v Italy (App. Nos 12131/13 and 43390/13), judgment of 22 June 2017Bouyid v Belgium [GC] (2016) 62 E.H.R.R. 32Cestaro v Italy (App. No.6884/11), judgment of 7 April 2015El-Masri v Macedonia [GC] (2013) 57 E.H.R.R. 25Gäfgen v Germany [GC] (2011) 52 E.H.R.R. 1Hellig v Germany (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 3Myumyun v Bulgaria (App. No.67258/13), judgment of 3 November 2015Saba v Italy (App. No.36629/10), judgment of 1 July 2014Zeynep Özcan v Turkey (App. No.45906/99), judgment of 20 February 2007CommentaryThis judgment contains an important reiteration of a state’s obligation to criminalise torture domestically,an obligation that Italy has consistently failed to comply with, giving rise to numerous cases broughtbefore the Court on the same ground. It clearly shows the importance the Court places on having domesticlegislation in place to aid the realisation of the human rights obligations of states. However, this is clearlyonly one component necessary to realise an “effective investigation” and it further requires a closeexamination of the time period in which the investigation takes place and the willingness of the domesticjudiciary to apply the legislation appropriately. In many respects the most interesting assertion within thejudgment is the Court’s willingness to find that criminal prosecution is a necessary component of art.3.In stating that “only a criminal prosecution is capable of providing the preventive effect and dissuasiveforce required to fulfil the requirements of art.3”, the Court has seemingly adopted an approach akin toart.7 of the UNConvention against Torture. Equally important was their continued statements that domesticdisciplinary proceedings, though an accepted part of such procedures, are not in themselves sufficient tohold state agents to account for violations of art.3. Though this approach has been seen within the citedGäfgen judgment, among others, it is one of the most explicit statements by the Court that states are underan obligation to prosecute those who violate art.3. In this case, the Court stressed the deterrent effect ofincorporating domestic legislation defining and criminalising acts of torture and ill-treatment and theprosecuting of those who commit such acts.98 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsBook ReviewsTax Havens and International Human Rights, by Paul Beckett, (Routledge, 2017),220 pages, hardback, £115, ISBN: 978-1138668874.Paul Beckett’s book on tax havens and international human rights seeks to shine a human rights light onthe workings of tax havens and provides a useful resource for human rights advocates working in thefields of tax justice, accountability and transparency. He argues that campaigns that focus on the taxationelements of offshore finance alone aremissing the real issue that impacts on human rights—the developmentof legislation and structures that create a brick wall for international accountability.This book provides an insight into the technical details of some of those structures. Separate chaptersdescribe the specific legislative frameworks and structures that help to create international accountabilitygaps, including an analysis of offshore company and trust structures, the facilitation of beneficial ownershipavoidance and the characteristics of tax avoidance and tax evasion, before highlighting these in countryexamples.Beckett explores the problem of defining a “tax-haven” and looks at the rather blurred line betweenhow a jurisdiction is given the negative label of a “tax haven” or the more neutral categorisation as an“international finance centre.” By studying and comparing the jurisdictions of the Isle of Man andSwitzerland Paul Beckett explains the differentiation in terms of the reasons behind the creation oflegislation and structures that favour the financial sector and the scale of accountability. He concludesthat, while the Isle of Man is more properly described as an international financial centre, Switzerland isthe “grandfather of all tax havens.” His analysis sidesteps the popular image of a tax haven as a palm-fringedatoll and concludes that countries like Switzerland and the United States are as problematic from a humanrights perspective as the traditional targets of the tax haven label.While it does not offer direct answers to the human rights issues created by tax havens, it does raise anumber of questions and recommendations for future work in this area. The recommendations at the endof the book highlight a number of different areas where work needs to be done, including analysis of theinternational human rights law applicable to different jurisdictions, shifts in reporting responsibilities fordependent territories, statistical analyses of tax haven structures and calls on the international communityto revive existing instruments like the Ruggie Principles and the UN Global Compact to make them moreeffective in addressing the global accountability gap in international finance. In that sense, the book is aninvitation to further research and a call to action rather than a definitive assessment of the implicationson human rights internationally of offshore financial centres.Against the backdrop of the Panama and Paradise papers, Paul Beckett has produced a careful analysisof some of the challenges that the international financial system poses to international human rights. Thisis a relatively new area and is often dealt with in headline grabbing general terms that blur the distinctionsbetween what is illegal and what is immoral. Paul Beckett sidesteps the headlines to open up a practicaland technical debate about how to address the accountability gaps. This book should be a useful primerfor human rights advocates seeking a more detailed assessment of the structures and frameworks in whichinternational finance operates so as to target their arguments about accountability and human rights moreeffectively in this sphere.Susie Alegre**Associate Tenant, Doughty Street Chambers; Director, Island Rights Intiative.99[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsOpinion“Human Dignity is Inviolable. It must beRespected and Protected”: Retaining the EUCharter of Fundamental Rights after BrexitCatherine Dupré*University of ExeterBrexit; Codification; Fundamental rights; Human dignity; Human rightsAbstractAs Parliament continues its discussion of the EU Withdrawal Bill, this article reflects on the significanceof the EUCharter of Fundamental Rights for the UK in the post-Brexit context. Emphasising the importanceof the Charter due to the unique range of rights that it protects, and focusing on its most emblematicprovision, namely the commitment to protect and respect inviolable human dignity under art.1, the articleexplores the Charter’s contribution to rights protection and the possible implications of its loss post-Brexit.The article outlines three principal arguments: the importance of codification in the field of human rightslaw, the need to retain clear awareness of the Charter’s politico-legal foundations and objectives, andthe need for special legislation to guarantee Charter rights in the UK for the future.We will never know whether those who voted in favour of leaving the EU in the June 2016 referendumalso voted in favour of losing all the rights codified in the EUCharter of Fundamental Rights (EU Charter).Adopted in 2000 and in force under the Lisbon Treaty since 2009, it is the latest European bill of rightsand, with its unique range of rights, it represents a remarkably innovative approach to human rightsprotection,1 beyond the (almost exclusive) focus on civil and political rights of the European Conventionon Human Rights (ECHR) adopted in 1950, and beyond the specialist human rights treaties that have beendeveloped at the international level, but remain outside the UK dualist constitutional order. Yet theGovernment has so far been quite forceful in its endeavour to exclude the EU Charter from the EU(Withdrawal) Bill, which is otherwise intended to retain most EU legislation.2 The Government’s coreargument for excluding the EU Charter is that it merely codifies existing rights that are already retainedby the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, and does not add any new rights. So, the argument goes on, people in theUKwill not lose out after Brexit.3 Admittedly, the common law is resourceful and human dignity has beenincreasingly protected in the wake of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA 1998),4 but UK law contains no*Catherine Dupré is an Associate Professor in Comparative Constitutional Law at the University of Exeter Law School.1 S.

Three points are discussed. First, it is well-known that the distinction between codification and creationof new rights can sometimes be very thin, as making rights visible to all in one single and consistentlydrafted document is the first step in effective use and protection of these rights. In this respect the Charterof Fundamental Rights of the EU: Right by Right Analysis (the Analysis) produced by the Governmenton 5 December 2017 is a striking illustration of the benefits of codification for greater visibility andeffective protection of rights, and this is nowhere clearer than in relation to art.1. Secondly, what wouldbe lost with the EU Charter is much more than a set of rights (even assuming along the Government’sline that UK judges could easily reconstruct them as the need arises on a case-by-case basis out of thetangled mass of retained EU law and existing common law). The UK would lose the post-totalitarianfoundation for human rights and the overall purpose of their protection. Thirdly, and on this basis, thearticle argues that to honour the UK’s “long tradition of commitment to human rights” emphasised by theGovernment,5 retaining the Charter in a standalone Act of Parliament with elevated political importancesimilar to that of constitutional statutes, would be a timely precaution in a state where human rightsprotection is not formally guaranteed beyond the current parliament.61. Codification: visibility and effective protection of human dignity and rightsThe distinction between codification and creation of new rights has come back into the UK discussion,7with the government claiming the EU Charter is only a codification8 and the Labour party that it alsocreates new rights.9 It might be useful to remember that at the start of their historical developments, whatwe now call human rights were not codified, and Enlightenment philosophers conceived them as naturalrights, namely rights that human beings have because of their humanity. This very bold assertion at thetime was part of a vision of, or longing for, emancipation from absolute power with its abuses and injustice.Yet this vision could only fully materialise after momentous events that shook the world, namely theFrench and American revolutions, and the SecondWorldWar and the Holocaust, which were immediatelyfollowed by codification of those rights labelled human in the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of HumanRights (UN UDHR).10 If rights can exist in the absence of codification, “in the state of nature” asEnlightenment philosophers would say, to be effectively protected, rights must be properly codified. Tobe sure, the UK in 2018 is not France in 1788 or America in 1775; the UK is a constitutional monarchywith a rich body of human rights legislation and case-law, to which the EU law corpus would be addedas a result of the coming into force of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. However, protecting human rights remainsan evolving challenge in the twenty-first century, and one of the key reasons for adopting the EU Charterin the first place, as indicated in its preamble, was the necessity “to strengthen the protection of fundamentalrights in the light of changes in society, social progress and scientific and technological developments bymaking those rights more visible in a Charter”.11 In the post-Brexit context, to these reasons, which have5 The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU: Right by Right Analysis (5 December 2017) (“Analysis”), p.5.6Conservative Manifesto of 2017: “We will not repeal or replace the HRA while the process of Brexit is underway, but we will consider our humanrights legal framework when the process of leaving the EU completes. We will remain signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights forthe next parliament.” The 2015 Conservative Manifesto promised that they would seek to “scrap the Human Rights Act”.7J.H.Merryman, The Civil Law Tradition: An Introduction to the Legal Systems of Europe and Latin America, 3rd edn (Stanford: Stanford UniversityPress, 2007).8Analysis, p.4.9 Paul Blomsfeld, Shadow Minister for Exiting the EU, HC Hansard, 21 November 2017, col.889.10 J.

Invisible rights are quite difficult to use and easy to misuse.The importance of codified rights in a single document is nowhere clearer than with reference to theEU Charter provision on human dignity as presented by the Government’s Analysis, aiming to “set outhow the Government considers that fundamental rights that are currently protected by EU law will beprotected after exit from the EU”.13 The Analysis dedicates a few paragraphs to each of the Charter rightsand focuses on art.1 of the EU Charter on p.17. If we ignore the text of this provision that the Governmentwants to take out of UK law, what would be left of human dignity would encompass two substantivedimensions: (i) a reference to the European Court of Justice case ofNetherlands v Parliament and Council(Case C-3777/98) using this concept in relation to the legal protection of biotechnological inventions;14and (ii) a reference to the SW v United Kingdom 1995 ruling delivered by the European Court of HumanRights. In addition, the significance of human dignity is highlighted in the following ways: (i) a mentionof human dignity as being “the real basis of fundamental rights” with reference to the 1948 UN UDHR,which has no binding force; (ii) a note that “respect of human dignity is at the core of the UK’s internationalhuman rights obligations and the domestic human rights framework”, and a quotation from the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights case above according to which “the very essence [of the ECHR] is respect forhuman dignity and human freedom”. Finally, in relation to the legal nature of human dignity, the Analysisstates that it is a “general principle of EU law”. This re-construction of human dignity under art.1 of theEU Charter is not inaccurate.It is, however, so incomplete and so oversimplified that it comes close to either sheer ignorance orintellectual dishonesty, with both being equally problematic for a document designed to convince Parliamentthat there is no need to retain the EU Charter after Brexit. Admittedly, human dignity is an immenselyrich and complex legal concept that does not lend itself to short summaries.15 It is also a relatively newlegal concept at the EU level with limited case-law so far.16 Nevertheless, and allowing for the brevity ofthe Analysis, the following key points ought to have been made clear in relation to human dignity’sdevelopment in European case-law: one regarding the extent of EU law on human dignity, and the otherrelating to ECHR law.First, there is far more EU case-law on human dignity and the ruling singled out by the Analysis is anisolated instance pre-dating the EU Charter,17 which is therefore not representative of the post-Chartercase-law developments that have tended to focus on the protection of asylum seekers.18 The very first ofsuch cases is arguably difficult to ignore for the UK government as it was a ruling against the UK clarifyingthe status of Protocol 30.19 Moreover, EU law has used human dignity in far more areas than the Analysismakes out, notably in relation to protection against discrimination in a wide range of situations, including12House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution, Report on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, 29 January 2018, HL Paper 69.13Analysis, Introduction, point 2.14Netherlands v Parliament and Council (C-377/98) [2001] E.C.R. 7079.15C.

For a start, the neutrally—and accurately—cited SW v United Kingdom 1995 case, is known asthe marital rape case, a case that on its own demonstrates not only the need to acknowledge human dignityin a civilised legal order, but to do so in a codified provision visible to all. Until that case, the commonlaw and UK Parliament saw no overwhelming reason to lift the immunity against rapist husbands.21 Theconfirmation that this was fundamentally “unacceptable” came from the ECHR that, in SW v UnitedKingdom, sealed its reasoning with its reference to the protection of human dignity and human freedomas the essence of the ECHR, making it (as the Analysis notes) the leitmotiv of its human dignity case-lawdevelopment.22 It is because neither judges nor the government can ever be fully trusted to protect people’sdignity, especially perhaps that of so-called unpopular minorities, that a codified bill of rights is needed.Moreover, the European Court of Human Rights has explicitly protected human dignity (since the 1995infamous marital rape ruling) in a very diffuse and pervasive manner, and there is far more ECHR case-lawon human dignity than the Analysis suggests.23 The difficulty with this case-law, however, is not the lackof protection, but the lack of visibility and perhaps also consistency in approaching this uncodified right.As things stand, there is very little academic analysis of ECHR case-law on human dignity to help makemore sense of it.24 As a result, this lack of visibility and systematic knowledge of ECHR case-law onhuman dignity may lead to uneven and weak protection. This is well illustrated in the Analysis itself,which fails to mention that ECHR case-law on human dignity tends to protect people against torture,inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment (art.3 of the ECHR) and against slavery, servitude andforced or compulsory labour (art.4 of the ECHR). Finally, the Analysis makes no mention of the fact thathuman dignity in the ECHR case-law has so far played a unique role in protecting some of the mostvulnerable members of society against the worst possible types of mistreatments. Among this vast bodyof case-law, well-known in the UK (and presumably to the Government and their advisers) are art.3 ECHRcases on corporal punishment of school boys,25 treatment of mentally ill prisoners,26 and of mentally illpeople in police custody,27 life-long sentences,28 and domestic servitude under art.4 of the ECHR.29 TheAnalysis also omits to note that all these rights are encompassed in Ch.1 of the EUCharter entitled “humandignity”, which has further and explicitly extended the ECHR protection in at least three explicit directions:(i) the absolute prohibition of the death penalty (art.2); (ii) the protection of physical and mental integrity,including the absolute prohibition of eugenic practices, the “prohibition on making the human body andits parts as such a source of financial gain”, and the prohibition of the reproductive cloning of humanbeings (art.3); and (iii) the prohibition of human trafficking (art.5). This omission is significant as itillustrates the benefit of codification over having to analyse and reconstruct a vast body of case-law inorder to identify relevant rights. As is discussed below, visibility of rights is not the only benefit of retainingthe EU Charter.20 See also art.25 (the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence) and art.31 (the right to “working conditions which respect[workers’] health, safety and dignity”).21House of Lords, R. v R.

Inviolable human dignity: the foundational promise of human rights anddemocracyIf the coverage of human dignity’s substantive dimensions and scope of protection in the Analysis isproblematically selective, it becomes inaccurate in a further glaring omission, namely the resoundingdeclaration of human dignity’s inviolability under art.1 of the EU Charter. The Analysis’s statement that“there is no hierarchy of rights in the Charter; no one right is more important than another”30 is inaccurate.On the contrary, the EUCharter is characterised by hierarchies of human rights: at the very top is inviolablehuman dignity, followed by a set of absolute prohibitions (all in Ch.1), with the remaining majority ofrights subject to restrictions under the specific conditions outlined in the EUCharter and the ECHR togetherwith its case-law. In addition, the Analysis describes human dignity as “a general principle of EU law”,31a qualification that it tends to use to dismiss the importance of specific provisions of the EU Charter asbeing not enforceable.32 Finally, despite acknowledging that “the right to human dignity constitutes thereal basis of human rights”,33 the Analysis minimises the unique feature of human dignity as the foundationof the human rights protection paradigm since 1948 (to use the UN UDHR as the point of reference).34The significance of the commitment to protect and respect inviolable human dignity can be unravelled asfollows.First, the term “inviolability” associated with human dignity under art.1 of the EU Charter connotesan even greater normative force than “absolute” (which is the ECHR approach to human dignity underits arts 3 and 4) and which will disappear if the Charter is not retained. Inviolability arguably indicatesthat the commitment to respect and protect human dignity is so fundamental that it needs to be explicitlydistinguished from absolute rights. The protection of human dignity is not just a matter of enhanced degree(e.g. more than absolute), it is also qualitatively different, namely it is about protecting the core attributeof humanity.35 This is why it is positioned at the very start of the EU Charter, not only above the law(normative hierarchy), but also outside the law, so that no law may undermine it. In other words, thecommitment to respect and protect inviolable human dignity is a precondition to human rights and theaxiomatic basis of democracy. While rights were almost from the start (e.g. 1776 and 1789 declarations)described as inalienable, the reference to “inviolability” emerged after 1945, together with the codificationof human dignity in the UNUDHR in 1948 and in the constitutions of (what were to become) EUMemberStates.36 This contextual awareness is crucial to understand the significance of inviolable human dignity.It is suggested that the dignity commitment under the EU Charter captures the memory—very fresh indrafters’ minds at the time—of “barbarous acts which outraged the conscience of mankind”.37This deliberateand explicit commitment not to forget can be traced back to the origins of human rights codification,38 butin the post-totalitarian context—and this is a key innovation—it is buttressed with a set of absolute andquasi-absolute prohibitions under arts 2, 3 and 4 of the ECHR, which were endorsed and enhanced by theEUCharter under its first chapter. Seen in this light, the commitment to inviolable human dignity demarcatesthe past of inhumanity, barbarism and totalitarianism from the present that is willed as a time free of thesenegative features, i.e. as a time of humanity, civilisation and democracy.39 The commitment to respect and30Analysis, p.4.31Analysis, p.17.

This year, as it happens,HolocaustMemorial Day almost coincided with the vote against the EUCharter in the House of Commons.It is difficult to understand why the UK, which played a key role in the fight against Nazism and fascism,would want explicitly to exclude this foundational memory of the fallibility of democracy, and would notwant to renew its commitment to protect humanity as it leaves the EU. To be clear, the risk of fascist andNazi regimes returning to power in an EUMember State is—let us hope—low, even despite the disquietingrise to government of xenophobic parties with a troubled heritage elsewhere in Europe. Nevertheless, thethreats to and the vulnerability of humanity are here for all to see,40 and the UK is no exception.41Secondly, as the inviolable foundation of rights, human dignity protects the core attributes of humanityas enshrined under Ch.1 of the EU Charter, namely those without which humanity is no longer possible,whether because humanity is physically annihilated (through the death penalty), because humanity is takenout of human beings (e.g. through torture or slavery) or because the genetic make-up of humanity isdeliberately interfered with (e.g. eugenics practices, reproductive human cloning). As will be recalledfrom above, the Charter extends the protection of humanity beyond ECHR law, and, therefore, not retainingthe Charter might set the principled level of humanity protection back to what it was when the ECHR wasadopted in 1950. The genetic dimensions of humanity protected under art.3(2) of the EU Charter reflecttypical twenty-first century efforts to protect “humanity as it is” against transformations that are (or willsoon be) scientifically and technically possible. What is at stake here is the preservation of the very essenceof humanity and the use of “inviolable human dignity” as a compass to help make difficult decisions attimes of uncertainty.42 The risk entailed, however, is not merely about alterations to the genetic make-upof humanity. What the commitment to protect and respect inviolable dignity arguably also involves ispreventing dehumanisation processes, i.e. of the exclusive reduction of human beings to a source of profit,be it a convenient pool of organs, cells and genes to be traded like any other type of commodity, or thedegradation of workers to a mere source of revenue for their “employers”. In this sense the absoluteprohibitions “on making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain” (art.3(2)) andon “trafficking in human beings” (art.5(3)) are both about the same danger. In other words, in these twopractices, human beings are reduced to mere numbers, and thus deprived of their humanity, they becomethe objects of the economic logic of maximum profit.43 It is not a coincidence that the other two mentionsof dignity in the EU Charter involved people whose lives are directly affected by free-market economy:either as workers (art.31) who are at the heart of economic activity, or as elderly people (art.25) who areno longer economically active, and nevertheless have a right “to lead a life of dignity and independenceand to participate in social and cultural life”. In the post-Brexit context without this explicit commitmentto respect and protect inviolable human dignity, the risk of dehumanisation will be heightened by thedisappearance of this shield against the worst side-effects of market-based systems.Thirdly, what will be lost if the commitment to inviolable human dignity under the EU Charter is notretained is also the ultimate purpose of human rights protection. Taking away that commitment will notonly make human dignity invisible, but it would also flatten the human rights framework of protectionand remove from sight—and from law—the overall priority of humanity’s protection that is encapsulatedby that commitment. The absolute prohibitions under the ECHR would remain for a while, but theGovernment also intends to revisit this when Brexit is completed, as they explicitly indicated in their 2017Manifesto.44 So, at worst, these would not be retained at all, or perhaps retained in a format that limits the40M.

The Joint Report from the Negotiators of the EU and the UK Government of 8 December 2017 only focuses on EU citizens’residence status after Brexit, but does not discuss the EU Charter’s absolute protection of its Ch.1 rights.106 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorscurrent effectiveness of their protection. In this scenario, humanity would cease to be a special good atthe heart of human rights requiring special protection by law and taking priority over other interests, bethey political or economic. The overall purpose of human rights as the ultimate barrier againstdehumanisation and barbarism would be dissolved as a result. Protecting humanity would no longer bethe priority of human rights and, in the absence of formal entrenchment,45 the constitutional weight to giveto human dignity would therefore be set through a process of bargaining on a case-by-case basis. Thisflattening process is particularly problematic in the post-Brexit context as retained EU law is due to loseits supremacy over domestic law, so that whatever right—and possibly dignity-related rights too—mightbe reconstructed will have the same normative ranking as other non-rights-related-norms. As a result, UKlaw conflicting with these rights could not be disapplied.46The disappearance of inviolable human dignity as the ultimate purpose of human rights and beacon ofdemocracy would leave the UK without a clear direction and tools to protect humanity, at a time whenthey might need them most. A state, such as the UK post-Brexit, which deliberately turns its back on thepost-totalitarian commitment to human dignity, which is also an explicitly built-in requirement for theEU external relations, might have a difficult task to convince fellow trading partners, such as the EU itselfor its Member States (to the extent that they retain such a commitment themselves), that it is safe to engagein relationships with.3. Retaining the EU Charter as a standalone constitutional statuteLooking ahead to the post-Brexit context and considering the strategic significance of the EU Chartertogether with its strongest and most emblematic provision—the commitment to inviolable humandignity—this section briefly makes two final points.First, it is important to note that the commitment to human dignity appears in two other very significantprovisions of the TEU that are relevant to the post-Brexit context. Article 2 of the TEU provides that:“The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality,the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination,tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.”47Article 21 of the TEU provides that:“The Union’s action on the international scene shall be guided by principles which have inspiredits own creation, development and enlargement, and which it seeks to advance in the wider world:democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamentalfreedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for theprinciples of the United Nations Charter and international law.”48While the Government has not yet (at the time of writing) outlined a precise post-Brexit plan toreconstruct its relationship with the EU, it is certain that the UK will continue trading with the EU andengaging in a range of other relationships with its Member States. Post-Brexit UK will not be just anythird country, it will be a third country whose government has vehemently rejected the EU and, crucially,it will be a third country that—together with Poland currently targeted by the art.7 of the TEUprocedure—expressed explicit reservation against the EU Charter under Protocol 30. Therefore, and from45 Joint Committee on Human Rights, The Human Rights Implications of Brexit, 19 December 2016, HL Paper 88 of session 2016–17, p.19.46 Joint Committee on Human Rights, Legislative Scrutiny: The EU (Withdrawal) Bill: A Right by Right Analysis, 24 January 2018, HL Paper 70HC 774, paras 9-12.47Emphasis added.48Emphasis added, generally see P. Eeckhout, EU External Relations Law, 2nd edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011).Opinion 107[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsa pragmatic point of view, it is suggested that retaining the EU Charter and its explicit commitment tohuman dignity under art.1 might be a good strategy for the first former EU Member State to indicate tothe EU its acknowledgement of the EU’s first foundational value under art.2 of the TEU, and its willingnessto abide by art.21 of the TEU. This might be all the more worthy of consideration given that Brexit isunfolding at the same time as the EU is seeking to tighten its monitoring and sanctioning ofMember Statesthat fail to comply with art.2 EU values.49 As a result and in recent years, the EU has become quite awareof these values’ significance for safeguarding post-totalitarian democracy founded in human dignity. TheEU has also become increasingly aware of the need to ensure that its actions towards non-compliantMember States match its own standards and commitments as set out in the TEU, specifically under arts2 and 21.Secondly, building on this and considering the uncertain future of the HRA 1998 under the 2015 and2017 Conservative Manifestos, it is suggested that the EU (Withdrawal) Bill might be envisaged as anopportunity to secure human rights. Indeed, if the UK were to retain only one distinct and self-containednormative text from its 40 years of EU membership and shared adventure in the construction of anunprecedented type of democracy, the EU Charter would be an eminently suitable choice to make. A keyproblem associated with the EU (Withdrawal) Bill is not just that the Charter would be lost, with victims,lawyers, judges and government left to put together its various pieces scattered across the law, it is thatEU law and with the EU Charter would lose its supremacy status.50 As a result, even retaining the EUCharter as a whole would not retain the commitment to protect and respect inviolable human dignity,for—as discussed above—it could always be superseded by a later Act of Parliament (or judgment withregards to human dignity dimensions that are only protected through case law). One way to counter thiseventuality is arguably to give the retained EUCharter a special constitutional status, akin to that currentlyacknowledged for the HRA 1998. However, this constitutional statute contains no explicit commitmentto “inviolable human dignity” and indeed not even a mention of human dignity. In addition, repealing theHRA 1998 is constitutionally possible and is on the current government’s political agenda. Recognisingthe retained EU Charter as having a similar constitutional status would not prevent its repeal, depletingtherefore the human dignity commitment of its political, sociological and normative significance. TheBrexit project and process have so far raised many novel and difficult constitutional questions for the UK,and finding a constitutional and political way to retain the commitment to inviolable human dignityrepresents another such challenge.ConclusionExcluding the EU Charter from the EU (Withdrawal) Bill will put an end to a brief experiment, barely adecade long (2009–2019), during which the central tenets of free-market economy were explicitly framedby some protection for human beings and their rights. While the UK Government’s overarching claimsthat it “does not intend that the substantive rights protected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights will beweakened”,51 this article has sought to demonstrate that the merits of retaining the EU Charter are notlimited to the visibility of codified rights, but also include their effective protection. Indeed, codifyinghuman dignity as inviolable lies at the heart of a particular type of democracy, and is a crucial aspect ofthe extent to which the UK wishes to continue upholding an inclusive protection of humanity in thepost-Brexit context. As discussed above, a return to a status quo ante, which implicitly seems to be theGovernment’s leading assumption, might turn the clock back to a pre-1948 situation, an ironic move in49A.

He argued that the tests prejudicedhis fundamental rights, but this was also rejected. On the question of whether an expertreport could be taken into consideration, it was held that it could be, as long as the proceduresfor the report were consistent with fundamental rights, and as long as the decision was notbased solely on the report and the authorities were not bound by it. It was held that relyingon the report was not consistent with the right to private and family life.Article 16• Polkomtel (C-277/16), 20 December 2017, the President of the Office for ElectronicCommunications had identified Polkomtel as an undertaking with significant market power,and sought to adjust and verify its mobile termination rate.

It was held that the executing state must refuse to surrender minors if, under theirlaw, they have not reached the age of majority.Article 41• Spain v Council (C-521/15), 20 December 2017, Spain reported its government deficits for2008–2012 to Eurostat in March 2012, only to revise them in May 2012, which promptedan investigation intomanipulation of statistics in Spain by the Commission.Misrepresentationby Spain was found and therefore a fine was imposed. Spain sought annulment of thisdecision on grounds that there was no objective impartiality in the investigation. Theapplication was rejected.Article 47• Hasan (C-360/16), 25 January 2018, the claimantmade an application for asylum inGermany,but Eurodac showed he had already applied for international protection in Italy. He was tobe returned to Italy under the Dublin III Regulation, so Germany rejected his asylumapplication. He requested a suspension, which was also rejected. He was returned to Italy,but then illegally returned to Germany, upon which he appealed his return to Italy on thegrounds that it was after the six-month time-limit under Dublin III. The Court held he hadhad an effective remedy;• El Hassani (C-403/15), 13 December 2017, a third country national submitted a Schengenvisa application in Poland to visit his Polish wife and son, but was refused.

His claim was upheld;• Ardic (C-571/17 PPU), 22 December 2017, a German national in the Netherlands had anEAW executed against him for two offences, for both of which he appeared in person duringthe trial.

He was not present at the revocation decision. It washeld that “trial resulting in a decision” in art.4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584 doesnot include the revocation decision if that decision does not change the nature or the levelof the sentence initially imposed.Articles 47 and 51• Protect Natur-, Arten- und Landschaftsschutz Umweltorganisation (C-664/15), 20 December2017, in which a ski resort requested an extension for a permit for a snow-production facilityin Austria, which Protect contested.

The time-limit to bringing the claim was also held to beagainst the right to effective judicial protection.Article 49• Vaditrans (C-102/16), 20 December 2017, a fine for lorry drivers taking regular weekly restperiods in the vehicle itself were contested by the claimant on the grounds that the fine didnot have a proper legal basis. It was held that the fine did not infringe the principle of legalityin criminal law;• MAS and MB (C-42/17), 5 December 2017, in the Taricco judgment, national criminalproceedings related to VAT fraud could only be extended by a quarter of their initial duration.There was a question as to whether this was compatible with obligations under art.325(1)and (2) of the TFEU under which, to ensure effective and dissuasive penalties, there mustbe the ability to provide for longer limitation periods. It was held acceptable to disapplynational limitations to comply with obligations under art.325(1) and (2) of the TFEU andextend the limitation.European Court of Human RightsThe European Court of Human Rights issued, inter alia, judgment in the following during December2017–January 2018 (all articles refer to the EU Charter, unless otherwise specified):Articles 1 and 7• Nedescu v Romania (App. No.70035/10), judgment of 16 January 2018, in which the Courtheld there was a violation of the right to private and family life when a couple was preventedfrom retrieving embryos from a fertility clinic that had been closed in the process of acriminal investigation.Articles 2 and 35• Lopes de Sousa Fernandes v Portugal (App. No.56080/13), judgment of 19 December 2017[GC], in which the Court found at violation of the procedural limb of art.2 of the ECHR(right to life), because the regulatory system in the state failed to address in an adequate andtimely way the complainant’s case that her husband had died as a result of medical negligence.Articles 9 and 21• Orlandi v Italy (App. Nos 26431/12, 26742/12, 44057/12 and 60088/12), judgment of 14December 2017, in which the Court held there was a violation of the right to private andfamily life because, before 2016, the state had not offered the applicants any recogition ofBulletin: EU Charter of Fundamental Rights 117[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorstheir same-sex marriages, which had been contracted abroad.

The author argues that much of the criticism addressedto the Court is ultimately aimed at the founding principles of the European human rights protection system,like the principles of evolutive interpretation and European consensus, as well as at the Court’s soft lawand social rights friendly stance. He briefly analyses the contradictory reaction of the Court to thiscriticism. In this context, he considers that both the UK rebellion against Hirst and the Court’s backtrackingfrom its own principles of interpretation in some major cases have had a negative “snow ball” effect onother Contracting Parties to the European Convention on Human Rights, as the recent confrontationalattitude of the Russian legislator towards the Court has shown. The article concludes with a defence ofthe Court’s traditional mode of reasoning and a pledge for reform of some practices of the Court basedon three steps: more independence, more transparency and more accountability.1. Why the strain?It is stating the obvious that the current relationship between some Contracting Parties and the EuropeanCourt on Human Rights (the Court) is a strained one.2 But why the strain?There are two types of critiques, one of political and the other of legal nature, levelled against theCourt. The political criticism is encapsulated in the idea that the Strasbourg judge acts as a subsidiarylegislator, an Ersatzgesetzgeber. This criticism is directed to the allegedly obscure working methods ofthe Court, the supposedly deficient status of Strasbourg judges and the apparent lack of consideration forthe British exceptional situation.The argument drawn from the working methods of the Court is the following: judicial activism leadsthe Court to a mission creep.3 By means of a not-so-transparent development of the case-law, the Courtattempts to aggrandise itself. This is most visible in the invention of new rights and the enlargement ofits own supervisory powers. The Court’s micro-management of cases threatens democracy and statesovereignity, since Governments lose control of the European Convention on Human Rights (theConvention) and domestic authorities are side-stepped and discredited.1This article merges my speeches delivered at the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights, Mansfield College, Oxford, 28 April 2017 (“Is the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights facing an existential crisis?”), and at the Middlesex University, London, 15 December 2017 (“How to save the European Courtof Human Rights in three steps”).

(Hart Publishing, 2015).3On this line of reasoning see Marc Bossuyt, “Judicial Activism in Strasbourg”, in Karel Wellens (ed.), International Law in Silver Perspective(2015), pp.31–56; Dragoljub Popović, “Prevailing of Judicial Activism over Self-Restraint in the Jurisprudence of the European Court of HumanRights” (2009) 42 Creighton Law Review 361, and Paul Mahoney, “Judicial Activism and Judicial Self-Restraint in the European Court of HumanRights: Two Sides of the Same Coin” (1990) 11 Human Rights Law Journal 57.119[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsLord Hoffmann put it this way:“[t]he proposition that the Convention is a ‘living instrument’ is the banner under which the StrasbourgCourt has assumed power to legislate what they consider to be required by ‘European public order’.I would entirely accept that the practical expression of concepts employed in a treaty or constitutionaldocument may change. To take a common example, the practical application of the concept of a cruelpunishment may not be the same today as it was even 50 years ago. But that does not entitle a judicialbody to introduce wholly new concepts, such as the protection of the environment, into an internationaltreaty which makes no mention of them, simply because it would be more in accordance with thespirit of the times.”4The argument based on the status of the judges states that the Strasbourg judge lacks political legitimacyto act as a subsidiary legislator, the Court suffering from a democratic deficit.5 The problem of theunaccountable judge is aggravated by the fact that some judges come from alleged second-class democracies.The undemocratic pedigree of some Contracting Parties taints the judges’ independence and the Court’sauthority.The British exceptionalism argument goes like this: Parliament is sovereign and domestic courts mustdefer to it, and the same applies a fortiori to international courts, since that parliamentary sovereignity isprotected by a dualist system of relationship between national and international law. As Lord Neubergerput it, “the idea of courts overruling decisions of the UK parliament, as is substantially the effect of whatthe Strasbourg and the Luxembourg courts can do, is little short of offensive to our notions of constitutionalpropriety”.6The second type of critiques addressed to the Court is more complex, since they pertain to the natureof the subject-matter that the Court deals with, namely the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Convention.They turn around the motto that there is a conflict between “genuine” versus “fake” human rights. Threeclaims are made:First, human rights are residual, civil liberties which serve only minorities, not the majority of citizens.The Convention is portrayed as the villains’ charter, not as the bill of rights of the common man on thestreet. Furthermore, social rights are not human rights, not enforceable rights at all. Human rights onlyimply negative, not positive obligations and certainly not a budgetary cost. The transformation of theConvention into a desguised social charter betrays its nature.Secondly, human rights result from an originalist, “true” interpretation, not an evolutive, “abusive”interpretation. The true interpretation of the Convention is based on the travaux preparatoires and eventuallyalso on the Contracting Parties’ law at the time of drafting of the Convention. Soft law is not law, andshould not be taken into account, not even as a contextual element of interpretation of the Convention andits protocols.Thirdly, human rights are truly “homegrown”, not “foreign” rights. There are no universal humanrights. Universal human rights are indeed foreign human rights, imposed by alien judges who lack sensitivityto domestic traditions. The defence of homegrown rights imposes a sort of scepticism regarding internationallaw and bodies. Cultural relativism and legal diversity are the sole weapons to oppose to the Court’s moraltutelage.4Lord Hoffmann, “The Universality of Human Rights” (2009) 125(3) Law Quarterly Review 428.5On this line of argumentation see Kanstantsin Dzehtsiarou and Alan Greene, “Legitimacy and the Future of the European Court of Human Rights:Critical Perspectives from Academia and Practitioners” (2011) 12 German Law Journal 1707; and Tom Barkhuysen and Michiel L. van Emmerik,“Legitimacy of European Court of Human Rights Judgements: Procedural Aspects”, in N.

Evolutive interpretationA response to these claims requires us to go back to basics and recall what the European Court of HumanRights (the Court) was built for.The Council of Europe is an autonomous legal order, based on agreements and common action ineconomic, social, cultural, scientific, legal and administrative matters and in the maintenance and furtherrealisation of human rights and fundamental freedoms (art.1, para.b of the 1949 Statute of the Council ofEurope). With 217 treaties, the legal order of this international organisation has at its top an internationaltreaty, the European Convention on Human Rights. Being more than just a multilateral agreement onreciprocal obligations of States Parties, the Convention creates obligations of negative and positive naturefor States Parties towards all individuals within their jurisdiction, with a view to the practical implementationof the protected rights and freedoms in the domestic legal order of the States Parties. Put it in legal jargon,the Convention is a law-making treaty and not a mere contract treaty.Very early on, the former Commission, in its decision of 11 January 1961 in the case of Austria v Italy,expressed the same principle when it affirmed the “objective character” of the Convention:“… the obligations undertaken by the High Contracting Parties in the Convention are essentially ofan objective character, being designed rather to protect the fundamental rights of individual humanbeings from infringement by any of the High Contracting Parties than to create subjective andreciprocal rights for the High Contracting Parties themselves.”7.Therefore, the States Parties to the Convention are legally obliged not to hinder in any way the effectiveexercise of the right of individual application and to make such modifications to their domestic legalsystems as may be necessary to ensure the full implementation of the obligations incumbent on them.8Seen from another perspective, these are the consequences of the principle of good faith in fulfilling treatyobligations, provided for in arts 26 and 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.The Convention cannot be interpreted in a vacuum, but must be interpreted in harmony with otherinternational law and soft law. Ever since Golder, account shall be taken of any relevant principles andrules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties, as indicated in art.31(3)(c) of theVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969.9 Hence, the Court departs from the contested positionthat there are “self-contained regimes” within international law.10 From the Court’s perspective, there isno methodological difference between the interpretation of international human rights law and otherinternational law, or between contractual and law-making treaties, and therefore it assumes that the sameinterpretative methods can be applied in both fields of international law. As Judge Rozakis so elegantlyformulated it, the judges of Strasbourg “do not operate in the splendid isolation of an ivory tower builtwith material originating solely from the ECHR’s interpretative inventions or those of the States party tothe Convention”.11This methodology is warranted by the Court’s cardinal principle of interpretation, according to whichthe Convention must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions.12 It was in the seminal case7Commission, Austria v Italy (App. No.788/60), decision of 11 January 1961. The Court adhered to this doctrine in Ireland v United Kingdom(1978) 2 E.H.R.R. 25.8Maestri v Italy (2004) 39 E.H.R.R. 38.9Golder v United Kingdom (1975) 1 E.H.R.R. 524.10The point was already made in my opinions in Al-Dulimi and Montana Management Inc v Switzerland [GC] (App. No.5809/08), judgment of 21June 2016 at [71]; Sargsyan v Azerbaijan (2017) 64 E.H.R.R. 4, fn.23, and Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu [GC] (App.No.47848/08), judgment of 17 July 2014, fn.14.11Rozakis, “The European Judge as a Comparativist” (2005) Tulane Law Review 278.12 Tyrer v United Kingdom (1978) 2 E.H.R.R. 1 at [31]. On this method of interpretation, see among many others, Eva Brems and Janneke Gerards(eds), Shaping Rights in the ECHR: The Role of the European Court of Human Rights in Determining the Scope of Human Rights (Cambridge UniversityPress, 2013); George Letsas, A Theory of Interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights (Oxford University Press, 2009); and AndreasFllesdal, Birgit Peters and Geir Ulfstein (eds),Constituting Europe: The European Court of Human Rights in a National, European and Global Context(Cambridge University Press, 2013).Plaidoyer for the European Court of Human Rights 121[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsTyrer v United Kingdom that the Court for the very first time used the leitmotiv of “the Convention as aliving instrument”, whose interpretation has to take account of evolving norms of national and internationallaw.13 Deeply entrenched into American14 and Canadian15 constitutional law since the early twentiethcentury, this interpretation technique was introduced in European human rights law in 1978.In Tyrer, confronted with the Attorney General of the Isle of Man’s arguments advanced under formerart.63 of the Convention that, “having due regard to the local circumstances in the Island”, the continueduse of judicial corporal punishment on a limited scale was justified as a deterrent, the Court replied that:“it is noteworthy that, in the great majority of the Member States of the Council of Europe, judicialcorporal punishment is not, it appears, used and, indeed, in some of them, has never existed in moderntimes; … If nothing else, this casts doubt on whether the availability of this penalty is a requirementfor the maintenance of law and order in a European country.”By concluding that the Isle of Man must be regarded as sharing fully that “common heritage of politicaltraditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law” to which the Preamble to the Convention refers, the Courtrejected that there were local requirements affecting the application of art.3 in the Isle of Man and,accordingly, found that the applicant’s judicial corporal punishment constituted a violation of that article.Hence, since the very beginning of the Court’s existence, the evolutive interpretation of the Conventionwas intimately linked to the need for a consensual reading of the text, based on the consideration of thedomestic legal framework of the “great majority” of the Member States of the Council of Europe and,ultimately, of the common heritage of political traditions, ideals, freedom and the rule of law, to whichthe preamble makes reference.The foundational principle of evolutive interpretation has been recently put at stake inHassan v UnitedKingdom.16 Contrary to the Government’s position, the Grand Chamber affirmed that IHRL applies tointernational armed conflicts concurrently to IHL, but it went on to admit, as pleaded by the Government,that IHL, namely the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions relating to internment, may be used to qualifyand, in practical terms, to weaken IHRL standards. On the basis of an alleged subsequent practice of theContracting Parties during international armed conflicts outside Europe, which did not use the derogationclause of art.15 of the Convention in order to detain people indefinitely in such war scenario, the GrandChamber assumed that all Contracting Parties had proceeded to an implicit review of their own Conventioncommitments and enlarged the exhaustive list of detention grounds of art.5 of the Convention. The principleof evolutive interpretation of the Convention was turned upside down with a view to include in art.5 anew ground for detention, namely internment under international humanitarian law, the practicalconsequence being that in cases of international armed conflict, where the taking of prisoners of war andthe detention of civilians who pose a threat to security are accepted features of international humanitarianlaw, art.5 can be interpreted as permitting the exercise of such broad powers and the looser standards ofreview of detention of the Geneva Conventions will apply. Hence, review of such detention should takeplace by a “competent body” with “sufficient guarantees of impartiality”, and not necessarily by a judicial13 Tyrer (1978) 2 E.H.R.R. 1 at [31].14Missouri v Holland 252 U.S. 416 (1920). Writing the majority’s opinion, Justice Holmes made this remark on the nature of the constitution: “Withregard to that we may add that when we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realizethat they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It wasenough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their successors much sweat and blood toprove that they created a nation. The case before us must be considered in the light of our whole experience and not merely in that of what was said ahundred years ago.” The Supreme Court’s reference to “evolving standards of decency” is also understood as a clear mention to the “livingconstitutionalism” (see Trop v Dulles 356 U.S. 86 (1958): “The words of the [Eighth] Amendment are not precise, and that their scope is not static.The Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society”).15Henrietta Muir Edwards v The Attorney General of Canada [1929] UKPC 86, [1930] A.C. 124 (18 October 1929). The case is not only memorablebecause it established that Canadian women were eligible to be appointed senators, but also because it introduced the “living tree doctrine” in Canadianconstitutional law, according to which the constitution is organic and must be read in a broad and liberal manner so as to adapt it to changing times.16Hassan v United Kingdom [GC] (App. No.29750/09), judgment of 16 September 2014.122 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsauthority. In other words, evolutive interpretation of the Convention may now permit a regression in termsof human rights protection in Europe.3. European consensusIn Strasbourg, soft law provided, and still provides, the most important source of crystallisation of theEuropean consensus and the common heritage of values. In fact, soon after Tyrer, the Court took thefundamental step of enlarging the array of sources of law in the light of which the European consensusmay be established. In Marckx v Belgium, the Court took into consideration the European shared valuesbased on the domestic law of the “great majority” of Member States of the Council of Europe, as well asthe 1962 Convention on the Establishment of Maternal Affiliation of Natural Children, signed but notratified by the respondent State, and the Council of Europe 1975 Convention on the Legal Status ofChildren born out of Wedlock, not even signed by the respondent State, and finally the Committee ofMinisters Resolution (70) 15 of 15 May 1970 on the social protection of unmarried mothers and theirchildren. To the argument that the 1962 and the 1975 Conventions had a small number of parties, theCourt replied that“[b]oth the relevant Conventions are in force and there is no reason to attribute the currently smallnumber of Contracting States to a refusal to admit equality between ‘illegitimate’ and ‘legitimate’children on the point under consideration. In fact, the existence of these two treaties denotes thatthere is a clear measure of common ground in this area amongst modern societies.”17Mirroring the interpretative techniques of constitutional courts, the Court went even further and modulatedthe effects of its judgment, dispensing the respondent State from re-opening legal acts or situations thatantedate the delivery of the judgment. For that purpose, it made reference to the fact that “a similar solutionis found in certain Contracting States having a constitutional court: their public law limits the retroactiveeffect of those decisions of that court that annul legislation”.18 As if it were a European ConstitutionalCourt, the Court resorted to the principle of legal certainty to accord itself the implied power of modulationof the temporal effect of its own judgments.19In the landmark case ofDemir v Turkey, after having recalled that “the Convention is a living instrumentwhich must be interpreted in the light of present-day conditions, and in accordance with developments ininternational law, so as to reflect the increasingly high standard being required in the area of the protectionof human rights, thus necessitating greater firmness in assessing breaches of the fundamental values ofdemocratic societies”, and having regard to the developments in labour law, both international and national,and to the pertinent practice of Contracting States, the Court concluded that the right to bargain collectivelywith the employer had, in principle, become one of the essential elements of the right to form and to jointrade unions for the protection of one’s interests set forth in art.11 of the Convention. For that purpose, itcited the relevant ILOConventions, which the respondent State had ratified, the respective ILOCommitteeof Experts’ interpretation, as well as art.28 of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights,art.6(2) of the European Social Charter, which Turkey had not ratified, the European Committee of SocialRights’ interpretation of this article, and Principle 8 of Recommendation No.R(2000) 6 of the Committeeof Ministers of the Council of Europe on the status of public officials in Europe.20In other words, for the purpose of the interpretation of the Convention, the legal relevance of humanrights standards set out in other treaties and conventions depends neither on the number of their respective17Marckx v Belgium (1979) 2 E.H.R.R. 330 at [41].18Marckx (1979) 2 E.H.R.R. 330 at [58].19On the constitutional nature of the Court see my opinion co-written with Judge Dedov in Baka v Hungary [GC] (App. No.20261/12), judgmentof 23 June 2016, and the literature cited therein.20Demir v Turkey (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 54 at [146]–[154].Plaidoyer for the European Court of Human Rights 123[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsratifying parties, nor on the number of Council of Europe Member States bound by them and nor even onthe fact that the respondent State ratified them. Thus, under European human rights law, hard law isprofoundly interwoven with soft law.The Court’s soft law and social rights friendly stance has been questioned in recent times. A remarkableexample of this trend is National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers v United Kingdom.21The UK banned secondary action more than two decades ago and throughout this time has been subjectto critical comments by the ILO Committee of Experts and the ECSR. The applicant union prayed thesesoft law materials in aid. The Government did not consider the particular criticisms made to be relevantto the factual situation denounced in the present case, or otherwise significant. The Court acknowledgedthe wealth of international law material relevant for the case and that the analysis of the interpretativeopinions emitted by the competent bodies set up under the most relevant international instruments mirroredthe conclusion reached on the comparative material before the Court, namely that the UK’s outright banon secondary industrial action finds itself at the most restrictive end of a spectrum of national regulatoryapproaches on this point and is out of line with a discernible international trend calling for a less restrictiveapproach. Nonetheless, the Court preferred to underscore the distinct character of its review comparedwith that of the supervisory procedures of the ILO and the European Social Charter and consequently itconcluded that in this legislative policy area of recognised sensitivity the respondent State enjoys a marginof appreciation broad enough to encompass the existing statutory ban on secondary action. No violationof art.11 of the Convention was therefore found.Evolutive interpretation of the Convention also led the Court to support its reasoning by reference tonorms emanating from other Council of Europe organs, even though those organs have no function ofrepresenting State Parties to the Convention, whether supervisory mechanisms or expert bodies. In orderto interpret the exact scope of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Convention, the Court made use,for example, of the work of the European Commission for Democracy through Law (the VeniceCommission). The first case where the Court cited the Venice Commission was Hirst v United Kingdom(No.2).22 The source quoted was the “Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters”, adopted by the VeniceCommission at its 51st Plenary Session (5–6 July 2002).4. International democracyFrom the seminal formulation of the European consensus in Tyrer emanates a vision of an deliberative,international democracy in which a majority or representative proportion of the Contracting Parties to theConvention is considered to speak in the name of all and thus is entitled to impose its will on other parties.As a matter of constitutional principle formatting the Council of Europe, consensus is decoupled fromunanimity. Consensus as a volonté générale can still exist even if not all Contracting Parties concur in thesame reading of the Convention.It cannot be argued today that the founding fathers did not want this to happen, and states had beentrapped into engagements that they did not agree upon. The nowworn-out argument of lack of state consentis sometimes accompanied, as the reverse side of the coin, by the no less démodé critique to the Court’slack of political legitimacy to interpret innovatively the Convention, rectius, to create law, using soft lawto circumvent the competent legislative bodies and to flout the principles of democracy, rule of law andsubsidiarity. Underlying this speech is almost invariably the sovereignist leitmotiv in dubio pro mitius.The preamble sets the Convention against the background of the Council of Europe general aims, witha view to creating a “closer union” among Member States, based on “a common understanding andobservance of the Human Rights upon which they depend”. In the Statute of the Council of Europe, the21National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers v United Kingdom (2015) 60 E.H.R.R 10.22Hirst v United Kingdom (No.2) (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 41.124 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorslanguage used makes reference not only to a “closer unity between all like-minded countries of Europe”,but also to an “organisation which will bring European States into closer association”. The very firstArticle of the Statute sets as the aim of the Council “to achieve greater unity between its members for thepurpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage andfacilitating their economic and social progress”. In the explicit terms of the Statute, the realisation of theseideals and principles warrants “agreements and common action” in all relevant areas of social life (economic,social, cultural, scientific, legal and administrative matters) and “in the maintenance and further realisationof human rights and fundamental freedoms”. No better words could proclaim the primacy of human rightsobligations in all areas of governance. The principle in dubio pro persona could find no better formulation.23Hence, social and economic progress is intimately connected to the progress of human rights as two sidesof the same coin.This put, evolutive interpretation, European consensus and hardening of soft law comprise the threepillars of the European normative system within which state consent is relevant. In a nutshell, the Court’sgolden rule of interpretation rejects a self-contained, literal, originalist, in dubio mitius and sovereigntistConvention interpretation.Based upon these pillars from the very beginning, and animated by the common quest for “economicand social progress”, the Council of Europe legal order can no longer be confused with the traditionalinternational accord of juxtaposed national egoisms. Sovereignty is no longer an absolute given, as it wasin the Westphalian times, but an integral part of a human rights-serving community.In this context, the Convention cannot but be interpreted in the light of the formally binding “agreements”(i.e. treaties) and the immense plethora of formally not binding “common actions” performed by thepolitical and technical bodies of the Council of Europe, such as recommendations, guidelines anddeclarations of its Committee of Ministers. Furthermore, the Convention itself calls for an open-mindedapproach to international law and soft law, since it is inspired by the Universal Declaration on HumanRights, as the preamble states, and open to other legal instruments, both of domestic or international legalnature, when these offer a better human rights protection (art.53 of the Convention).24 In sum, the Court’sinterpretative latitude is dictated by the letter and the very nature and purpose of the Convention.The Convention “makes no distinction as to the type of rule or measure concerned and does not excludeany part of the Member States’ ‘jurisdiction’ from scrutiny under the Convention”.25 This means that theConvention is not subordinated to domestic rules, since it is the supreme law of the European continent.26Neither the supremacy of Parliament nor the independence of the judiciary may be invoked to fail toperform the Convention obligation of implementation of the Court’s judgments and decisions.27 As LadyHale wrote, “[i]t stands to reason that, once a state has committed itself to certain minimum standards, itcannot contract out of those by defining the terms used in its own way”.28As a matter of constitutional law, not even the core of the national constitution, where the politicalstakes are higher (such as the provisions on the composition of the highest political and judicial bodiesof the state), may be determinative in case of conflict with international obligations derived from the23On this principle see my separate opinions in Khamtokhu v Russia [GC] (App. Nos 60367/08 and 961/11), judgment of 24 January 2017, andGarib v Netherlands [GC] (App. No.43494/09), judgment of 6 November 2017.24On the “floor-ceiling problem” of the wide margin to leap ahead, but no margin to lag behind the Court, see my separate opinion in Hutchinsonv United Kingdom (App. No.57592/08), judgment of 17 January 2017.25Among many authorities, United Communist Party of Turkey v Turkey [1998] 26 E.H.R.R. 121 at [29], and more recently, Anchugov v Russia(App. Nos 11157/04 and 15162/05), judgment of 4 July 2013 at [50].26See Sejdić v Bosnia and Herzegovina [GC] (App. Nos 27996/06 and 34836/06), judgment of 22 December 2009 at [40]–[41]; Popescu v Romania(No.2) (App. No.71525/01), judgment of 27 April 2007 at [103]; and Anchugov (App. Nos 11157/04 and 15162/05) at [50]. The practice of theContracting Parties until at least the mid-1990s consistently confirmed this reading of the Convention. See the reform of the Maltese Constitutionfollowing the findings in the Demicoli v Malta judgment (Council of Europe Committee of Ministers Resolution DH (95) 211 of 11 September 1995)and the 14th Amendment of the Irish Constitution following the findings in the Open Door and Dublin Well Woman v Ireland judgment (Council ofEurope Committee of Ministers Resolution DH (96) 368 of 26 June 1996).27Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.28Lady Hale, “Common Law and Interpretation: the limits of interpretation” [2011] E.H.R.L.R. 538.Plaidoyer for the European Court of Human Rights 125[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsConvention and its Protocols.29 Any other approach, which pays lip service to the Court’s judgments anddecisions but ultimately rejects its legal force as res judicata among the parties and res interpretata forall Contracting parties, will breach the principle of pacta sunt servanda and the instrumental precept ofgood faith.30 As put in the Court’s “Memorandum to the states with a view to preparing the InterlakenConference”, delivered on 3 July 2009,“It is no longer acceptable that States fail to draw the consequences as early as possible of a judgmentfinding a violation by another State when the same problem exists in their own legal system. Thebinding effect of interpretation by the Court goes beyond res judicata in the strict sense. Such adevelopment would go hand in hand with the possibility for citizens to invoke the Convention directlyin domestic law (‘direct effect’) and the notion of ownership of the Convention by the States.”The Court’s task is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting Partiesto the Convention.31 Subsidiarity does not mean that the protection of human rights takes place primarilyat the national level in accordance with the Contracting Parties’ Constitutions and constitutional traditions,thus implying a limited, if not subservient role for the Court. Instead, subsidiarity means that theresponsibility to ensure Convention rights and freedoms falls primarily on the Contracting Parties. Effectivenational implementation of the Convention remains the sine qua non precondition for subsidiarity. At thisjuncture, it is not needed to recall the shameful examples in the history of Europe of gravely discriminatory,unjust and inhuman legislation and regulation being passed by democratically elected assemblies,governments and officials. Majorities can get it wrong. As an international court distanced from localpolitics, the Strasbourg Court is there to provide a legal avenue to the alleged victims of such wrongs.Against this background, no Contracting Party can legitimately claim special exemption from itsConvention obligations and the Court’s judgments on the basis of its “exceptional situation”, other thanin the strict terms of art.15 of the Convention. Even then that exemption is under the Court’s oversight.Outside of the very specific context of art.15, any possibility of democratic override of the Conventionobligations and the Court’s judgments is fundamentally inconsistent with the rule of law inherent in theConvention system and with the concept of the Convention as a charter of fundamental rights and freedomsand a “constitutional instrument of European public order”.325. The Court’s existential crisisThe unfortunate Hirst33 saga is a telling example of the current danger facing the European human rightsprotection system. The British legal framework imposed a blanket restriction on all convicted prisonersin prison. It applied automatically to such prisoners, irrespective of the length of their sentence andirrespective of the nature or gravity of their offence and their individual circumstances. Such a general,automatic and indiscriminate restriction on a vitally important Convention right, as the Court put it, mustbe seen as falling outside any acceptable margin of appreciation, however wide that margin might be, andas being incompatible with art.3 of Protocol No.1.Thirteen years have passed without implementation of the Hirst judgment delivered in 2004, thisomission being aggravated after 2010 by the delivery of a pilot judgment in Greens v United Kingdom.34In spite of the Court’s crystal clear indication that the disenfranchisement system of prisoners in the UK29 See Sejdić [GC] (App. Nos 27996/06 and 34836/06), judgment of 22 December 2009 for a case of conflict between constitutional provisions onthe composition of highest political bodies of the state and the European standards, and more recently Baka (App. No.20261/12), judgment of 23 June2016 on a case of conflict between constitutional provisions on the composition of the Supreme Court of Hungary and the Convention.30Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.31ECHR art.19.32 Loizidou v Turkey (preliminary objections) (1996) 21 E.H.R.R. 188.33Hirst v United Kingdom (No.2) (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 41.34Greens v United Kingdom (App. Nos 60041/08, 60054/08), judgment of 23 November 2010.126 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsconstituted a systemic failure which required the adoption of measures of general nature, none wereadopted even after the Grand Chamber itself nuanced the Court’s position in Scoppola v Italy in 2012.35In an exact similar case of automatic disenfranchisement as a result of a life sentence, without anyassessment of the individual case, the Grand Chamber backtracked from the principled position taken inHirst by accepting the Italian legislation depriving of voting rights automatically all those who are sentencedto three years or more in prison, irrespective of the nature of their offence and their individual circumstances.Despite the compounding circumstance that deprivation of voting rights could entail a life ban in Italy,while the UK deprived all persons sentenced to imprisonment, for the duration of their time in prison, theCourt found that the Italian system was indeed acceptable in the light of art.3 of Protocol No.1.Both the British rebellion against Hirst, and the Court’s backtracking from its own principles ofinterpretation, had and still have an enduring, negative effect on the European system of human rightsprotection.36 After the shock waves sent by the 2012 Konstantin Markin Grand Chamber case on the rightof servicemen to parental leave,37 which was felt as an interference with the organisation of the Russianarmy, the 2013 Anchugov judgment38 dealt with the exact same issue of Hirst, the ban of the voting rightsof prisoners, but this time with the particularity that the ban was based on a constitutional provision:art.32(3) of the Russian Constitution. That did not hinder the Court from repeating the finding of a violationof art.3 of Protocol No.1, which would logically entail a constitutional reform in Russia. No such thinghappened.On the contrary, in July 2015 the Russian Constitutional Court judgment on the Federal Law on theAccession of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights affirmed that a judgment ofthe Court is not enforceable in Russian territory if the Constitutional Court finds that it contradicts theRussian Constitution. Since there was no legal framework for such finding, the Constitutional Courtsuggested that the Duma approve legislation to create a special legal mechanism “to ensure the supremacyof the Constitution in the implementation of European Court of Human Rights judgments”.39 Suchinterpretation of the Russian Constitution was enshrined in December 2015 in a Law on the ConstitutionalCourt powers, which establishes the Constitutional Court power to declare rulings of international judicialbodies non-executable (including on compensation) if they contradict the Russian Constitution.40 In April2016, the Russian Constitutional Court applied the new law for the first time and decided that the Anchugovjudgment is not enforceable in Russia.41The 2016 Constitutional Court judgment only worsened the present existential crisis of the Court.42 Ifit is true that the vast majority of the Court’s judgments are implemented with more or less delay orprecision, the fact remains that in a fast-growing number of cases states are not willing to go along withthe Court and oppose directly or indirectly any kind of implementation of its judgments.43 In the case ofRussia, there are now 1,573 non-executed judgments pending,44 of them 204 in leading cases, among35 Scoppola v Italy (2013) 56 E.H.R.R. 19.36This is not the first time that this type of reaction occurs. One example suffices. Following theMcCann v United Kingdom judgment, the mediareported: “Ministers said they would ignore it and were not ruling out the ultimate sanction of a withdrawal from the court’s jurisdiction. ‘Every possibleoption is being kept open, including walking away,’ said one insider.” “Downing Street said the ruling in the so-called Death on the Rock case ‘defiedcommon sense’. Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine branded it ‘ludicrous’” (see Daily Mail, 28 September 1995). The novelty with the Hirstcrisis is the contagious effect that it had.37Markin v Russia (2013) 56 E.H.R.R. 8.38Anchugov v Russia (App. Nos 11157/04 and 15162/05).39Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation judgment No.21-P/2015 of 14 July 2015.40 See the Federal Constitutional Law No.7-FKZ of 14 December 2015, introducing amendments to the Federal Constitutional Law No.1-FKZ of21 July 1994 on the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation.41Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation judgment No.12-P of 19 April 2016.42On the impact of this crisis on the European human rights protection system see the European Commission for Democracy through Law (VeniceCommission) OpinionNo.832/2015 on the amendments to the Federal Constitutional Law on the Constitutional Court, 13 June 2016, CDL-AD(2016)016.43On the problems regarding the effectiveness of the Court raised by non-execution of its judgments, see among others Keller and Marti,“Reconceptualizing Implementation: The Judicialization of the Execution of the European Court of Human Rights’ Judgments” (2015) 26 E.J.I.L.829; and Hillebrecht, “Rethinking Compliance: The Challenges and Prospects of Measuring Compliance with International Human Rights Tribunals”(2009) 1 Journal of Human Rights Practice 362.44Data as of December 2017.Plaidoyer for the European Court of Human Rights 127[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorswhich the famous 2014 Yukos45 judgment that set the highest ever compensation amount in the history ofthe Court, €1.8 billion to be paid to the applicants. Precisely in this case, in January 2017 the RussianConstitutional Court came to the conclusion that the Court’s decision on just satisfaction violates theRussian Constitution and cannot be enforced.46In this context, it does not come as a surprise that even the binding force of a unanimous Grand Chamberjudgment (Paposhvili v Belgium47) has recently been rejected by the UKUpper Tribunal, which consideredthe Grand Chamber judgment as setting an “over-elastic and ill-defined” test which is “as long as thejudge’s sleeve”.48 The systemic effect of this crisis is evidently aggravated by the possibility of Brexit. Iffundamental rights in general and migration law in particular were main points of contention between theUnited Kingdom and the EU, leaving the EU will not be a solution, in view of the reciprocal influencebetween the Strasbourg and the Luxembourg jurisprudences on such issues like protection of the right toprivacy, mutual recognition of judicial decisions, procedural rights in criminal proceedings, guaranteesin asylum procedures or family reunification rights. If Brexit takes place, the dispute will be transposedto the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg Court will be the first to suffer.6. The institutional response to the crisisFaced with this adverse context, the Council of Europe should not ignore the critiques addressed to theCourt. A proactive stance is needed to reinforce the role of the Court in the European human rightsprotection system and protect it from undeserved criticism. Having had the benefit of serving the Courtfor six years now, it seems to me that the following steps should be taken in order to strengthen theindependence, the transparency and the accountability of the Court.The Court is a high-independence judicial body, because the judges are elected by a democratic assembly(the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe) for a long, non-renewable nine-year mandate49and benefit from functional immunity for speech and acts while discharging their duties.50 In terms of theirlegitimacy, the judges enjoy a broad European-wide political legitimacy, since the members of theParliamentary Assembly are representatives of the 47 national Parliaments of the Contracting Parties tothe Statute of the Council of Europe. This indirect political legitimacy of the Strasbourg judges is oftenforgotten.Yet both the internal and the external independence of the judges can be improved. As in manyConstitutional and Supreme Courts, there should be a rotation of the presidency of the sections of theCourt, combined with a reduction of the term of section presidents. Article 25(c) of the Convention providesthat the plenary Court shall “elect the Presidents of the Chambers of the Court” (who may be re-elected).In fact, the Court’s 47 judges are divided into five sections, within each of which three to four chambersare formed. The plenary elects the presidents of the five sections. The present Convention frameworkdoes not hinder the election of section presidents in accordance with a seniority-based system of voluntaryrotation. Such system would avoid the inconveniences of campaigning and lobbying for electoral postsand therefore better protect the internal independence of the judges.This new electoral philosophy should be articulated with a new voting philosophy. Pending casesshould only be discussed by the judges in the court room, and not externally. Rule 22(1) of the Rules ofCourt states: “The Court shall deliberate in private. Its deliberations shall remain secret”. Rule 28(2)(d)provides that: “A judge may not take part in the consideration of any case if he or she has expressedopinions publicly, through the communications media, in writing, through his or her public actions or45OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v Russia (2014) 59 E.H.R.R. SE12.46Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation Judgment No.1-P of 19 January 2017.47Paposhvili v Belgium [GC] (App. No.41738/10), judgment of 13 December 2016.48EA (Article 3 medical cases—Paposhvili not applicable) [2017] UKUT 00445 (IAC).49ECHR arts 22, 23.50ECHR art.51 and Statute of the Council of Europe art.40.128 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsotherwise, that are objectively capable of adversely affecting his or her impartiality”. These rules shouldbe reinforced by the adoption of a strict “rule of silence” outside the courtroom.The independence of the judges could be further strengthened with some fundamental ineligibilityrules. Judges should be ineligible to apply for posts within the Court Registry (which provides legal andadministrative support to the Court)51 for a period of five years after their mandate has ended; an equivalentrule should apply to Registry staff as regards applying for judicial posts at the European Court.Judges should also be ineligible to apply for certain state positions for a period of five years after theirmandate has ended; an equivalent rule should apply to the holders of those state positions as regardsapplying for judicial posts at the European Court. These “cooling-off period” rules would put an end toany risk of a “revolving door” between the Court and Government-dependent posts.52The Court is a high-transparency judicial body, because the Convention secures the right of judges tojoin separate opinions to Grand Chamber and Chamber judgments and advisory opinions.53 Nevertheless,the Court’s transparency could be further enhanced.The transparency of the Court relates essentially to the mode of constitution of the Chamber and theGrand Chamber for each case. With regard to the Grand Chamber, art.26(4) and (5) of the Convention iscomplemented by r.24 of the Rules of Court. Rule 24(e) provides:“(e) The judges and substitute judges who are to complete the Grand Chamber in each casereferred to it shall be designated from among the remaining judges by a drawing of lots bythe President of the Court in the presence of the Registrar. The modalities for the drawingof lots shall be laid down by the Plenary Court, having due regard to the need for ageographically balanced composition reflecting the different legal systems among theContracting Parties.”The practice has been that six “regional” groups are organised for the constitution of the Grand Chamberfor each case; these “regional” groups are reviewed from time to time and the individual judges are chosenfrom these “regional” groups by manual drawing of lots.With regard to the chambers and the sections, r.25(3) of the Convention is complemented by rr.25 and26 of the Rules of Court. Rule 25 of the Rules of Court on the “Setting-up of Sections” states: “Thecomposition of the Sections shall be geographically and gender balanced and shall reflect the differentlegal systems among the Contracting Parties [the term ‘Section’ is used instead of ‘Chamber’]”. Rule 26of the Rules of Court on the “Constitution of the Chambers” states: “1(b) The other members of theChamber shall be designated by the president of the section in rotation from among the members of therelevant section”. The practice has been that, after consultation with the individual judges, the Presidentof the Court proposes and the plenary ratifies the composition of sections. The constitution of the Chamberfor each case depends ultimately on the section president.These rules should be reviewed with a view to avoid any element of chance or discretion in thecomposition of judicial formations. Instead, there should be predictability and certainty, eliminating anyroom for doubt. The constitution of the Chamber and the Grand Chamber for each case should be determinedin accordance with strictly objective criteria and a fully automated, publicly available procedure.In accordance with a long-standing practice, judge rapporteurs are assigned anonymously to presideover the processing of each case. It is an open secret that the practice follows an internal rule accordingto which the national judge is the judge rapporteur in Chamber cases from his or her own country,54 save51ECHR art.24.52This would remove the risk to which is made reference in Dunoff and Pollack, “The Judicial Trilemma” (2017) 111(2) American Journal ofInternational Law 225, fn.102.53ECHR arts 45(2) and 49(2).54This is why applications are normally allocated to the Section in which the national judge sits. Rule 26(1)(a) of the Rules of Court provides thatin constituting Chambers to consider an application, where the national judge is not a member of the Section to which the application has been assigned,he or she shall sit as an ex officio member of the Chamber.Plaidoyer for the European Court of Human Rights 129[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorswhen the section president decides differently. In Grand Chamber cases, the President of the Court hastotal discretion in appointing the judge rapporteur.55 This practice should be changed.First, the Convention does not prevent the judge rapporteur from being identified. Secondly, rr.48–50of the Rules of Court are manifestly insufficient to ensure the needed institutional transparency, in viewof the utmost importance of the judge rapporteur’s input into the processing of cases. Thirdly, the applicants,the Governments, the lawyers and the general public have a right to know the identity of the judgerapporteur, in accordance with the overarching principle of transparency of the Council of Europe.56Hence,judge rapporteurs should be publicly named and their appointment should be based on strictly objectivecriteria and a publicly available procedure.The single judge may declare inadmissible or strike out of the Court’s list of cases an application underart.34 of the Convention.57 The single judge is assisted by a non-judicial rapporteur who shall functionunder the authority of the President of the Court.58 In practice, both the single judge and the non-judicialrapporteur are appointed by the President of the Court. Other than the restriction that a single judge shallnot examine any application against a country in respect of which he or she has been elected,59 the Presidentof the Court has full discretion in the appointment of the single judge and the non-judicial rapporteur.This should not be the case. The criteria for designating single judges and non-judicial rapporteurs toparticular countries should be objective and public. The mere fact that the single judge decisions arenon-appealable, final decisions60 warrants such objectivity and transparency. The additional fact that theyrepresent the vast majority of the Court’s output only shores up the argument for increased objectivityand transparency.The transparency of the Court’s output still leaves much to be desired.61 Separate opinions are a major,but still underestimated tool to guarantee the Court’s transparency and promote the development of itscase-law. Article 45 of the Convention does not hinder the identification of the majority and the minorityin decisions. Judges who form the majority and minority in decisions should be identified in order toclarify the position of each individual judge.62The practice of the Court has been open to separate opinions (on inadmissibility issues) joined to meritsjudgments which also incorporate inadmissibility decisions.63 Indeed, there is no reason why this practiceshould not extend to decisions as such. The omission in art.45(2) of the Convention of a reference todecisions is a mere historical accident, given the original competence of the Convention organs, whereadmissibility was essentially a matter for the Commission.64 Furthermore, r.74(2) of the Rules of Court55 Sometimes his or her identity is known (see Dzehtsiarou and Lukashevich, “Informed Decision-Making: The Comparative Endeavours of theStrasbourg Court” in (2012) 30(3) Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights 274, fn.10).56 See the “Guidelines for civil participation in political decision making”, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 27 September 2017 at the1295th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies. These Guidelines recommend increasing transparency of decision-making processes around Europe, andnamely that all public bodies responsible for decision making should be subject to access to information laws. See also the Parliamentary AssemblyResolution 2182 (2017) on “Follow-up to Resolution 1903 (2012): promoting and strengthening transparency, accountability and integrity of ParliamentaryAssembly members”, adopted by the Assembly on 10 October 2017.57ECHR art.27 and Rules of Court r.27A.58ECHR art.24(2).59ECHR art.26(3).60ECHR art.27(2).61Since this article is focused on institutional transparency reform efforts, it will not address substantive transparency issues related to the motivationof judgments, like the unpredictable use of the margin of appreciation and the distortion of the European consensus, regarding which the Court’spractice has been the subject of much criticism (see the interesting remarks of Strasbourg Judges on these issues in Dzehtsiarou, European Consensusand the Legitimacy of the European Court of Human Rights (Cambridge University Press 2015, ch.7), as well as Tulkens and Donnay, “L’usage de lamarge d’appréciation par la Cour européenne des droits de l’homme. Paravent juridique superflu ou mécanisme indispensable par nature?” (2006)Revue de Science Criminelle et de Droit Pénal Comparé 3, and Tulkens, “Conclusions Générales”, in Frédéric Sudre (ed.), Le principe de la subsidiaritéau sens du droit de la Convention européenne des droits de l’Homme (Anthemis, 2014)).62 Sometimes it is frustrating that a minority member of the judicial composition does not have the chance to dissociate him or herself from themajority, especially in cases coming from his or her own country of origin.63 See, among recent examples, the separate opinions joined by Judges Keller and Dedov in Navalnyye v Russia (App. No.101/05), judgment of 17October 2017, by Judges Karakas, Vucinic and Laffranque in Tibet Mentes v Turkey (App. No.57818/10), judgment of 24 October 2017, and my ownopinion in de Tommaso v Italy [GC] (App. No.43395/09), judgment of 23 February 2017.64As shown by the Court’s practice even during the time of the Commission (see Van Oosterwijck v Belgium (1981) 3 E.H.R.R. 557 and Cardot vFrance (1991) 13 E.H.R.R. 853).130 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorshas already gone praeter legem, by including the possibility of a “bare statement of dissent”. Mostimportantly, decisions on inadmissibility occasionally deal with complex, crucial issues which relate tothe Court’s jurisdiction and the interpretation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto. It is simplynonsensical that judges cannot express their individual views on issues of this magnitude in decisions onapplications under arts 33 and 34 of the Convention65 while decisions rejecting requests for advisoryopinions may be accompanied by separate opinions or statements of dissent.66Article 46(3), (4) and (5) of the Convention does not rule out separate opinions in interpretation andinfringement judgments. Yet r.93 of the Rules of Court prohibits such opinions in interpretation judgmentswhile r.99 does not prohibit them in infringement judgments. This groundless difference of treatmentshould be solved by bringing the erroneous r.93 into line with the open rule enshrined in art.46(4) of theConvention, read in conjunction with art.45(2).67Sufficient reasoning (which is not “stereotypical”) should be provided for single judge decisions oninadmissibility68 and for the decisions of the Grand Chamber panels that reject a case to the Grand Chamber69and these decisions should be published.70 These were the crystal-clear demands of the Governments inthe 2015 Brussels Declaration,71 after the criticism expressed by other national and international authorities72.Following the same logic, and since it deprives the parties of one degree of jurisdiction, any decision torelinquish in favour of the Grand Chamber should be reasoned.73All the sources of information relied on by the Court for the drafting of a judgment or decision shouldbe made public, including information provided by the Court’s Jurisconsult,74 international and comparativelaw reports of the Court’s Research Division and third-party interventions.75 One essential element for themotivation of the Court’s judgments is its internal guidelines on just satisfaction. There is no reason whythese guidelines should remain secret.76 The parties to the case have a right to know how the awarded justsatisfaction was calculated.77Scholarly research shows that normally there is an inverse relation between independence andaccountability of judicial bodies: more independence comes at the expense of less accountability.78 TheCourt is a low-accountability judicial body. Save for dismissal procedures when the judge no longer fulfilsthe “required conditions”79 and the prohibition of engaging in “any activity which is incompatible withtheir independence, impartiality or with the demands of a full-time office”,80 there is no other accountability65Rules of the Court r.56(1).66Rules of the Court r.88(2).67 In fact, the practice of the old Court admitted such separate opinions in interpretation judgments (see the separate opinion of Judges Verdross andZekia in Ringeisen v Austria (Interpretation) (1979) 1 E.H.R.R. 513).68ECHR art.27, in conjunction with art.45(1).69ECHR art.43(2) and (3). Rule 73(2) of the Rules of Court states that “Reasons need not be given for a refusal of the request”.70Rule 33(4) of the Rules of Court only provides for publication of “general information” on decisions taken by the single judge.71 See the High-level Conference on the “Implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights, our shared responsibility”, BrusselsDeclaration, 27 March 2015: “welcomes the intention expressed by the Court to provide brief reasons for the inadmissibility decisions of a singlejudge, and invites it to do so as from January 2016; invites the Court to consider providing brief reasons for its decisions indicating provisional measuresand decisions by its panel of five judges on refusal of referral requests”.72 SeeMaria Cruz Achabal Puertas v Spain , United Nations Human Rights Committee, Communication No.1945/2010, 18 June 2013, and myopinion in Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v Romania [GC] (App. No.47848/08).73Rule 72(3) of the Rules of Court provide for the opposite.74Rule 18B of the Rules of Court provides as follows: “For the purposes of ensuring the quality and consistency of its case-law, the Court shall beassisted by a Jurisconsult. He or she shall be a member of the Registry. The Jurisconsult shall provide opinions and information, in particular to thejudicial formations and the members of the Court”.75ECHR art.36 and Rules of Court r.44.76 See the CDDH Report on “the longer-term future of the system of the European Convention on Human Rights”, CDDH(2015)R84, AddendumI, 11 December 2015, p.83: “Regarding the issue of just satisfaction awarded by the Court, the CDDH considers that the criteria applied by the Courtneed to be more transparent”.77 In fact, the Court’s own case law imposes a very demanding transparency obligation on national courts (e.g. Ferreira Alves v Portugal (No.3)(App. No.25053/05), judgment of 21 June 2007 at [40]–[43]).78Dunoff and Pollack, “The Judicial Trilemma” (2017) 111(2) American Journal of International Law 225, 226.79ECHR art.23(4) and Rules of Court r.7.80ECHR art.21(3) and Rules of Court r.4.Plaidoyer for the European Court of Human Rights 131[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsmechanism for judges. With regard to the members of the Registry, the general disciplinary rules of theCouncil of Europe apply.81 But more could be done to make the Court accountable.The Court’s plenary is responsible for the most important decisions regarding the Court’s administrativeand managerial policy.82 The Bureau, which does not have a Convention footing, is an advisory body tothe President of the Court and does not have any decision-making power of its own.83 All judicial matterslay outside the scope of the advisory competence of the Bureau, which can only pronounce itself onadministrative and extra-judicial matters which fall within the competence of the Court’s President.84Hence, the Bureau’s task of facilitating coordination between the Court’s sections only contemplatesmatters of administrative and extra-judicial nature.85Any pronouncement of the Bureau on judicial matters,including case-law consistency, would be ultra vires.Prior to the adoption of the Council of Europe’s budget each year, a detailed annual report approvedby the Court’s plenary should be presented to the Committee ofMinisters and the Parliamentary Assemblyof the Council of Europe, with information on the past results and future, expected results, in accordancewith the Court’s administrative and managerial policy. Most importantly, the Contracting Parties shouldbe given more input into the adoption of the Rules of Court.86In line with the nature of the Convention as a “constitutional instrument of European public order”,87the focus of the Court’s administrative and managerial policy should be on inter-state cases andpilot-judgment procedures.88 Special human and financial resources should be allocated to these types ofcases. Among other strategic options to be taken, a “situation room” should be established within theCourt to provide centralised, internal supervision of the development and follow up to these cases. Thisshould be a high-ranking executive department that enables the Court to assess more efficiently thedevelopment of such cases and the impact of the respective judgments in cooperation with the Committeeof Ministers’ own supervisory mechanism.89More generally, the further judicialisation of the execution of the Court’s judgments, namely by meansof the increased use of the art.46(4) infringement procedure and the full acknowledgment of the right toreopen the case at domestic level after the Court’s finding of a Convention violation, is a crucial strategicstep that both the Court and the Committee of Ministers should envisage in order to be fully responsiveto recalcitrant states.9081 See “Staff Regulations of the Council of Europe”, arts 54–58.82ECHR art.25.83Rules of Court r.9A(3).84Rules of Court r.9A(3).85Rules of Court Rule r.9A(4) read in conjunction with the previous r.9A(3).86Rule 110 of the Rules of Court is manifestly insufficient in this regard.87 Loizidou v Turkey (preliminary objections) (1996) 21 E.H.R.R. 188 at [75].88Already the 2005 report Lord Woolf on the Review of the Working Methods of the European Court of Human Rights proposed that “Cases thatare candidates for a pilot judgment should be given priority, and all similar cases stayed pending outcome of that case”. See also the CDDH Reporton “the longer-term future of the system of the European Convention on Human Rights”, CDDH(2015)R84, Addendum I, 11 December 2015, p.82:“Concerning systemic issues, the CDDH supports wider use by the Court of efficient judicial policy and case-management, allowing effective adjudicationof large numbers of applications and inducing the respondent States through pilot judgments or other existing procedures to resolve the underlyingsystemic problems under the supervision of the Committee of Ministers.” The 2015 Brussels Declaration, cited above, supported “further explorationand use of efficient case-management practices by the Court in particular its prioritisation categories for the examination of cases, according to, amongother things, their level of importance and urgency, and its pilot-judgment procedure.” According to the Court’s priority policy, pilot-judgmentprocedures are Category II cases. But in its recent review of the priority policy, with effect from 22May 2017, the Court placed inter-state cases, whichwere hitherto in Category II, outside the priority policy “in view of their special character which in any event attracted special procedural treatment”(see “The Court’s Priority Policy”, available on the Court’s site).89This means that the treatment of repetitive cases once the pilot judgment is delivered should not be entirely de-judicialised. The strike-out judgmentdelivered in Burmych v Ukraine (App. Nos 46852/13 et al.), judgment of 12 October 2017 must be read in the light of the very special circumstancesof that case, to which the Grand Chamber repeatedly referred (at [174], [175], [181] and [199]).90See my separate opinion in Fabris v France (2013) 57 E.H.R.R. 19 on the legal and political importance of Article 46(4) infringement proceduresand see my separate opinion inMoreira Ferreira v Portugal (No.2) (App. No.19867/12) judgment of 11 July 2017, on the implementation ofRecommendation (2000) 2 on re-examination or reopening of certain cases at domestic level following judgments of the Court.132 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsAn accountability-based culture focused on producing a high-quality output, and not just statisticalresults,91 should pervade the Court’s administration and management. This is evidently only possible witha highly authoritative judicial body and a fully motivated and increasingly specialised Registry. Theelection of judges should involve an intensive public vetting process. A European-wide uniform vettingprocess should improve the already existing standards,92 both at the national and the international stages,including public interviews by the Parliamentary Assembly Committee on the Election of Judges to theEuropean Court of Human Rights. After being elected, judges have an accountability obligation also withregard to their private lives. There should be full publicity about the “off-the-bench” engagements ofjudges, including details about events sponsored by the Member States.The Registry is the backbone of the Court’s structure and contributes importantly to the quality of itsoutput. Article 25(e) of the Convention provides that the plenary Court shall elect the Registrar and DeputyRegistrar. This responsibility of the judges should be expanded to other positions of the Registry.

This article explores a number of questions raised by this proposal: As a matterof international law, can the UK “withdraw” from the Charter? Assuming it can, how could courts applythe underlying fundamental rights without reference to the Charter? Is it possible to disentangle “retainedEU law” from an instrument that reflects foundational values of the EU legal order? Can the EU and itsMember States enter into a withdrawal agreement that does not preserve Charter rights, at least for EUcitizens? If not, would it be sustainable for the UK to afford greater human rights protections to EUcitizens than it provides to its own citizens?IntroductionThe UK has embarked upon an unprecedented attempt to withdraw from the EU. The implications ofwithdrawal remain unclear in a number of areas, but one area in which the contours and challenges of thepost-Brexit world are beginning to emerge is in the area of human rights protections. As of the date ofwriting this article, March 2018, Parliament is considering a “European Union (Withdrawal) Bill”(Withdrawal Bill or the Bill). The current draft of the Bill proposes that, from the date of exit, the EuropeanCommunities Act 1972 would be repealed, but that EU law as it exists on the date of exit would beconverted into domestic law. There is, however, one notable exception to the proposed conversion of EUlaw into domestic law: art.5(4) of the Bill provides that: “[t]he Charter of Fundamental Rights is not partof domestic law on or after exit day”.1The aim of this article is to examine the proposal to abandon the Charter from the perspective ofinternational law, while also considering relevant aspects of EU law and domestic law. The article firstconsiders international law on withdrawal of treaties and on withdrawal of human rights protections andthe extent to which the EU Charter is a “treaty” to which such rules of international law apply. Secondly,the article considers the UK government’s depiction of the Withdrawal Bill as incorporating EU law asit existed on the day before exit in the light of the Bill’s exclusion of the Charter. Finally, it considers the* Scott Vesel is a Partner at the London office of Three Crowns LLP; Nicola Peart is a Barrister at the London office of Three Crowns LLP.

The fact that the EU Charter is not one of“the Treaties” to which art.50 applies highlights a more basic question: is the EU Charter “a treaty” at allto which international law on withdrawal applies?The official EUR-Lex database of European Union Law lists the Charter as one of four “Treatiescurrently in force”.7 Similarly, the Commission’s Draft Withdrawal Agreement classifies the Charter asone of “the Treaties” in its definition of “Union law”.8 However, the Vienna Convention defines a “treaty”by reference to three criteria: a “treaty” is (1) “an international agreement concluded between States”, (2)“in written form” and (3) “governed by international law”.9The Charter is certainly in written form, but it is unclear whether it meets the other two criteria. As tothe first criterion, the Charter began its life on 7 December 2000 as a “solemn proclamation” issued in2Article 54 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969.3 See Article 56(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969: “1. A treaty which contains no provision regarding its termination andwhich does not provide for denunciation or withdrawal is not subject to denunciation or withdrawal unless: (a) it is established that the parties intendedto admit the possibility of denunciation or withdrawal; or (b) a right of denunciation or withdrawal may be implied by the nature of the treaty.” Seee.g. Lord McNair, The Law of Treaties (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1961), pp.493–494: “Thus, the normal basis of approach adopted in the UnitedKingdom and, it is believed, in most States, towards a treaty is that it is intended to be of perpetual duration and incapable of unilateral termination,unless, expressly or by implication, it contains a right of unilateral termination or some other provision for its coming to an end. There is nothingjuridically impossible in the existence of a treaty creating obligations which are incapable of termination except by the agreement of all parties. Someexisting British treaties have endured for nearly six centuries, and many for three.”4UN Human Rights Committee, CCPR General Comment No.26 Continuity of Obligations CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.8/Rev.1 (9 December 1997),paras 1 and 3, http://www.refworld.org/docid/453883fde.html [Accessed 9 March 2018].

The Draft Withdrawal Agreement has been prepared by the European Commission Task Force for the Preparation and Conductof the Negotiations with the United Kingdom under Article 50 (“TF50”).9Article 2(1)(a) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969.Will the Fundamental Rights Enshrined in the EU Charter Survive Brexit? 135[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsNice by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, rather than as an agreement concludedbetween States.10 In this first iteration, the Charter was politically, but not legally, binding. As the Councildeclared when issuing its decision to create the Charter in June 1999, following this solemn proclamation,“[i]t will then have to be considered whether and, if so, how the Charter should be integrated into thetreaties”.11 The Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe would have incorporated the Charter as PartII of the EU Constitution,12 but that treaty never came into force. Subsequently, in June 2007 the Headsof State or Government of the EU Member States agreed to give the Charter legally binding force, andthe European Parliament passed a resolution approving the legally binding status of the Charter on 29November 2007.13On 12 December 2007 the Charter, as adapted with a view to making it legally binding,14was solemnly proclaimed anew by the European Parliament, Council and Commission.15 The EU Charterbecame legally binding through the Lisbon Treaty,16 which introduced into the TEU a provision stipulatingthat the Charter has the “same legal value as the Treaties”.17There are two ways of interpreting the effect of this provision. One could say that, by ratifying theLisbon Treaty, the Member States were also ratifying the Charter as a separate treaty on a par with theTEU and TFEU. This interpretation, however, is difficult to reconcile with the language of art.1 of theTEU, which defines “the Treaties” as referring only to the TEU and the TFEU. Article 50 only contemplatesthe possibility of withdrawal from “the Treaties” (the TEU and TFEU), such that if the Charter did becomea treaty by virtue of the Lisbon Treaty, it is outside the scope of the withdrawal provision in art.50 andthus would not cease to apply upon a Member State’s exit from the Union. However, if the parties to theLisbon Treaty had intended to make the Charter into a treaty, one might have expected them to include itwithin the definition ofLisbon Treaty itself (following the model of the draft EU Constitution) or at leastincluded it in the definition of “the Treaties” in art.1 of the TEU.Alternatively, the reference to the Charter having the “same legal value as the Treaties” can be seen asdoing no more than to signify the (now legally binding) Charter’s place within the hierarchy of sourcesof EU law.18 Such a reading is reinforced by the parallel language in art.1 of the Lisbon Treaty proclaimingthat the “two Treaties shall have the same legal value”.19 On balance, it seems that the best reading of thislanguage is that the Charter, while not technically a “treaty”, shall be treated within EU law as having thesame status as the TEU and TFEU.As to the third criterion under the Vienna Convention, it is unclear to what extent the Charter is “governedby international law” as distinct from EU law.If the Charter does not appear to meet the definition of a “treaty” under the Vienna Convention, doesthat mean that it can be freely abandoned? Or do the fundamental rights recognised in the Charter belongto persons within the territories to which such rights have extended, such that aMember State’s withdrawalfrom the EU would not deprive them of those rights?10Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000/C 364/01) of 18 December 2000.11European Parliament, Conclusions of the Presidency—Cologne European Council (3 and 4 June 1999), Annex IV European Council Decision onthe drawing up of a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/kol2_en.htm#an4 [Accessed 9March 2018].12 See Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe (2004/C 310/01) of 16 December 2004.13See European Parliament, Background Note, “EU Charter of Fundamental Rights—proclamation at Parliament in Strasbourg 12 December 2007”(29November 2007), p.3, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=IM-PRESS&reference=20071127BKG13869&language=EN [Accessed9 March 2018].14See “Charter of Fundamental Rights: the Presidents of the Commission, European Parliament and Council sign and solemnly proclaim the Charterin Strasbourg” (12 December 2007), http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-07-1916_en.htm?locale=en [Accessed 9 March 2018].15See Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2007/C 303/01) of 14 December 2007.

Thus, in its Opinion rejectingthe possibility of withdrawal from the ICCPR, the UN Human Rights Committee observed that21:“The rights enshrined in the Covenant belong to the people living in the territory of the State party.The Human Rights Committee has consistently taken the view, as evidenced by its long-standingpractice, that once the people are accorded the protection of the rights under the Covenant, suchprotection devolves with territory and continues to belong to them, notwithstanding change ingovernment of the State party, including dismemberment in more than one State or State successionor any subsequent action of the State party designed to divest them of the rights guaranteed by theCovenant.”This principle was invoked by the European Court of Human Rights in Bijelic v Montenegro and Serbia,where it referred to the Committee’s 1997 Opinion in support of the principle that “fundamental rightsprotected by international human rights treaties should indeed belong to individuals living in the territoryof the State party concerned, notwithstanding its subsequent dissolution or succession”.22As a threshold question, one might ask whether this principle applies with respect to the Charter incircumstances where art.51(1) of the Charter defines a limited scope for application of the Charter: it is“addressed … to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law.”23A partial answer might be found in the fact that the Charter proclaims its purpose as to “reaffirm… therights as they result” from other sources of law, including, inter alia, the constitutional traditions ofMemberStates, international law, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the European Social Charter,and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Union(CJEU). The Charter aims to “strengthen the protection of fundamental rights … by making those rightsmore visible” within the context of implementing Union law.24 The Human Rights Committee expresseda similar point when it explained that the ICCPR, together with the simultaneously prepared and adoptedInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, “codifies in treaty form the universalhuman rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights”.25 To the extent that the EU Charterreplicates fundamental rights rooted in other international human rights instruments, such rights arguablyequally belong to individuals within the UK, notwithstanding its withdrawal from the EU.However, this is an incomplete answer, as it ignores the fact that the Charter expands upon and enhancesthe protections for the fundamental rights it addresses.The European Parliament has recognised that this reaffirmation is accompanied by some innovation,in particular in the provisions on non-discrimination in art.21(1)26:20Article 3 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969: “The fact that the present Convention does not apply to international agreementsconcluded between States and other subjects of international law or between such other subjects of international law, or to international agreementsnot in written form, shall not affect: (a) The legal force of such agreements; (b) The application to them of any of the rules set forth in the presentConvention to which they would be subject under international law independently of this Convention; (c) The application of the Convention to therelations of States as between themselves under international agreements to which other subjects of international law are also parties.”21UN Human Rights Committee, CCPR General Comment No.26 Continuity of Obligations CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.8/Rev.1 (9 December 1997),para.4, http://www.refworld.org/docid/453883fde.html [Accessed 9 March 2018].

For instance, disability, age and sexual orientation are now explicitly mentioned as prohibitedgrounds of discrimination.”Indeed, a briefing paper prepared for the House of Commons highlighted other enhancements to humanrights protections provided by the Charter27:“Where the Charter applies, it provides more rights than ECHR claims under the Human Rights Act1988; for example:• a right to dignity (Article 1)• an express right to protection of personal data (Article 8)• rights of the child (Article 24)• a broader right to a fair trial (Article 47)A wider class of applicants can use it ….Stronger remedies are available.”One commentator identified four ways in which the Charter provides for broader rights protections,i.e.28:“First, the Charter provides specific protection for rights that are not currently clearly provided inthe ECHR. The clearest example of this is Article 8 of the Charter [on personal data] …Second, the Charter provides a clearer specification of rights which might be within the scope ofConvention rights or the common law, but where uncertainty persists both as to the existence of theright and its scope….Third, the Charter helps to condition the legislative process to be ‘rights-centric’, prompting andguiding legislation. This can be seen, for example, with regard to workers’ rights [Article 27] …Finally, unlike the Human Rights Act 1998 or the common law, the Charter sets a framework forthe interpretation of the rights it contains.”The Charter’s innovations and enhancements of human rights protections would be lost under thecurrently proposedWithdrawal Bill, which would direct UK courts to ignore the Charter and instead applythe underlying rights and principles when interpreting and applying retained EU law.29This prospect is, quite understandably, alarming to those within the UK for whom the Charter is presentlya key source of human rights protection.30A group of more than 20 organisations and human rights expertssigned an open letter highlighting that “[l]osing it creates a human rights hole because the Charter provides27A.

In light of art.51(1) of the Charter, its scope of application is more narrowly defined than aninstrument like the ICCPR. Furthermore, some of the rights—such as the rights to stand for election andvote in elections for the European Parliament—are plainly dependent on a constitutional architecture thatcould and would cease to apply after Brexit. Indeed the 1999 Cologne Council specifically emphasisedthat the Charter was intended not only to include general fundamental rights and freedoms and basicprocedural rights, but “should also include the fundamental rights that pertain only to the Union’s citizens”.37Thus, a more granular analysis of the particular right in question would be necessary to determine whetherthe right falls within the category of general fundamental rights or whether it is a right associated withEU citizenship. In this regard, the Commission’s Draft Withdrawal Agreement calls for the Charter to31 “EU Withdrawal Bill will not protect UK rights: open letter” (14 January 2018), Equality and Human Rights Commission, https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/our-work/news/eu-withdrawal-bill-will-not-protect-uk-rights-open-letter [Accessed 9 March 2018].32 J.

In light of the UK’s constitutional dualism,its courts have not traditionally been willing to directly apply human rights norms where they are notincorporated in domestic legislation. However, there are some recent hints at an openness to do so, includingon the basis of a legitimate expectation that international human rights norms once recognised by the UKwill be respected, regardless of whether they have been expressly incorporated into domestic legislation.39If the Charter is not included as part of the Withdrawal Bill, such allusions by the UK courts to thepersistence of certain fundamental human rights might be relevant in the context of challenging amendmentsto EU-derived law post-Brexit.EU law—can it be applied without the Charter?Even if one assumes that international law would permit the UK to abandon at least some of the Charter’sprotections post-Brexit, one must also consider whether it can be plausibly maintained that theWithdrawalBill would result in a situation where “the same rules and laws will apply on the day after the UK leavesthe EU as before”,40 given that the Bill would strip out the Charter from the laws and rules that applied onthe day before exit.Article 51 of the Charter declares the Charter’s provisions to be “addressed … to the Member Statesonly when they are implementing Union law”.41 The CJEU has emphasised that “the requirements flowingfrom the protection of fundamental rights in the Community legal order are also binding onMember Stateswhen they implement Community rules”.42 In short, as a matter of EU law it is clear that the Charter’sprovisions are binding whenever EU law and rules are being applied.The Explanatory Notes to theWithdrawal Bill declare its effect as being to “convert EU law as it standsat the moment of exit into domestic law” albeit “subject to some limited exceptions”43—the two principal“limited” exceptions being (1) that “[t]he principle of the supremacy of EU law does not apply to anyenactment or rule of law passed or made on or after exit day”,44 and (2) that “[t]he Charter of FundamentalRights is not part of domestic law on or after exit day”.4538Article 122(1) of the Commission’s Draft Withdrawal Agreement of 28 February 2018: “Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, Unionlaw shall be applicable to and in the United Kingdom during the transition period.

(SG) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2015] UKSC 16 at [246] stating that: “The propositionthat the doctrine of legitimate expectation can generate a right to rely on the provision of an unincorporated treaty in the interpretation and applicationof domestic law is, at least, controversial.

By converting the EU acquis into UK law, those underlying rights and principles willalso be converted into UK law, as provided for in this Bill. References to the Charter in the domesticand CJEU case law which is being retained are to be read as if they referred to the correspondingfundamental rights.”The assertion with which this explanation begins appears to be based on the Preamble to the Protocolon the Application of the Charter to the UK and Poland, which contains the following statement47:“WHEREAS the Charter reaffirms the rights, freedoms and principles recognised in the Union andmakes those rights more visible, but does not create new rights or principles.”Whatever legal effect this preambular language may have,48 it does not alter the text of the Charter, nordoes it make a party’s invocation of a right under the Charter conditional upon that party demonstratingthat the right or principle in question is not a new one.In any case, the focus in the Explanatory Notes on distinguishing between existing and new rightsignores the Charter’s impact on the scope of existing rights as well as the means by which they can beenforced. Notably, while a Charter right may at present form the basis of a cause of action in UK domesticcourts, general principles may not of themselves provide any right of action—a point upon which the Billwould remove any doubt by stipulating that “[t]here is no right of action in domestic law on or after exitday based on a failure to comply with any of the general principles of EU law”.49The approach reflected in the Bill generates a host of questions. The confusion is only exacerbated bythe discrepancies in the way the UK government has explained how the Bill is supposed to work. Forexample, the UK government’s more recent “Right by Right” analysis of the Charter asserts that, whenconsidering a non-discrimination claim, the UK courts post-exit “will be required to interpret retained EUlaw consistently with Article 21(1) [of the Charter]so far as it reflects a general principle of EU law”.50This latter affirmation, however, is inconsistent with the language of art.6 of the Withdrawal Bill, whichdefines “retained general principles of EU law” specifically to exclude the Charter.51The only way that a Charter right might sneak into “retained EU law” is through the back door of Sch.1para.2 to the Bill, which calls upon courts in the UK to recognise as general principles of EU law onlythose that have been recognised as such by the CJEU prior to exit day.52 But as one commentator hasnoted, “[i]t is not entirely clear in how far all Charter rights also exist as general principles” and “not allrights contained in the Charter have so far been dealt with in the CJEU’s case law”.53 The House of Lords46Department for Exiting the European Union, European Union (Withdrawal) Bill Explanatory Notes (18 January 2018), para.103.47 Protocol on the Application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to Poland and to the United Kingdom, Official Journalof the European Union (C-306/156) of 17 December 2007.48 If the Charter were a “treaty”, then such language would form part of the “context” for interpreting the treaty under art.31(2) of the ViennaConvention.49 Schedule 1, para.3(1) to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill of 18 January 2018.50Department for Exiting the European Union, Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU: Right by Right Analysis (5 December 2017), p.40, https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/664891/05122017_Charter_Analysis_FINAL_VERSION.pdf [Accessed 9March 2018].51Article 6(7) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill of 18 January 2018.52 Schedule 1, para.2 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill of 18 January 2018.53T.

The Court of Justice of the EuropeanUnion (CJEU) often refers to both the general principles and the Charter in support of the samehuman right. This may also result in greater uncertainty.”All of this places post-exit UK courts in a difficult position. Where are courts to look to find thesefundamental rights if not to the Charter? Andwhen a court is required to interpret an underlying fundamentalright whose scope has been expanded by the Charter, is a court to ignore the Charter in interpreting thescope of the right? Is a court to read precedents applying the Charter as if those precedents were applyingthe underlying fundamental right instead?It is doubtful whether such an approach would be faithful to the case-law of the CJEU. As one CJEUjudge has explained56:“[R]eferences to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter have not only become currentpractice in the jurisprudence but are also a necessary element of the interpretation and the applicationof European provisions…. References made in the jurisprudence to the guarantees of fundamentalrights are not simply ornamental. They influence the process of interpretation, of determination ofthe very content of particular norms, their extent and legal consequences, and thus they provide forthe enlargement of the field of application of the European rules in the national legal orders.”It is also doubtful whether such an approach would be practicable. To illustrate the difficulty, considerthe CJEU’s decision on the right to be forgotten in the Google case. In that decision, the CJEU describedthe right to privacy as amongst “the general principles of law whose observance the Court ensures andwhich are now set out in the Charter”,57 but the Court went on to decide the relevant issues by referenceonly to “fundamental rights under Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter”.58 Fast-forward to a time after March2019: how is a post-Brexit UK court supposed to separate the “general principle” that it must apply fromthe Charter right that it must ignore? Or consider two cases on discrimination on the basis of sexualorientation. In its recent judgment in the Walker case, the UK Supreme Court upheld claims ofdiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by reference to the relevant Directives and generalprinciples of EU law, concluding that “non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is now aprinciple of EU law” without ever referring to the Charter or its non-discrimination provision in art.21(1).59Conversely, the recent Opinion of the Advocate General in the Coman case considers a claim ofdiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation solely through the lens of the Charter, in particularart.21(1), without uttering the phrase “general principle”.60 It would be absurd if the existence or scope ofrights in the UK post-Brexit were to depend upon such vagaries as whether a particular court decision54House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution, European Union (Withdrawal) Bill—9th Report of Session 2017–2019 (28 January 2018),paras 108–114, https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldconst/69/69.pdf [Accessed 9 March 2018].55Constitution Committee,Written evidence from Professor Alison Young, University of Oxford (EUW0003) (August 2017), http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/constitution-committee/european-union-withdrawal-bill/written/69634.html [Accessed9 March 2018].56M.

This risks causing legal confusion in a context where clarity isneeded.”Thus, the effect of the Bill’s exclusion of the Charter appears to be that retained EU law will be appliedonly by reference to the underlying rights and principles without reference to any innovations orclarifications as to the scope of those rights and principles contained in the Charter. Such a result isincompatible with EU law existing prior to exit, which plainly requires compliance with the Charterwhenever applying EU law and rules. Thus, contrary to the affirmation in the Explanatory Notes, it is notthe case that, without the Charter, “the same rules and laws will apply on the day after the UK leaves theEU as before”.64 The EU negotiators have signalled in art.4 of the Commission’s Draft WithdrawalAgreement that they will not accept the Charter-free regime contemplated by the current Withdrawal Billbut rather are likely to insist that, to the extent EU law is to be applied in the UK after withdrawal, suchlaw must produce “the same legal effects” and “be interpreted and applied in accordance with the samemethods and general principles” as in any other Member State, including by ensuring “conformity with”CJEU decisions issued before the end of the transition period and by giving “due regard” to post-transitionCJEU decisions.65Can the representatives of the EU agree to terms of withdrawal under which theCharter would cease to apply in the UK?Article 50 of the TEU contemplates a negotiated withdrawal under which “the Union shall negotiate andconclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangement for its withdrawal, taking account ofthe framework for its future relationship with the Union”.66The TEU and its art.50 are plainly “Union law”, and thus when implementing art.50, the institutionsand bodies of the Union as well as theMember States are bound to “respect the rights, observe the principles61S.

TheEuropean Parliament adopted a resolution on 5 April 2017 declaring that “the withdrawal agreement mustbe in conformity with the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, failingwhich it will not obtain the consent of the European Parliament”.68 Specifically, the European Parliamentdemanded that EU-27 citizens living in the UK retain “protection of the integrity of Union law, includingthe Charter of Fundamental Rights, and its enforcement framework”.69 The European Commission’s“Guiding Principles for the dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland” have similarly noted that 70:“The Good Friday Agreement requires equivalent standards of protection of rights in Ireland andNorthern Ireland. The United Kingdom should ensure that no diminution of rights is caused by theUnited Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, including in the area of protection againstforms of discrimination currently enshrined in Union law.”Member States are also raising questions about how their Charter obligations will affect their cooperationwith the UK post-Brexit if the Charter is abandoned. For example, on 1 February 2018 Ireland’s SupremeCourt referred a question to the CJEU as to whether it should refuse extradition to the UK because ofuncertainty about whether the appellant’s rights, including under the Charter, will be capable of enforcementafter Brexit.71Citizens are raising questions as well: a Dutch court has referred to the CJEU the questionof whether the UK’s withdrawal will lead to the automatic loss of EU citizenship rights for UK citizensliving in the Netherlands.72According to the negotiating parties’ joint report, the withdrawal agreement will indeed cover certain“citizens’ rights”, including the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and of UK citizens living in theEU.73 At the time of writing, the negotiating parties have agreed that the terms of withdrawal agreementwill provide for certain family members joining EU citizens living in the UK “on the same conditions asunder current Union law”.74 This will be enacted in new UK domestic legislation,75 providing not only thatsuch citizens’ rights can be directly invoked in UK domestic courts, but that domestic law that is“inconsistent or incompatible [with the Withdrawal Agreement] … will be disapplied”.76 Moreover, toensure consistent interpretation and application of citizens’ rights, both parties envisage the possibility ofUK courts referring questions on interpretation to the CJEU.77By permitting entry to EU citizens’ family members “on the same conditions as under current Unionlaw” (and for the lifetime of the right holder), is the UK not also committing to do so in conformity with67Article 51(1) of the EU Charter.68European Parliament Resolution 2017/2593(RSP) of 5 April 2017 on negotiations with the United Kingdom following its notification that itintends to withdraw from the European Union, para.16, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&language=EN&reference=P8-TA-2017-0102 [Accessed 9 March 2018].69European Parliament Resolution 2017/2593(RSP) of 5 April 2017 on negotiations with the United Kingdom following its notification that itintends to withdraw from the European Union, para. 18—a position that has since been reflected in the Commission’s Draft Withdrawal Agreement,at least through the end of the transition period..70European Commission, Task Force for the Preparation and Conduct of the Negotiations with the United Kingdom under Article 50 TEU, Guidingprinciples transmitted to EU27 for the Dialogue on Ireland/Northern Ireland (6 September 2017), p.4, https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/guiding-principles-dialogue-ei-ni_en.pdf [Accessed 9 March2018]. ].

If the answer to these questions is “yes”, can the UKGovernment realisticallymaintain a post-Brexit scenario where EU citizens living in the UK are granted a greater scope of humanrights protections under the EU Charter, while UK citizens are not?ConclusionThe Withdrawal Bill’s proposal to exclude the entirety of the EU Charter from the body of EU law thatis to be retained and converted into domestic law raises a host of legal and practical difficulties—and isantithetical to the terms of the Commission’s Draft Withdrawal Agreement. The current draft of the Billwould not only reduce the scope of human rights protections available in the UK, but would also createsignificant legal uncertainty as to the scope of those protections, which in turn would be likely to spawna wave of litigation in the course of which the courts will face the impossible task of trying to remove theCharter egg from the omelette of retained EU law.In any event, there is a significant likelihood (if not already apparent) that the EU negotiators willconsider themselves to be legally prohibited from accepting any withdrawal agreement that does notrespect the Charter, in particular in relation to the rights of EU citizens in the UK. It is not inconceivablethat the exclusion of the Charter from retained EU law could lead to a future in which EU citizens in theUK enjoy Charter protections that are denied to other residents of the UK.Will the Fundamental Rights Enshrined in the EU Charter Survive Brexit? 145[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsA Nightmare on Downing Street: Brexit Reachesthe CJEUElif Mendos Kuşkonmaz*PhD student, Queen Mary University of LondonBrexit; Citizenship; EU nationals; European Court of Justice; Extradition proceedings; Fundamentalrights; JurisdictionAbstractThis article explores two recent referrals made by two different Member States’ national courts to theCourt of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the impact the UK’s withdrawal from the EU has onEU citizenship and fundamental rights. The key concern in both referrals is that the terms of there-arrangement of the UK’s future relationship with the EU are unclear and variable depending on theway the withdrawal negotiations might ensue. As this article argues, the application of fundamental rightscontained in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the jurisdiction of the CJEU will be the mostcrucial and sensitive issues in such re-arrangement. Thus, the CJEU’s involvement through the preliminaryruling procedure will provide a legal clarity on the matter.IntroductionSince the UK’s referendum on leaving the EU, the relationship of the UK with the EU has been sweptinto a political whirlpool. As the negotiations for disentangling the UK from the EU and for rearrangingtheir future relationship progress in slow-motion, resentments over the destabilising impact of the UK’swithdrawal from the EU (i.e. Brexit) has become louder. Key concern amongst others is that Britishnationals and EU citizens will be devoid of essential protection that they have enjoyed under the rubricof EU law.The recent CJEU referrals by twoMember States’ national courts cast light on this concern in particular,and the legal uncertainties surrounding Brexit in general. One referral concerns a legal challenge by Britishnationals living in the Netherlands on the continuity of their EU citizenship rights despite Brexit.1 Otherreferral relates to whether a Member State that has received a request for surrender of suspects and/orconvicts by the UK under the specific EU surrender system must execute this request given that the CJEUjurisdiction and the EU fundamental rights architecture that underpin this system will lapse in the UKupon Brexit.2 These referrals converge on the UK’s treatment of the CJEU and the rights protection afterBrexit, and thus require attention in relation to the existential question of the rights landscape of the UKpost-Brexit. Whilst so far this question has been unravelled as a political matter, the CJEU’s involvementis a great opportunity to have legal clarity in the field. This is of great importance for safeguardingindividuals’ rights despite the political ambiguity surrounding the Brexit negotiations. Moreover, theCJEU might be able to set out the legal matters upon which the negotiators must engage in Brexit.*The author is indebted to the reviewers for their valuable suggestions.1ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:605, https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:605 [Accessed 9 March 2018].

It exploresthe implications of Brexit on EU citizenship rights and on EU extradition law, respectively. Each sectionconsiders the political discourse in the corresponding matter, the background to the referrals concerned,and the key concerns on fundamental rights protection.On EU citizenship rightsSince it was first introduced in the Maastricht Treaty, anyone who is a citizen of an EU Member Stateshas been considered as the citizen of the EU.3Article 20(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EuropeanUnion (TFEU) reaffirms the legal construction of EU citizenship as follows: “[c]itizenship of the Unionis hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of theUnion. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship”.4 Thus, EUcitizens are entitled to enjoy the associated rights coupled with the EU citizenship including the right tomove and reside freely within the EU,5 the right to vote,6 the right to petition the European Parliament,7and the right to call for new EU legislation.8Article 20(1) of the TFEU is the key to understanding the Dutch District Court’s referral to the CJEU,which is discussed further below. To date it has invoked different approaches to EU citizenship. Oneapproach is that EU Member State citizenship is a prerequisite for EU citizenship, and thus depriving aperson of the former means the termination of the latter.9 This approach is current in many reports on theconsequences of Brexit on the EU citizenship rights of British nationals.10Another approach to this statement is that Member State citizenship is a gateway to the EU citizenship,but the latter can be detached from the former.11 This point is justified by the reading of the last statementas merely retaining Member States’ responsibility of designating their citizens, and thus providing adistinction between two identities: Member State citizenship on the one hand, and the EU citizenship onthe other, by allocating the former within the competence of EU Member States and the latter within thecompetence of the EU.12 As discussed below, the second approach is now being tested before the CJEUthrough the Dutch Court’s referral on the meaning of art.20 of the Treaty post-Brexit.The general assumption is that that once the UK leaves the EU, the EU citizenship of British nationalsceases to exist.13 Therefore, after Brexit, they will become third-country nationals under EU law becausethe UK will no longer be part of the Union. They will have to adhere to third-country national rules underEU law and national immigration laws of the EUMember State in areas which have not been harmonised.In this regard, EU measures on third-country nationals might be considered as a layer of protection forBritish nationals after Brexit when compared with more demanding UK immigration rules that the EUnationals must adhere to.

The uncertainty and legal vagueness surrounding the citizenship rights’dialogue might affect the life that they had planned in the UK or in an EU Member State.This uncertain climate provided the impetus for the legal challenge before the Dutch Court, leading toa referral to the CJEU on the legal status of the British nationals post-Brexit. Before considering thisreferral, the following section gives a snapshot of the current negotiations (as of March 2018) on the statusof citizenship rights post-Brexit because it tells the political side of the matter.Political discourse on the status of EU citizenship post-BrexitThe political tide of the impact of Brexit over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and the Britishnationals living elsewhere in the EU has been incoming since the June 2016 referendum. The first informalconsensus over the issue materialised in December 2017 in a joint report to the European Council wherebythe negotiators of the EU and the UK set forth a basis for a future withdrawal agreement.17 In general, thereport freezes the rights of EU citizens living in the UK by the cut-off date (probably 29 March 2019) andthose of British nationals living elsewhere in the EU by the same date.18 It also preserves the rights associatedwith the EU citizenship of their family members as defined in the Citizenship Directive residing in thehost state by that date.19 The corollary impact of the joint report’s personal scope is that the EU citizensand British nationals who arrive in the UK or any EU Member States after the cut-off date, and certainright-holders under EU law such as family members as defined under the Free Movement of WorkersRegulation20 will not preserve the rights conferred them under EU laws.21 The status of the EU citizens orBritish nationals who arrive during the transitional period is still a controversy.22 Additionally, the statusof British nationals working at the EU institutions (in Brussels, or wherever they are based) post-Brexithas not been touched upon yet.23Equally important is how the Joint Report envisages the CJEU jurisdiction for citizens’ rights afterBrexit. This is of particular relevance in relation to how the EU (Withdrawal) Bill deals with the same14One example is the rules on the family reunification, whereby British nationals must meet the income threshold and their third-national familymembers must pass the language and integrations tests.

In this regard, the UK courts maintain their option to resort to the CJEU for the interpretationof those rights for a period of eight years starting from the application of the citizens’ rights provision(notice that it is not the withdrawal date, supposedly in the hope of referring to a transition period).24 Theymust also pay “due regard” to the decisions of CJEU, including those decided after Brexit for an unlimitedtime, whereas they may consider the post-Brexit decisions.25The joint report gives an initial insight into the possible direction towards which the WithdrawalAgreement might go. That said, its restricted personal scope comes as a set-back for those who wouldwant to join their family members in the UK or in the EU. In this regard, spouses, registered partners,children, and dependent partners who reside outside either the EU or the UK may join the EU citizen inthe UK, or British national in the EU, on the condition that they are related to them on the withdrawaldate.26 This means that those who are not related to an EU citizen or British national must jump the hoopsof national laws in order to join their family members in either any EU Member State or the UK.27The Withdrawal Agreement proposed by the European Commission on 28 February 2018 translatesthe political deal on the citizenship rights as underlined in the joint report into legal language.28 Whilstmaintaining a large portion of the report in general, it adds new issues in relation to the citizenship rightsthat are subject to further negotiation. One issue stands out as particularly important for the rights of Britishnationals who have been living in EU Member States: they will lose their right to free movement to otherMember States, right of establishment in another Member State, right to provide services on the territoryof another Member State, and right to provide services to a person established in another Member Stateafter the transition period. However, it is yet to be seen whether the UK agrees to the EuropeanCommission’s proposal on citizenship rights. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the drafting of theWithdrawal Agreement will go smoothly, particularly in relation to the Northern Ireland borders and thefinancial settlement. Another point is that the UK Government might agree on a withdrawal insofar it issatisfied with any future arrangement it might make with the EU including the future relation of theUK-EU. Otherwise, it might leave the table without a deal (a so-called ‘Hard Brexit’ scenario). Amidstall these uncertainties, the legal character of EU citizenship under art.20 of the TFEU was referred to theCJEU in the hope that the Court will provide at least a degree of legal certainty to this unchartered Brexitterritory.The decision by the Dutch District CourtFive British nationals living in the Netherlands along with the Commercial Anglo Dutch Society and alobby group, Brexpats—Hear Our Voice, sought referral to the CJEU by the Dutch Court on the legalstatus of the EU citizenship after Brexit.29 The crux of the matter was that the joint report was of a politicalnature, and thus the claimants will be stripped of their EU citizenship rights, unless the EU and the UKnegotiators agree on the terms for safeguarding those rights.30 Therefore, they question the consequencesof Brexit for their rights derived from art.20 of the TFEU. In considering the claimants’ arguments, theDutch Court made certain observations; (i) the political negotiation process does not make the legal24 Joint Report, para.38.25 Joint Report, para.38.26 Joint Report, para.12(a).27 It is sufficient to note here that the Family Reunification Directive sets the minimum rules in family reunification except for UK, Ireland andDenmark, who opted out of this Directive.28TF50 (2018) 33—Commission to EU 27.29ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:605 https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:605 [Accessed 9 March 2018].

The first view considers that the EU citizenship is bound to theMember State citizenship by an umbilical cord. In this regard, the UK’s withdrawal from the EU meansthe removal of EU citizenship from the UK national as the UK will no longer be part of the EU.37The second view heavily relies on the argument that the Member State citizenship is a gateway, but nota condition for the EU citizenship.38 Seen from this perspective, it is necessary to detach EU citizenshipfromEUMember State citizenship in amove towards finding a European community within the continent.39According to this view, the case-law of the CJEU justifies dissociating EU citizenship from nationalcitizenship in a series of cases where it has constrained the Member States’ measures in deprivingindividuals of their citizenship rights in order to protect the EU citizenship.40 For example, in Rottmann,a German citizen was faced with denaturalisation due to his failure when naturalising to provide informationon the criminal investigations against him in Austria. He was originally an Austrian national at birth, buthis naturalisation application in Germany caused him to lose his Austrian nationality under Austrian law.41Thus, his loss of German citizenship meant that he would be wholly deprived of EU citizenship. TheCJEU decided that state measures revoking a person’s citizenship are subject to judicial review in lightof EU law, and thus must not substantially affect the enjoyment of EU citizenship.4231ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:605, para.5.9.32ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:605, para.5.10.33ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:605, paras 5.12–5.14.34ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:605, paras 5.19–5.21.35ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2018:605, paras 5.19–5.21.36Loic Azoulai, “The (Mis)Construction of the European Individual: Two Essays on Union Citizenship Law” (2014), EUI Department of LawResearch Paper No.2014/14.37Ronan McCrea, “Brexit EU Citizenship Rights of UK Nationals and the Court of Justice” (8 February 2018), UK Constitutional Law, https://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2018/02/08/ronan-mccrea-brexit-eu-citizenship-rights-of-uk-nationals-and-the-court-of-justice/ [Accessed 9 March 2018].38Dawson and Augenstein, “After Brexit: Time for a further Decoupling of European and National Citizenship” (14 July 2016) Verfassungsblog.On the different scopes of the EU citizenship and EU Member State citizenship see Dimitry Kochenov, “Ius Tractum of Many Faces: EuropeanCitizenship and the Difficult Relationship Between Status and Rights” (2009) 15 The Columbia Journal of European Law 171.39Dawson and Augenstein, “After Brexit: Time for a further Decoupling of European and National Citizenship” (14 July 2016) Verfassungsblog.40Mario Vicente Micheletti v Delegación del Gobierno en Cantabria (C-369/90), 7 July 1992; Janko Rottman v Freistaat Bayern (C-135/08), 2March 2010.41 Janko Rottman v Freistaat Bayern (C-135/08) at [26].42 Janko Rottman (C-135/08) at [48].150 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsIn fact, the Dutch Court’s referral invokes the second view and questions whether the CJEU canmaintainits stance towards the idea that the EU citizenship is “destined to be the fundamental status of nationalsof theMember States, enabling those who find themselves in the same situation to enjoy the same treatmentin law irrespective of their nationality”.43 Still, the question is then whether the observations in Rottmanncan be expanded to the rights of the British nationals after Brexit. That said, the facts of Rottmann arerather different from those in Brexit. The latter does not concern the revocation of British nationality, butrather withdrawal from the EU as a result of which British nationals are stripped of their EU citizenshipen masse. Still, this does not mean that the issues raised in the referral are redundant. Instead, the peculiarityof the case necessitates legal clarification by the CJEU; something that the negotiators have not providedto either British nationals or EU citizens.There are other issues regarding the Dutch Court’s referral that are worth mentioning here. The firstissue is that, as mentioned earlier, Brexit will affect many British nationals who do not currently live inan EU Member State. As the facts of the referral relate only those who reside elsewhere in the EU, thequestion is whether the CJEU will deal with them and those who do live in the UK differently. A merereading of the first question in the referrals, which is concerned with automatic loss of EU citizenshipupon Brexit, might suggest that in theory the CJEU might not do so because the issue relates to the legalstatus of EU citizenship in EU Treaties. However, the second question adds some uncertainty to thisanticipation because the unofficial English translation refers to the possibility of engaging upon aproportionality analysis of restrictions on the maintenance of the rights and freedoms to be derived fromEU citizenship. This statement might be interpreted to support arguments that only British nationals whoexercised their rights deriving from EU citizenship (e.g. those who reside in the EU) can keep their EUcitizenship rights after Brexit.The second issue is that if the CJEU accepts the applicant’s arguments and engages upon disentanglingEU citizenship from national citizenship, this might undermine the reciprocity principle for the EU citizensliving in the UK.44 According to this scenario, British nationals will benefit more than EU citizens livingin the UK from the outcome of the referral post-Brexit.Be that as it may, it is impossible to ignore the possible litigation against the Withdrawal Agreementitself before the CJEU if such an Agreement is to be reached by the EU and the UK negotiators. In thisregard, the litigation against the Withdrawal Agreement can ensue in two ways. The first way is to relyon art.263 of the TFEU, whereby the EU institutions’ and bodies’ actions are subjected to judicial review,in order to adjudicate the decisions on signature and approval of the Withdrawal Agreement.45 The secondway is that the European Parliament can ask the opinion of the CJEU on theWithdrawal Agreement underart.218(11) of the TFEU before making a decision on its conclusion.46 The European Parliament haspreviously showed its active involvement in the negotiations of international agreements, and thus it mightshow its political influence in finalisation of the Withdrawal Agreement.4743Rudy Grzelczyk v Centre public d’aide sociale d’Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve (C-184/99), 20 September 2001 at [31].44 For this view see McCrea, “Brexit EU Citizenship Rights of UK Nationals and the Court of Justice” (8 February 2018) UK Constitutional Law.45Adam Lazowski, “Withdrawal from the European Union and Alternatives to Membership” (2012) 37(5) European Law Review 523 at 528.46Lazowski, “Withdrawal from the European Union and Alternatives to Membership” (2012) 37(5) European Law Review 523 at 528. Article 50refers solely to art.218(3) as the procedure for the conclusion of theWithdrawal Agreement, which raises doubts as to whether the European Parliamentcan indeed invoke the opinion procedure under para.11 of the same article.47The examples include the European Parliament’s rejection of the agreement signed between the US and the EU on the transfer of financialinformation, its referral to the CJEU of the agreement signed between Canada and the EU, of the draft agreement for EU accession to the ECHR, andof the free-trade agreement with Singapore.

This might also result in possible interferenceswith British nationals’ human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. Those rights arethe right to privacy as safeguarded under art.8 of the ECHR, the prohibition against discrimination underart.14 of the ECHR, and the right to property under art.1 of the First Protocol of the ECHR (A1P1 ECHR).An interference with art.8 of the ECHR (even if not a violation) might occur if the deportation of Britishnationals from the EU and EU citizens from the UK affects family unity.48 Another situation that mightgive right to the application of art.8 is where the loss of citizenship has an impact on the social identityof the individual, as was considered in the European Court of Human Rights’ Kurić decision concerningcitizens of the former Yugoslavia being removed from the register.49 The Court considered that art.8protects an individual’s right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings, and“sometimes embrace aspects of an individual’s social identity”.50 Thus, “it must be accepted that the totalityof social ties between settled migrants and community in which they are living constitute part of theconcept of private life within the meaning of Article 8”.51 On the basis of these observations, the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights found that Slovenia was in breach art.8 rights by withdrawing the applicants’legally established residence rights in Slovenia under the then Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavialaws. Along the same lines, when giving evidence before the UK House of Lords EU JusticeSub-Committee, Alegre made reference to Genovese decision to justify this view.52 Accordingly, in thisdecision, the European Court of Human Rights held that the “impact [of the denial of citizenship] on theapplicant’s social identity was such as to bring it within the general scope and ambit of [art.8 of theECHR]”.53 Although these examples relate either to residence status (i.e. Kurić), which can be settledunder theWithdrawal Agreement, or to the withdrawal of national citizenship (i.e.Genovese), they indicatepossible art.8 breaches due to the loss of EU citizenship.As regards the non-discrimination clause under art.14 of the ECHR, the most compelling argumentcame fromAlegre in her evidence before the UKHouse of Lords EU Justice Sub-Committee.54Accordingly,certain British nationals are able to acquire the citizenship of other EU Member States, and thus EUcitizenship without having to reside there through national naturalisation rules which may be predicatedon the nationality of the grandparents, nationality of the spouses, or financial investment.55 This, in turn,taken together with art.8 may breach the prohibition on discrimination on the ground of “national or socialorigin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status”.56Additionally, the right to property enshrined under A1P1 ECHR might be invoked to protect tangibleand intangible property acquired in the EU including entitlements to non-contributory social securitybenefits.57The above-claimed violations may be able to be invoked before the European Court of Human Rightsby British nationals and EU citizens affected by Brexit if no satisfactoryWithdrawal Agreement is reached.48 Jeunesse v Netherlands (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 17; Tuquabo-Tekle v Netherlands (App. No.60665/00), judgment of 1 March 2006.49Kurić v Slovenia (App. No.26828/06), judgment of 13 July 2010.

Thus, a challenge on the incompatibility of the Withdrawal Agreement with thefundamental rights as safeguarded under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (Charter) can be broughtbefore the CJEU. The Court has already had the opportunity to reject an international agreement due toits incompatibility with the Charter.58 Therefore, to the extent that Charter rights overlap with the ECHRrights mentioned above, the foregoing findings might be relevant for the CJEU’s interpretation of thematter.59 The UK side might gnash its teeth over the CJEU’s adjudication on the Withdrawal Agreementitself because no matter how insistent it tries to be in ending the CJEU jurisdiction in the UK post-Brexit,the Court will retain an important role in the composition of the Agreement.60Certain other issues remain over the extent which British nationals can retain their rights accompaniedwith their EU citizenship status. The first issue relates to the fact that the EU citizenship includes certainrights that are not expressly recognised by the ECHR such as the right to work, right to retire, and accessto the healthcare in the EU.61 The second issue concerns the UK Government’s insistent redline in endingthe jurisdiction of the CJEU in the UK, as mentioned earlier. The implications of this redline are dealtwith in more detail below in the section on the consequences of Brexit for EU surrender procedures.Consequently, a fundamental question in relation to the Dutch District Court’s referral is whether andhow the CJEU will answer the questions referred and ruffle feathers over the meaning of EU citizenshipin the Brexit scene. Needless to say, the CJEU has shaped the EU policy-making process over the yearsthrough its decisions.62 Therefore, there are reasons to assume that whether or not it declares the existenceof a European identity by detaching EU citizenship from national citizenship, if the CJEU accepts thereferral, it will certainly make an interesting judicial contribution to the debate on the post-Brexit legalstatus of millions of British nationals.On extraditionThe 2002 Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant simplified the procedure for surrender ofsuspects or convicts of criminal offences amongst EUMember States by introducing the European ArrestWarrant (EAW) system.63 What makes this system different to extradition outside the EU is that a MemberState authority who receives a surrender request under the EAW in principle must execute this requestwithout litigation within 60 days or, in some exceptional cases, 90 days.64 This could be done through theapplication of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions, according to whichMember Statesmust enforce and execute decisions of each other’s authorities despite procedural differences amongsteach other.65 In this regard, it creates a single area wherein Member States are banned from refusing tosurrender their own nationals.66 That said, facilitating a simplified surrender procedure amongst MemberStates as such must not encroach upon fundamental rights of individuals. Therefore, the EAW is rootedin the assumption that Member States participating in the EAW adhere to the Charter, to general principles58Opinion 1/15 (C-1/15) (Grand Chamber) 26 July 2017.59CFEU art.52(3).60The UK Government’s stance towards the CJEU jurisdiction is illustrated in the White Paper, which mentions the plans “to bring an end to thejurisdiction in the UK of the Court of Justice of the European Union”.

Thesechanges led the Irish High Court to refuse the surrender of the suspect to Poland and to refer the case tothe CJEU, asking whether systemic breaches of the rule of law as a result of those changes would meanthat the mutual recognition principle upon which the EAW request had been made is no longer operative.The UK re-joined the EAW system in December 2014 following its block opt-out from pre-Lisboncriminal and policing measures in accordance with Protocol 36 of the TFEU.69 It has praised the systemin numerous occasions and has approached the acceptance of the supervisions of the CJEU as a trade-offfor the greater good of the system.70 The figures on the surrender requests from and to the UK in the2010–15 period shows that the UK surrendered around 1,000 people every year to other Member Statesand requested around 100 people from them.71Once the UK’s membership to the EU ceases to exit, it will not be able resort to the EAW system. Thismeans that in principle the extradition process between the UK and the remaining EUMember States willrevert to being slower and more cumbersome when compared with the EAW system. In principle, the UKcan conclude an agreement with the EU on extradition matters, but EU Member States can still refuse toextradite their own citizens. There might also be certain limitations for an EU Member State wishing toextradite citizens of remaining EU Member States. As in Petruhhin, if a Member State bans extraditionof its own citizens outside the EU, it has to ask the remainingMember States whose citizenship the subjectof extradition request holds, before extraditing him or her to third country.72These issues raised concerns from the UK side over the continuity of its cooperation with the EU inthe fight against terrorism and serious crime.73 The number of extradition requests made by the EUMemberStates to the UK suggests that there is a mutual interest in an unhindered extradition process which currentlyassists the timely administration of justice.74 Lengthier and harder extradition procedures might also affectindividuals’ interests and pre-trial detention might be longer when compared with detention periods underthe EAW.Political discourse on extradition post-BrexitThe UK’s departure from the EAW as a consequence of Brexit raises two fundamental questions: (i) howshould the pending EAWs be treated; and (ii) how can the extradition be carried out after Brexit? Concernsover the former question was echoed in the updated text of the draft Withdrawal Agreement, accordingto which Member State can refuse the surrender of their own nationals to the UK during the transitional67EAW Framework Decision, art.1(3).68Minister for Justice and Equality v Artur Celmer [2018] IEHC 119.69House of Commons, Select Committee on European Scrutiny Committee, The UK’s 2014 Block Opt-Out Decision session 2013–14, para.1.70European Union Committee, “Brexit: judicial oversight of the European Arrest Warrant”, (HL 2017–19 (6)), para.12.71National Crime Agency, Historical European Arrest Warrant Statistics 2004-May 2016 (Calendar and Fiscal year) (May 2016) http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/publications/european-arrest-warrant-statistics/historical-eaw-statistics/693-historical-european-arrest-warrants-statistics-calendar-and-financial-year-totals-2004-may-2016 [Accessed 9 March 2018].72Aleksei Petruhhin v Latvijas Republikas Generalprokuratura (C-182/15), 6 September 2016.73 “European Arrest Warrant ‘absolutely essential’, Amber Rudd confirms” (7 March 2017), Holyrood, https://www.holyrood.com/articles/news/european-arrest-warrant-absolutely-essential%E2%80%99-amber-rudd-confirms [Accessed 9 March 2018].74 “Brexit & the European Arrest Warrant: How Will Change Affect the Interest of Citizens” (20 November 2017) ECAS, http://ecas.org/european-arrest-warrant-brexit/ [Accessed 9 March 2018], pp.6–7.154 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsperiod.75 The future relationship between the UK and the EU on extradition remains another mystery. TheUK Government has been vocal in its insistence on the continuation of cooperation with the EU on thisfield post-Brexit.76 Different scenarios for the future cooperation such as negotiating bilateral agreementswith each remaining Member State, falling back to the Council of Europe’s extradition mechanism (i.e.the 1957 European Convention on Extradition), or negotiating an agreement with the EU mirroring theEAW system.77 The prototype for the latter is the agreement signed between the EU and Norway/Iceland,which includes a modified version of the EAW system. However, there are reasons to argue that thissolution will not be an easy one because it took over 10 years to conclude this agreement and it is not yetin force. The Council of Europe’s extradition mechanism might not be a good solution either, because itwill be lengthier and more cumbersome when compared with the EAW system.78The UK Government’s persistent rejection of CJEU jurisdiction and of the application of the Charterafter Brexit sits at odds with its position to continue cooperation in extradition under an EAW-likearrangement. This is because judicial authorities in Member States are considered as equal and asfundamental-right compliant by virtue of the application of mutual recognition in criminal matters. Thus,the CJEU is the final arbiter through the preliminary ruling procedure if a dispute arises on the executionof an EAW. For this reason, discussions on judicial oversight of any possible UK-EU extraditionarrangement have surfaced in the UK side, acknowledging the tension that the UK Government’s redlineof the CJEU jurisdiction post-Brexit creates for the continuity of an EAW-like extradition arrangement.79Moreover, cutting the ties with the Charter might be detrimental to fundamental rights protection in theUK post-Brexit for two reasons. The first reason is that, as mentioned earlier, it is the source for ensuringthe rights of suspects and convicts under the EAW system. The second reason is that, as discussed below,the Charter potentially has a wider spectrum in comparison with the ECHR. Thus, this additional protectioncan only be enforced before the CJEU. In fact, this tension was the main reason why the Irish SupremeCourt referred questions to the CJEU on Member States’ possible refusal to execute the ongoing EAWsissued by the UK. So the dispute is whether, and if so how, the EU fundamental rights of an individualbe guaranteed in the UK if the imprisonment will end at a time when the UK is no longer part of the EU.The decision by the Irish Supreme CourtThomas O’Connor was convicted of tax fraud in the UK in 2001. He fled to Ireland while he was on bail.This led the UK to issue an EAW to Ireland for his surrender to serve his time and possibly to subject himto more charges in relation to his flight to Ireland.80 The applicant argued that Ireland was asked to surrenderan EU citizen to a country which might become a third country before he serves his time there. Therefore,depending on how the arrangements for the ongoing EAW procedures might evolve between the UK andthe EU, he might not be able to enjoy his Charter rights.81 This point was of particular relevance in decidingwhether the time he spent in custody in Ireland could be deducted from his imprisonment time in the UKshould the EAW is found to be invalid; a point that calls the application of EU law in question. However,if this point is raised before the UK courts after the withdrawal date, they might not be entitled to refer itto the CJEU.82 In this regard, the applicant argued that either his surrender to the UK was impossible or75TF50 (2017) 33/2—Commission to UK.76European Union Committee, “Brexit: future UK-EU security and police cooperation” (HL 2016–17, 77), para.141.77European Union Committee, “Brexit: judicial oversight of the European ArrestWarrant”; “Brexit Briefing No.2—The implications for extradition”(13 July 2016), 6KBW College Hill, http://www.6kbw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/6KBW-College-Hill-Brexit-Briefing-No.2.pdf [Accessed 9March 2018]; Steve Peers, “EU Referendum Brief 5: How would Brexit impact the UK’s involvement in EU policing and criminal law” (21 June2016), EU Law Analysis, http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/eu-referendum-brief-5-how-would-brexit.html [Accessed 9 March 2018].78European Union Committee, “Brexit: judicial oversight of the European Arrest Warrant”, para.71.79European Union Committee, “Brexit: judicial oversight of the European Arrest Warrant”, para.4.80O’Connor [2018] I.E.S.C. 3 at [5.8].81O’Connor [2018] I.E.S.C. 3 at [5.9].82O’Connor [2018] I.E.S.C. 3 at [5.14].A Nightmare on Downing Street: Brexit Reaches the CJEU 155[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorshe can be extradited insofar as the UK’s future arrangements with the EU on the extradition ensures EUrights that the applicant would have enjoyed if the UK had not withdrawn from the EU including the rightto take complains before the CJEU.83Having acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding any arrangement and 20 other similar cases on EAWsissued by the UK to Ireland before it, the Irish Supreme Court referred the case to the CJEU and askedwhether or not the receiving country can refuse to extradite the subject of an EAW.Fundamental rights in the UK post-BrexitThe referral by the Irish Supreme Court illustrates the controversy surrounding the UK Government’sstance in ending the CJEU jurisdiction and the applicability of the Charter after Brexit. According to theEU (Withdrawal) Bill, the existing case-law stays binding upon UK courts under certain exceptions.84 Forexample, the Supreme Court, Parliament, or the executive can depart from the CJEU precedent.85 UponBrexit, however, the CJEU jurisdiction in the UK comes to an end, and the UK courts will not have toconsider the post-Brexit case-law of the CJEU.86 However, the UK courts have the option to take thiscase-law into account if they find it appropriate to do so.87 This option, on the other hand, was not welcomedby the UK judges, who asked for more clarity on the extent of their discretion on the matter.88Clearly, the state of the CJEU jurisdiction under the EU (Withdrawal) Bill is different from how it wasenvisaged in relation to EU citizenship rights under the joint report, according to which the UK courtscan refer a case to the CJEU for a period of eight years starting from the application of the citizens’ rightsprovision and can take “due regard” to the CJEU case-law without a time-limit.As mentioned above, alternatives to the CJEU jurisdiction in order to keep an EAW-like partnershipwith the EU have been circulating in the UK side. Until an official consensus is reached on the matter,the CJEU jurisprudence will cease to apply in the UK upon Brexit, and EU citizens will not be able toenforce their rights under the Charter, as anticipated in the Irish Supreme Court’s CJEU referral. Thismeans that the general status of the fundamental rights protection in the UKmight be at risk after Brexit.89Another source of EU law that the UK Government wants to eliminate is the Charter, and this cut-offis materialised in the EU (Withdrawal) Bill.90 So, one out of the three current sources will be removedfrom the architecture of UK fundamental right protection (the other two sources are the common law, andthe ECHR as brought into UK law through the Human Rights Act 1998). What this means for rightsprotection in the UK is that individuals will not enjoy the wider protection that the Charter potentiallyoffers in certain areas when compared with the ECHR. Particularly in the field of extradition, the Charteroffers more detailed rights in the context of criminal matters than the ECHR.91 For example, the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights does not consider the extradition process as a criminal procedure, but rather anadministrative procedure, and thus it does not afford the minimum fair trial rights listed in art.6 of theECHR unless the subject of an extradition request “has suffered or risks suffering a flagrant denial of afair trial in the requesting country”.9283O’Connor [2018] I.E.S.C. 3 at [5.17].84EU (Withdrawal) Bill cl.6.85EU (Withdrawal) Bill cl.6(4).86EU (Withdrawal) Bill cl.6(1).87EU (Withdrawal) Bill cl.6(2).88 “UK’s new supreme court chief calls for clarity on ECJ after Brexit” (5 October 2017), The Guardian, https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/05/uks-new-supreme-court-chief-calls-for-clarity-on-ecj-after-brexit [Accessed 9 March 2018].89Equality and Human Rights Commission, Opinion on EU (Withdrawal) Bill—EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (5 January 2018), https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/eu-withdrawal-bill-legal-advice-jason-coppel-qc.pdf [Accessed 9 March 2018].90EU (Withdrawal) Bill cl.5(5).91Extradition procedure might rise possible interferences with the Charter’s art.47 on the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, art.48 onthe presumption of innocence and right of defence, art.49 on the legality and proportionality of criminal offences and penalties, and art.50 on the rightnot to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same criminal offence.92 Soering v United Kingdom (1989) 11 E.H.R.R. 439 at [113].

The corollary impact of this risk for the subjects of ongoing surrender proceduresunder the EAW system is that they might be stripped of their fundamental rights if they are surrenderedto and imprisoned in the UK after the UK’s withdrawal date. The legal framework for the transition periodand the future arrangements between the EU and the UK on the mattermight ensure the protection of theirrights, but this is purely at the mercy of the political blinking game. Thus, the outcome of the referralmight serve as a reminder on the importance of ensuring fundamental rights protection in the UKpost-Brexit.ConclusionAs of 29 March 2017, the Brexit ship sailed into unchartered waters. There is a plethora of issues to beresolved—from security to business and to immigration. This article aims to touch upon the issue of theimplications of Brexit for the UK’s fundamental rights landscape. It has looked at two recent CJEU referrals(as of March 2018); one on the implications of Brexit on the EU citizenship rights, and the other one onits implication on the ongoing extradition procedures. The first referral raises questions about the legalnature of EU citizenship in the EU Treaties, and tests the possible detachment of that citizenship fromnational citizenship. In this sense, it can be seen as inviting a resurgence of the concept of EU citizen asa commitment to the EU community. The second referral relates to the possible effect on ongoing extraditionrequests by the UK. In this regard, it provokes a discussion as to the extent to which the fundamentalrights protection in EU law can be guaranteed in the UK post-Brexit.The themes of both referrals have been touched upon, to some extent, in the political arena. Still, thelegal uncertainty in these themes persist, and thus this makes the CJEU referrals all the more fundamental.Both referrals converge on the status of the jurisdiction of the CJEU jurisdiction post-Brexit and thepotential impact of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on fundamental rights. Ironically, it has now madeit the CJEU’s role to determine these Brexit issues from a legal point of view, which will inevitably haveeffect on how they will be built into the withdrawal arrangements. These referrals are a clear lesson thatthe UK’s withdrawal from the EU necessitates not only a political but also a thorough and complex legalanalysis.A Nightmare on Downing Street: Brexit Reaches the CJEU 157[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe Trade Union Act 2016, the European Courtof Human Rights and the “right to strike” underArticle 11 of the European ConventionCharles BarrowUniversity of BrightonBallots; EC law; Freedom of assembly and association; Human rights; Justification; Margin ofappreciation; Proportionality; Strikes; Trade unionsAbstractThe Trade Union Act 2016 adds to the regulation of industrial action by introducing several new provisionsto restrict lawful picketing and implements further stringent restrictions on the organisation of strikeballots, such as by enforcing new minimum turnout and threshold requirements. This article examinesEuropean Convention principles on a trade union’s right to take strike action (now implicit within art.11)with reference to this statute—which supplements the detailed and complex requirements trade unionsmust already adhere to in order to call lawful industrial action. Drawing on a review of jurisprudenceconcerning other signatory states and the suitable application of Convention doctrines (such as the“margin of appreciation”) this article demonstrates that these highly restrictive provisions aredisproportionate limitations without contemporary justification under art.11(2). This analysis is undertakenin the context of the Strasbourg Court’s inconsistent and, at times, unwarranted and dismissive approachto trade union cases concerning the United Kingdom.IntroductionArticle 11(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights provides that “Everyone has the right … tofreedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protectionof his interests”. Article 11 case-law holds that protection extends beyond a mere right to join a tradeunion but also encompasses a number of freedoms including a right of a trade union to make representationsto an employer on behalf of the membership1; a right for trade union members not to be discriminatedagainst by an employer2 and a right to engage in collective bargaining.3 The Strasbourg Court has alsonow formally accepted that a “right to strike” is within the scope of trade union rights under art.11.4Legal action at the European Court of Human Rights challenging the UK’s strike law as contrary toConvention rights, has however, so far yielded scant satisfaction for trade unions. The Strasbourg Courthas failed to directly adjudicate on this question, arguably due to an inflexible application of the admissibilitycriteria, or has not effectively applied Convention principles to the UK legal framework—acknowledged1National Union of Belgian Police v Belgium (1975) 1 E.H.R.R. 578; Swedish Engine Drivers’ Union v Sweden (1976) 1 E.H.R.R. 617.2Wilson v United Kingdom (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 20.3Demir v Turkey (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 54.4Enerji Yapi-Yol Sen v Turkey (App. No.689591), judgment of 21 April 2009; RMT v United Kingdom (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 10; Hrvatski lijecnickiSindikat v Croatia (App No.36701/09), judgment of 27 February 2015.[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors158to be the most restrictive on strike action in Europe.5 For example, in NURMT v United Kingdom6(RMTv United Kingdom), the admissibility criteria was used in order to strike out a claim that the ballotingrequirements (which a union must follow prior to taking industrial action) were incompatible with art.11.The union (after earlier strike action had been subject to an injunction) had eventually complied with thestrict balloting rules and had successfully called the industrial action. The Court held that as the unionhad been able to take action, the application was “manifestly ill-founded” pursuant to art.35(1)(b)—as itdid not demonstrate a potential violation of Convention rights. The Court failed to take into account thatthe delay (caused by having to comply again with the detailed balloting provisions) adversely impactedon the union’s campaign and that the union incurred additional substantial financial costs—both examplesof interference with the “right to strike” guaranteed by art.11. 7A failure to comply with procedural criteria was also the cause of rejected applications in Roffey vUnited Kingdom8 and Prison Officers’ Association v United Kingdom(POA v United Kingdom).9 In POAv United Kingdom a claim that an outright ban on strike action by prison officers’ was in breach of art.11was rejected on the basis that a similar complaint had been submitted in 2004 by the POA to theInternational Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Freedom of Association Committee alleging the ban was abreach of ILO Convention 87. Article 35(2)(b) of the European Convention provides that an applicationto the European Court that is substantially the same as an earlier claim submitted to a different competentjudicial international body for adjudication is inadmissible unless there is new relevant information—suchas where there are new parties affected by the restriction. The complaint failed on these grounds eventhough the new applicants were not parties to the original ILO application and were directly affected bythe measure as individual union members and employees. The Strasbourg Court took the view that, asthey were also local (unpaid) officials, they were sufficiently closely associated with the earlier proceedingsthrough their trade union links—despite the fact that the ILO action was of a purely collective nature,taken solely by the union many years earlier.10InRoffey v United Kingdom11 the union initiated industrial action in April 2010. The employers respondedby penalising those on strike with a loss of non-contractual discretionary travel privileges. The unionlodged a claim in December 2010 that the state’s failure to provide a remedy for the imposition of sanctionsshort of dismissal (the loss of travel benefits) during an industrial dispute constituted an unjustified violationof art.11. The Strasbourg Court found the application inadmissible on the grounds that the applicationwas out of time—it was made after the six-month time limit contained in art.34(1)—which runs fromwhen the date of the interference with Convention rights occurred. It determined that this was from thedate when the applicants were informed of the withdrawal of their travel benefits, in April 2010, at thebeginning of the main industrial action. The Court failed to take into account that the violation was not aone-off event but a continuing interference, with the travel benefits not being restored until after thesettlement of the dispute in July 2011.12Where an application overcomes these procedural hurdles the European Court has not always appliedConvention principles consistently to prima facie evidence of violations of art.11. In RMT v United5As Tony Blair commented in an interview with The Times on 31 March 1997, “Let me state the position clearly, so that no-one is in doubt. Theessential elements of the trade union legislation will remain. The changes we propose would leave British law the most restrictive on trade unions inthe western world.”6RMT (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 10.7For further analysis of this case, see C. Barrow, “RMT v United Kingdom [2014]: The European Court of Human Rights Intimidated into Timidityor Consistent in its Inconsistency” [2015] E.H.R.L.R. 277.8Roffey v United Kingdom (App No.1278/11), decision of 21 May 2013.9POA v United Kingdom (App No.5925/11), decision of 21 May 2013.10 It was also arguable that the ILO’s Freedom of Association Committee was not a competent judicial body for these purposes (relating to anapplication of art.35(2)(b)) as its decisions were unenforceable and not binding on state actors.11Roffey (App No.1278/11), decision of 21 May 2013.12The application in Brough v United Kingdom (App No.52962/11), decision of 30 August 2016—alleging that the lack of statutory protection forthose workers “blacklisted” by employers was a violation of art.11—was also declared inadmissible as “out of time” even though the applicant hadsought to exhaust his domestic remedies during the relevant time frame.“Right to strike” under art.11 of the EU Convention 159[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsKingdom13 the Court had declared that although art.11 did encompass a right to strike, an absolute ban onsecondary action was within the state’s “margin of appreciation” and therefore a “proportionate” restrictioneven though there was little evidence to justify such an extensive ban and it was not in conformity withEuropean labour standards or with instruments of relevant international labour law.14This rather sorry recent record of Strasbourg adjudication on UK strike law has emboldened theConservative administration to argue that the additional limitations on industrial action introduced by theTrade Union Act 2016 are in full compliance with Convention standards.15 This statute further complicatesthe balloting procedure a union must undertake prior to taking strike action by, for example, introducingnew stringent turnout requirements and by imposing additional restrictions on peaceful picketing; allprovisions that are, prima facie, in violation of art.11(1). Under art.11(2) the “right to strike” may berestricted where it is “… necessary in a democratic society… for the protection of the rights and freedomsof others”. The terminology “… necessary in a democratic society” has been interpreted to imply thatintervention can only be permitted under art.11(2) if it meets a “pressing social need”—which involvesa balancing of competing interests and an examination as to whether the state’s intervention goes no furtherthan is necessary to meet that need—i.e. it is a proportionate response to the legitimate objective pursued.16This test is met if the new restrictions are a balanced, measured and proportionate means of securing thepolicy objectives behind the legislation. As the provisions of the Trade Union Act 2016 plainly interferewith a trade union’s right to take industrial action under art.11(1), it is arguable that significant reasonswould therefore need to be established to justify these measures.The picketing provisionsAn enduring feature of strike action is that those who are engaged in such action will seek to persuadeothers to support them or join them so as to enhance the effectiveness of the strike. As picketing inevitablyconflicts with the interests of other parties (such as employers, working employees, and where there isdisruption to public order, members of the public) picketing has always been subject to control by thecriminal and civil law. Criminal charges can be brought against pickets, for example relating to obstructionof the highway or offences under the Public Order Act 1986 (relating to disorder on a picket) or unders.241 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Consolidation Act 1992 (TULR(C)A 1992) (relating tointimidation and other miscellaneous offences). Civil liability may followwhere the pickets are trespassingor committing a nuisance. The undue application of existing criminal and civil restrictions may well haveimplications for compliance with the requirements of art.10 (on freedom of speech) as well as art.11 ofthe Convention.17Of particular relevance to industrial action is the tort of inducing breach of contract, which occurs whenpicketing successfully discourages workers from attending their place of work in breach of their employmentcontract. Picketing may also interfere with commercial contracts, where, for example, lorry drivers arepersuaded not to deliver to the employer; resulting in a breach of a commercial contract of supply betweenthe supplier of goods and the employer who is the target of the action. Trade unions and individual picketsonly have immunity from these civil actions if they comply with the conditions outlined in s.220 of theTULR(C)A 1992—that the picketing relates to a “trade dispute” and the pickets attend “at or near” theirworkplace in order to peacefully communicate or obtain information or persuade others not to work.13RMT (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 10.14 See also Unite v United Kingdom (App No.65397/13), decision of 26 May 2016. This case concerned the abolition of the Agricultural WagesBoard that promoted and supported collective bargaining in the agricultural sector. The application was struck out as inadmissible on the grounds thatabolition did not prevent the union from exercising its right to engage in voluntary collective bargaining—even though the relevant employers hadsteadfastly refused to do so.15 The Trade Union Bill: European Convention on Human Rights Memorandum (BIS/15/415, July 2015), pp.4–7.16On the interpretation of the expression “necessary in a democratic society” in the industrial context, seeWilson v United Kingdom (2002) 35E.H.R.R. 20 and ASLEF v United Kingdom (App. No.11002/05), judgment of 27 February 2007.17An analysis as to what extent the picketing sanctions are in breach of art.10 goes beyond the scope of this article.160 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsSection 10 of the Trade Union Act 2016 strengthens these conditions by inserting a new s.220A intothe 1992 Act, introducing several new provisions pickets and unions must meet before the immunityapplies. A union must now appoint a “picket supervisor”18 who has responsibility for managing the picketline; with the functions of the supervisor outlined in the re-issued Picketing Code of Practice.19 The unionmust take reasonable steps to ensure the police are informed of the supervisor’s name and contact detailsand location of the picket line.20 The picket supervisor (who must be an official or member of the union)should be present at the picket line or be readily contactable by the police or union to attend the picket atshort notice and be in possession of a letter from the union confirming that the picketing is approved bythe union.21 A picket supervisor is under a duty to show the relevant employer or their agent the letter onrequest “as soon as reasonably practicable”.22 When attending the picket the supervisor must wear“something” (such as a badge or armband) so that they are readily identifiable.23Should there be a failure to comply with any of these conditions then the protection of the immunitiesagainst tort action, for the union and for individual pickets, will be withdrawn. Thus, for example, if apicket supervisor is not available or if the letter of authorisation has been mislaid, or if the picket supervisorhas forgotten to wear the “official” armband, the picket will be deemed to be automatically unlawful, thelegal consequences of which is an injunction being granted to stop the picketing and a subsequent damagesclaim. Some of the conditions may be particularly difficult for unions to follow—the larger the workplaceand the greater the number of entrances and exits the more supervisors will be required. It is highly unlikelythat any union could meet such demands solely through their full-time officials. In such circumstances aunion may need to recruit ordinary members who, if they are not familiar with the law and the Code ofPractice and are not able to be present or to be nearby at all times, may well inadvertently violate theprovisions of the statute. It is clear that the new conditions constrain the freedom of workers and tradeunions to organise and participate in peaceful picketing and the likely impact of these new rules will befurther injunctions being granted for relatively trivial reasons.In order to ascertain if these provisions are in violation of art.11(2) safeguards, the question to beaddressed is—are they a balanced, measured and proportionate means of securing the government’sobjectives? The underlying policy objectives (identified in the Consultation papers published prior to thepassage of the statute through Parliament) make it clear that the picket supervisors’ role is to encourageresponsible behaviour on the picket line and deter intimidatory and violent conduct in order to safeguardthe rights of workers, management and members of the public.24 Yet, there is little substantive evidenceof disorderly picketing25; there is already a whole range of criminal and civil law actions available to thestate or the employer to control unruly picketing; and, as noted earlier, picketing has to be peaceful for aunion to enjoy the benefit of the immunities. Academic research has also demonstrated there is little need18 Section 220A(2), (3).19The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Code of Practice on Picketing (March 2017) at paras 58–61.20TULR(C)A 1992 s.220A(4).21TULR(C)A 1992 s.220A(5), (7).22TULR(C)A 1992 s.220A(6).23TULR(C)A 1992 s.220A(8). Originally the Government proposed to legislate in order to limit general protests associated with strike action. Theconsultation document—Department for Business Innovation and Skills: Consultation on Tackling Intimidation of Non-Striking Workers (BIS 15/415,July 2015), pp.10–12—contained proposals to require trade unions to publish a plan of intended action in advance of any protest, to limit their use ofsocial media, to inform the Certification Officer of the picketing and protest activity and the creation of a new criminal offence of intimidation. Afterwidespread criticism this attempt at even tighter statutory control was abandoned.24Department of Business, Innovation and Skills: Consultation on Tackling Intimidation of Non-Striking Workers (BIS 15/415, July 2015), paras15–18.25The Consultation paper—Department for Business, Innovation and Skills: Consultation on Tackling Intimidation of Non-Striking Workers (BIS15/415, July 2015), pp.4–5—cited allegations made in The Carr Report: The Report of the Independent Review of the Law Governing IndustrialDisputes, 15 October 2014, commissioned by the primeminister to investigate allegations of intimidation during picketing activities at the Grangemouthindustrial dispute. The authors of the review themselves admitted there was little empirical evidence for these assertions, apart from anecdotalunsubstantiated commentary.“Right to strike” under art.11 of the EU Convention 161[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsfor this level of control. Over a 10-year period from 2005 to 2015, only five applications were made forinjunctions in relation to breaches of the picketing provisions of s.220 of the TULR(C)A 1992.26It is clear that the Government has not balanced the rights of both parties when introducing theserestrictions; the protection of the immunities will be withdrawn no matter how minor the breach andwithout regard to whether the employer has suffered economic injury or been prejudiced in any way. Theconsequences for trade unions and their members, however, is not just the inability to picket but also thatindividual pickets will also lose their protection from unfair dismissal.27 These harsh penalties for a failureof complying with an organisational regulation (such as forgetting to wear an armband or misplacing aletter of authorisation) offend against the notion of “proportionality” inherent in the requirements ofart.11(2) and Strasbourg case-law.One aspect of the proportionality test outlined in Strasbourg case-law is whether the domestic law isconsistent with the requirements of relevant international law and contemporary European practice.Legislation that is in violation of international and European standards cannot be said to be “proportionate”.28The International Labour Organisation (ILO) and European Social Charter (ESC) supervisory bodiesrecognise that the right to picket is an inherent part of the “right to strike” and any unreasonable interferenceis a violation of ILOConvention 87, art.3 and ESC art.6(4).29As the new restrictions impose disproportionateand discriminatory obligations on trade unions and extensive regulation of picketing it is unlikely thatthese provisions will be in compliance with ILO and ESC standards.As there is no clear “pressing social need” for these new restrictions; as they are disproportionate; andas there has been no attempt to balance the interests of the relevant parties it is doubtful the governmentcould establish a justification for these picketing initiatives. These provisions will simply hinder theorganisation of legitimate picketing by trade unions and furnish employers with further opportunities tolimit picketing in industrial disputes. In short, the picketing requirements in the Trade Union Act 2016,by imposing this level of state supervision of picketing without appropriate justification, are likely to bein violation of art.11.The balloting provisionsA trade union, when taking lawful industrial action, has to comply with existing detailed and complexprocedures relating to the conduct and organisation of an industrial action ballot and to the content of anysubsequent strike notice.30 Without full compliance with all the balloting procedures any strike is unlawfuland an injunction may be granted prohibiting the industrial action. The provisions of the Trade Union Act2016 builds on this existing structure of regulation. Section 2 of the Trade Union Act (inserting a news.226(2)(a)(iia) into the TULR(C)A 1992) introduces a new minimum turnout requirement when a tradeunion is balloting for industrial action. At least 50% of union members eligible to vote must participatein the ballot, and of those that participate, a majority of those voting support the call for action. TheGovernment’s view is that this would enhance the democratic process; that it will ensure that “… industrial26G. Gall, “Injunctions as a Legal Weapon in Collective Industrial Disputes in Britain 2005–2014” (2016) 54 B.J.I.R. 187.27 If there is a breach of s.220A, picketing will not be “protected industrial action” for the purposes of a claim for unfair dismissal under s.238A ofthe TULR(C)A 1992.28 For example, in coming to the conclusion that restrictions on collective bargaining were disproportionate the Grand Chamber in Demir v Turkey(2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 54 made specific reference to ILO Convention 98 (On the Right to Organise and to Bargain Collectively) and 151 (On the Rightto Organise in Public Service) and art.6 of the Council of Europe’s 1961 Social Charter. In Hrvatski Lijecnicki Sindikat v Crotia (App. No.36701/09),judgment of 27 February 2015 the court held that a prohibition on strike action by the Croatian medical union in support of collective bargaining wasa violation of art.11. In particular, Judge Pinto De Albuquerque confirmed that instruments of international law must be taken into account whenassessing proportionality.29 See the Digest of Decisions and Principles of the Freedom of Association Committee of the Governing Body of the ILO (2006) at [651]; On ESCart.6(4) see European Trade Union Confederation v Belgium (App. No.59/2009), 13 September 2011 at [29].30The laws regulating the conduct and organisation of industrial action ballots were originally developed in the Trade Union Act 1984, the EmploymentAct 1988 and the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993. These provisions and the limited reforms of 1999 and 2004 were consolidatedinto the TULR(C)A 1992.162 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsaction has democratic support and legitimacywithin the relevant workforce”31 and “… avoid great disruptionon very old ballots secured by low turnouts”.32In the United Kingdom, across all national and municipal elections, an accepted principle is that a simplemajority of those who voted is sufficient for a democratic mandate. The Government has, however,persistently refused, despite requests from trade unions, to countenance a switch from inefficient postalballots (that historically produce low turnouts) to secure workplace ballots or electronic balloting—bothsystems that would be far more likely to yield higher levels of member participation and so guarantee amore democratic decision than an arbitrary minimum turnout condition that will, in practice, be verydifficult to achieve.33This failure to introduce alternative and less restrictive votingmethods has implicationsfor the issue of proportionality, as other methods of fulfilling the aim of strengthening the democraticlegitimacy of a ballot could have been applied.34Research has demonstrated that this new provision will have a very serious impact on the ability oftrade unions to take action in support of collective bargaining—an essential element of trade union rightsunder art.11. In the period of investigation, between 1997 and 2015, if the 50% criteria was in place, only85 out of 158 strike ballots would have reached this threshold—a total of 3.3 million workers would havebeen denied the opportunity to take strike action.35 The Government’s own analysts have predicted a 65%reduction in industrial action stoppages. 36 This provision satisfies the stated objective of ensuring thatindustrial action has a very high level of democratic validity—nevertheless, in the context of its effect ontrade union ability to defend the legitimate interests of their membership, it is doubtful whether this canbe justified as a sufficiently balanced and proportionate constraint, particularly as alternative and lessdamaging voting methods could have been applied to meet the objective of strengthening the democraticlegitimacy of the ballot.In “important public services” (including the fire service, education (of those under 17) and healthservices, and the transport, border security and nuclear decommissioning sectors37) there is an additionalrequirement that industrial action will require the support of at least 40% of those entitled to vote.38 Asimple majority (that satisfies the new 50% participation threshold) will not be sufficient in order foraction to go ahead in these particular industries and any union member who abstains or forgets to returntheir ballot paper will effectively be deemed to be opposing the strike.The consequences of requiring a trade union to meet both the 50% threshold and the 40% minimumlevel of support for public sector disputes will have a serious impact on a trade union’s capability in thepublic services to call for action—one of the few sectors where unions remain strong. It will compromisea trade union’s ability to organise and prosecute lawful industrial action in order to protect centralisedcollective bargaining and weaken trade union opposition to the erosion of pay and conditions that areoften the corollary to cuts in public services. The Government’s justification for this measure ispredominantly an argument based on the inconvenience strikes in the public sector cause to the generalpublic.39 However, it is not clear there has been any attempt to balance the competing interests as requiredunder Strasbourg principles—a degree of disruption to the public is often unavoidable and temporary, yet31 The Trade Union Bill: European Convention on Human Rights Memorandum (BIS/15/415, July 2015), p.4.32Trade Union Bill Deb., 15 October, col.162, per Nick Boles.33The power to introduce new forms of voting for strike ballots have been available since 2004 through s.54 of the Employment Act 2004.34The Strasbourg Court in Glor v Switzerland (App No.13444/04), judgment of 30 April 2009 and in Nada v Switzerland (App. No.10593/08),judgment of 12 September 2012 noted that a relevant consideration in determining whether a restraint is proportionate is whether there are less restrictivemethods of fulfilling the aim of the measure under examination.35R.

In Demir v Turkey,40 a case on restrictions on collectivebargaining in the public sector, the Grand Chamber stated that such constraints on civil servants “mustnot impair the very essence of the right to organise” and must “ … not be arbitrarily imposed”.41 As notedearlier, the decisions of relevant international institutions outlining minimum labour standards are alsorelevant when determining the legitimacy of restrictions. The ILO Freedom of Association Committeehas explicitly held that the requirement that at least 50% of relevant employees in a dispute must turn outto vote in a ballot, is an “excessive” and “unjustified” requirement that hinders the right to strike.42 TheILO Committee of Experts has also condemned a requirement that over 50% of voters must approve astrike in a ballot as an “unreasonable” requirement and inconsistent with ILO Convention 87.43 TheGovernment has attempted to justify the new balloting regulations in the public sector by arguing that theimpact of strike action on public services justifies the additional controls.44 The ILO does permit states tointroduce a higher voting threshold in very limited circumstances—where the strike action is in “essentialservices”.45 The list of “important services” in the Trade Union Act 2016 includes services (such aseducation and transport) that do not fall within the ILO definition of “essential services” and thereforeshould not be restricted in this way.46Article 6(4) of the European Social Charter47 establishes the right of workers to take collective actionsubject to the qualification contained in art.31—a restriction has to be “necessary in a democratic society”for the “protection of the rights and freedoms of others”.48 By reference to this test, the supervisory bodiesof the European Social Charter have repeatedly been of the view that the detailed balloting requirementsin UK law is not in conformity with art.6(4)—due to their technical and complex nature.49 It is thereforehighly likely that the additional balloting provisions in the Trade Union Act will also be denounced as aviolation of art.6(4).In addition to the threshold criteria the Trade Union Act introduces further regulation of ballotingprocedure. For example, s.5(2C) and (2D) also stipulates that where unions ask for support for action shortof a strike, details of the actual type of action will need to be included on the ballot paper and that theballot paper must specify the anticipated length of the industrial action. The designated purpose of this isto enable a trade union member to make an informed decision when deciding how to vote. Employers are,however, also entitled to receive a copy of the ballot paper in advance simply for the purpose of determiningwhether the union has complied with these (and existing) requirements and then, where there is an error,to seek an injunction to stay industrial action. The failure of the union to meet these detailed requirementswill not cause the employer any practical disadvantage or inconvenience, and as they are obligationsdesigned to protect the interests of members, not employers, it must be questioned whether, as anunnecessary requirement, they are compliant with the principles underpinning art.11(2).40Demir (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 54.41Demir (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. at [119]. The Court has ruled on a number of occasions that disciplinary measures taken against civil servants forparticipating in strike action contravenes art.11—see TumHaber v Turkey (2008) E.H.R.R.19,Kaya v Turkey (App No.30946) judgment of 15 September2009 and Dogan Altun v Turkey (App No.7152/08), judgment of 26 May 2015.42Case 2698 (Australia) (2010).43Case 2896 (El Salvador) (2015).44Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Consultation on Ballot Thresholds in Important Public Services (BIS/16/15, July 2015), para.4.45These are defined by the ILO as services “… the interruption of which would endanger the liberty, personal safety or health of the whole or partof the people”. ILO General Survey on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining (1994), para.159.46The ILO has reserved particular criticism for the inclusion of education and transport as “important services” where this 40% threshold must bemet. Committee of Experts (on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations) Annual Report (2016), p.153.47The Charter is part of the same human rights structure as the Convention; deriving from the same parent body—the Council of Europe.48 Identical to the test outlined in art.11(2).49 See the Committee of Experts Reports Conclusions XV-1 (2000), p.637; XVI-1 (2002), p.688; XV11-1 (2004), p.516; XV111-1 (2006), p.509.The most recent report of the Social Rights Committee reiterated these criticisms Conclusions XX-3 (2014), p.22.164 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsSections 231 and 231A of the TULR(C)A 1992 already obliges trade unions to provide, to all thosemembers entitled to vote and relevant employers, detailed information about the number of votes cast;the number who voted yes; the number voted no; and the number of spoiled ballots. Section 6 of the 2016Act (amending s.231 TULR(C)A 1992) now additionally requires trade unions to additionally specifyhow many members were entitled to vote and whether the new minimum thresholds have been met. Alegislative requirement to inform the electorate of the result in broad terms may well be justifiable butcompelling the union to inform their membership of the result of the ballot in such detail (with any failureresulting in injunctive relief) arguably goes beyond what is required to satisfy the democratic objectiveof the provision.The Government’s consistent argument in the consultation documentation and whilst the Bill wasproceeding through its parliamentary stages was that these constraints on industrial action are necessaryin order to protect businesses, the economy and to avoid undue public inconvenience. Yet, the wholepurpose of industrial action is to put economic pressure on employers in order to encourage settlement ofthe dispute and, at times, a degree of disruption to the public is an unavoidable and natural consequenceof the enforcement of this right under art.11. Disruption to a business is not, on its own, a sufficient reasonto unduly limit strike action as a trade union’s right to strike and so cause economic damage—in order toprotect their members’ interests by forcing the employer to comply with a collective agreement—tookprecedence over the employer’s competing right to refuse to join the employers’ association and engagein collective bargaining.50 Furthermore, the argument based on the damage strike action causes to theeconomy and to the general public, is itself weakened by the statistical data. Days lost for strike actionhas fluctuated over the past 25 years but has most recently has shown a decline—for example, from 1.04million in 2007 to 170,000 in 2015.51ConclusionsUnder Convention principles it is self-evident that a government must act in good faith when devisingand implementing any restrictions on a Convention right. If the motive for restrictions impacting on aConvention right is ill-intentioned then the state will clearly be in violation of the relevant article. TheGrand Chamber in Demir52 reiterated this point when noting that the reasons introduced by the nationalauthorities to justify the restrictions must be “…relevant and sufficient”.53 The succession of additionalhurdles (to taking lawful industrial action) introduced by the Trade Union Act 2016 suggests that theprovisions may be more motivated by an ideological hostility to the trade union movement than a genuineattempt to improve industrial relations or economic efficiency; a motivation that the Strasbourg Courtshould take into account when assessing the validity of the aims of the legislation.It is also relevant to note that in Demir54 the Grand Chamber of the European Court not only referredto international labour standards (and associated jurisprudence) when determining the extent of art.11rights and the disproportionality of the Turkish law but also the legal consensus amongst ContractingStates to the Convention. The provisions of the Trade Union Act 2016 have developed controls on picketingand balloting far beyond regulatory requirements in Europe. Some regulation over picketing and ballotingis not unusual prior to industrial action, but no member of the Council of Europe regulates these industrialactivities to such an extent as the UK.50Gustaffson v Sweden (1996) 22 E.H.R.R. 409.51 See http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/workplacedisputesandworkingconditions/articles/labourdisputes/2015[Accessed 19 August 2017].52Demir (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 54.53 In applying this principle the Strasbourg Court rejected the Turkish government’s broad and unsubstantiated view that the ban on collectivebargaining was justified in order to limit industrial disorder.54Demir (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 54.“Right to strike” under art.11 of the EU Convention 165[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsFor a challenge to these provisions in the Trade Union Act 2016 to succeed at Strasbourg may dependon the European Court’s current attitude to the “margin of appreciation” doctrine. In RMT v UnitedKingdom55 the Strasbourg Court was willing to give the UK a wide “margin of appreciation” (the discretionstates have in determining national law in areas of political or social sensitivity) when determining that atotal ban on secondary action was not in violation of art.11. The Strasbourg Court classified secondaryindustrial action as an “accessory” activity rather than a “core” aspect of trade union freedom of associationand held that if a restriction affects only an accessory aspect of trade union freedom, a wider margin ofappreciation is permitted to signatory states when assessing whether the interference can be justified underart.11(2).56 On this hierarchal classification of strike action it is arguable that a “core” trade union activitysuch as primary strike action and associated picketing should attract a much narrowermargin of appreciationthan “accessory” secondary action.It is undeniable, however, that the decision in RMT v United Kingdom57 reflected a cautious attitude tothe interpretation of art.11; mirroring a recent trend across the Convention of affording states a widemargin of appreciation in “sensitive” policy areas. 58 An alternative view is that the Court’s ruling in RMTv United Kingdom59 is an aberration; interrupting a more progressive line of case-law that have appliedConvention doctrines to labour law violations in a more consistent and purposive manner. There havebeen a number of decisions at Strasbourg (not involving the United Kingdom) that have endorsed theunderstanding in Demir60 and Enerji Yapi-Yol Sen v Turkey61 that strike action should be protected as ansignificant aspect of art.11 and that any restrictions should therefore be construed strictly.62 Furthermore,the Strasbourg Court in Unite v United Kingdom63 referred to the Grand Chamber’s judgment in Demir,64when confirming that the application of the “margin of appreciation” may be restricted in appropriatecircumstances. Although the Court arguably failed to apply established Convention principles to theindividual facts of the case (for possible “political” reasons, considered below) the Court did endorse theview that the breadth of the margin of appreciation depends on the nature and extent of the right and theapplicable restrictions, the strength of the competing interests and the state’s compliance with internationalinstruments and the European consensus. By reference to these guidelines a contemporary challenge tothe industrial action provisions of the Trade Union Act 2016 should be more likely to be successful—takinginto account that the Strasbourg Court has unequivocally accepted art.11 protects the “right to strike”,that the relevant “margin of appreciation” should be of a limited nature and that the Trade Union Act hassignificantly increased the level of interference—making it more difficult for the state to justify theprovisions.One major potential obstacle to an action at Strasbourg is the claim that the European Court has failedin recent years to examine cases involving the UK in a vigorous and consistent manner; aided by theabsence of a system of judicial precedent. Ewing and Hendy65 have argued robustly that that the severalunsuccessful Strasbourg cases, noted earlier in this article, have created a de facto UK “opt out” ofConvention protection for labour law violations; the Court has “… closed its doors to the British workerand their unions”.66 Although, in the UK context, persistent judicial, political and media criticism of55RMT (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 10.56RMT (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 10 at [87].57RMT (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 10.58 For further discussion of this theme, see M.

An optimist may point to the existing Strasbourg case-law,noted earlier (in decisions concerning other signatory states), that restate and apply relevant and expansiveConvention principles on the nature and scope of art.11 rights in a more forceful and apt manner.Furthermore, it may be the case that the European Court will revert to a more critical and consideredanalysis of UK labour law once it becomes clear that their emollient decision-making has had little or noimpact on political or media criticism in the UK of the Strasbourg process. If the criticism of Europeaninstitutions generally becomes more strident as a consequence of conflict over the “Brexit” negotiations,the Court may come to this conclusion sooner, rather than later.69As a result of recent experience at Strasbourg, trade unions may well have become more reluctant tolitigate at Strasbourg. Although a “test case strategy” is a dangerous course of action (as each failure canbe used by government as a vindication of its legal policy) it may only be a matter of time before theEuropean Court of Human Rights returns to the principles stemming from cases such as Demir.70 Whenthat happens the considered judgment of the Strasbourg Court is likely to be that the balloting and picketingprovisions in the Trade Union Act 2016 are incompatible with the Convention and in violation of art.11safeguards.67RMT (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 10.68RMT (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 10.69An issue for future consideration is the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to UK strike law. The right toassociate in trade unions is included in art.12 of the Charter and essentially repeats the wording of art.11 of the Convention. Although the EU Charteris only justiciable where matters of EU law are in dispute the Charter does have domestic legal authority. This was confirmed by the Supreme Courtin Benkharbouche v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2017] UKSC 62 where it was held that in certain circumstances UKlaw can be overridden where it is in conflict with the principles of the Charter. However, a potentially promising line of enquiry on the possible impactand scope of the Charter will be severely circumscribed if the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill currently proceeding through Parliament passeswithout amendment as it provides that the Charter will no longer have legal effect in the UK post-Brexit.70Demir (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 54.“Right to strike” under art.11 of the EU Convention 167[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCase AnalysisJoannou v Turkey: An Important LegalDevelopment and a Missed OpportunityNasia Hadjigeorgiou*University of Central LancashireCyprus; Delay; Enforcement; Protection of property; Right to effective remedy; Right to fair trialAbstractThis article analyses Joannou v Turkey, the latest judgment of the European Court of Human Rightsaddressing the issue of forced displacement in Cyprus.

On the other, it argues thatboth the Court and the Republic of Cyprus missed an opportunity to use the case as a springboard forimproving the procedures followed and the remedies provided by the Commission.IntroductionOn 12 December 2017, the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (“the Court”) deliveredJoannou v Turkey,1 its latest judgment in the saga of Greek Cypriot forced displacement cases.2 Previouscase-law of the Court had found Turkey responsible for violations of property rights of Greek Cypriotsin the areas not under the control of the Republic of Cyprus3 and determined that the Immovable PropertyCommission (“IPC” or “Commission”) could provide an effective domestic remedy to these violations.4Joannou v Turkey develops this jurisprudence by being the first case since the Court’s endorsement ofthe Commission in 2010, to find that the IPC did not provide an effective remedy. This ruling is significantfor two reasons: first, it gives rise to welcome guidance by the the Court on the practices and proceduresthat should be followed by a domestic remedying body, like the IPC. Secondly, it reasserts the Court’sreadiness to exercise a supervisory function over the implementation of this guidance and guarantee theeffectiveness of the Commission. At the same time, however, Joannou presents a missed opportunity bothon behalf of the Court and the Republic of Cyprus. On the one hand, the Court’s unwillingness to examinein more detail the processes followed by the IPC has arguably encouraged the continuation of obscurepractices and undermined a sense of procedural justice among the applicants. On the other, the Republicof Cyprus’ refusal to intervene as a third party in this case resulted in a lost opportunity to present evidencerelating to a potential substantive violation of the right to property.*Dr Nasia Hadjigeorgiou is a Lecturer in Human Rights and Transitional Justice in the School of Law of the University of Central Lancashire.

SE14 (“Demopoulos”).[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors168The facts of the case and decision of the CourtThe applicant’s central argument in Joannou concerned delays in the proceedings of the IPC, whichallegedly constituted violations of art.6 (right to fair trial), art.13 (right to an effective remedy), art.14(freedom from discrimination) and art.1 of Protocol No.1 (right to property, henceforth “A1P1”) of theEuropean Convention on Human Rights. In particular, Ms Joannou had submitted her application to theIPC inMay 2008 and proceedings were still pending when the Court delivered its judgment nine-and-a-halfyears later. This delay, it was argued, was caused by the unreasonable demands of the Office of theAttorney-General, which was representing the authorities of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”(“TRNC”), and the unwillingness or inability of the Commission to put a stop to these.A timeline of events illustrates this argument5: when the applicant filed her claim with the Commission,she had included documents showing that she was the owner of 18 dönüm of land in the areas not underthe control of the Republic, over which Turkish authorities and the IPC have jurisdiction. The documentsshowed that the land in question had originally belonged to her mother and aunt, who then transferred itto the applicant. When the Attorney-General responded to the applicant’s claim in May 2010, he arguedthat Ms Joannou had not demonstrated that she was the legal heir of the original owners and that sheshould submit additional documents that proved this. The problem arose from the fact that the aunt’s namewas spelled in slightly different ways in various documents that had been submitted to the IPC, which theAttorney-General contended, prevented him from being certain about the identities of the parties. Thus,clarificatory documents of this nature were requested and submitted four more times during the periodbetween November 2012 and April 2013. In late 2013, the Attorney-General indicated that he could makethe applicant an offer for a friendly settlement, if she provided additional documents showing the datesof birth and death of the two original owners. Further delays ensured, with no substantive developmentstaking place, until the Court delivered its judgment in December 2017.Turkey responded by arguing that any delays were the result of the applicant’s bad communication withher lawyers and not the fault of the Commission. Rejecting this, the Court held that the applicant hadadequately proven her identity and legal claim to the properties, and any delay should be attributed to the“TRNC” authorities. Specifically, much time could have been saved, had the IPC identified the controversialpoints from the outset of the case and gathered evidence in relation to them in a more efficient manner.6Its failure to do so, meant that it “did not act with coherence, diligence and appropriate expedition”, whichresulted in a unanimous finding of a procedural violation of A1P1.7 Moreover, the majority of the Courtreasoned that since the applicant’s central grievance concerned her inability to be remedied for a violationof her right to property, her complaint should be examined solely under this article.8 Dissenting on thispoint, Judge Karakaş held that in addition to a violation of the right to property, an examination of thecomplaint under art.6 would have been more appropriate. This makes it the first time that a Turkish judgeat the Court agrees with the majority that there has been a human rights violation in a Greek Cypriotdisplacement case.Joannou as an important legal developmentOn the face of it, Joannou looks like a dry, procedural decision on delays in the proceedings of an obscurebody, with limited wider implications. However, the importance of the case becomes clear when it issituated in, and understood as part of, the Court’s more general jurisprudence on remedying displacedpersons both in Cyprus and other frozen conflicts. The first such forced displacement case to have reachedthe Court was Loizidou v Turkey, in which the applicant successfully made the ground-breaking argument5This is detailed in Joannou (App. No.53240/14) at [7]–[38].6 Joannou (App. No.53240/14) at [104].7 Joannou (App. No.53240/14) at [116].8 Joannou (App. No.53240/14) at [57].Case Analysis 169[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthat the presence of Turkish troops in the north of Cyprus since 1974, and the military, economic andpolitical control that Turkey exercises in the area, rendered it—and not the Republic of Cyprus—responsiblefor any violations that took place there.9 Building on this reasoning, the Court held that preventing theapplicant from accessing her property in the areas not under the control of the Republic, or using it in anyway, constituted a violation of A1P1.10 Since the “TRNC” Constitution considered the relevant GreekCypriot properties as voluntarily “abandoned”, rather than forcibly evacuated during the war, it did notallow for the provision of an effective remedy to applicants like Ms Loizidou. Exceptionally therefore,Loizidou gave Greek Cypriot displaced people direct access to the Court, without a need to exhaustdomestic remedies.In the early forced displacement cases against it, Turkey refused to accept any responsibility, contendingthat even if a violation had taken place, which it disputed, this was due to actions of the authorities of the“TRNC”, an independent and sovereign state.11 Following the Court’s consistent rejection of this argument,12Turkey changed tactics in Xenides-Arestis, when it submitted that the case should be found inadmissiblebecause the applicant had failed to exhaust the newly established domestic remedy of the IPC.13 The Courtaccepted in principle that the Commission could offer an effective remedy, but rejected the argument onthe facts of the case because the IPC’s procedures, and the substantive remedies it provided, suffered fromseveral deficiencies. In delivering this decision, the Court offered the first preliminary guidance on theprocedures and safeguards that should be adopted, and remedies that should be made available, by bodiessuch as the Commission. It indicated that members of the IPC should not have a conflicting interest (e.g.by themselves occupying properties owned by Greek Cypriot displaced persons); that the Commissionshould also consist of international members, and not just Turkish Cypriots; and that it should allowapplicants to ask for restitution, in addition to the remedy of compensation.Turkey swiftly complied with this guidance by amending the IPC Law, so when the nextcase—Demopoulos v Turkey—was heard, it was held that the Commission provided an effective remedythat applicants should exhaust before resorting to the Court.14Demopoulos was a game changer for GreekCypriots who lost their direct access to the Court, but it also provided additional guidance for the IPC’smore effective operation. It indicated that it would not constitute a problem if the majority of applicantswere remedied through compensation15; that the Commission should be accessible to the applicants interms of its language of operations (which was satisfied if proceedings took place in Turkish and weretranslated in English)16; and that it should remain independent and impartial.17Since Demopoulos, a range of cases concerning the IPC have reached the Court. In all of them, theCourt endorsed the remedy that had been ordered by the IPC and confirmed the effectiveness of theremedying body.18 It also indicated that remedies that had not been discussed in detail in Demopoulos,like the remedy of exchange, were compatible with the Court’s jurisprudence.19 In one case, Meleagrouv Turkey, the Court accepted the argument that quasi-judicial bodies like the IPC were subject to therequirements of art.6, but did not find that the four-and-a-half-year period of proceedings constituted anunreasonable delay and a violation of the right to a fair trial.20 Finally, in Loizou v Turkey the Court held9 Loizidou v Turkey (Preliminary Objections) (1995) 20 E.H.R.R. 99 at [62].10 Loizidou (Merits) (1997) 23 E.H.R.R. 513 at [63].11 Loizidou (Preliminary Objections) (1995) 20 E.H.R.R. 99 at [47].12 Loizidou (Preliminary Objections) (1995) 20 E.H.R.R. 99 at [62]; Loizidou (Merits) (1997) 23 E.H.R.R. 513 at [56]; Cyprus v Turkey (2002) 35E.H.R.R. 30 at [77].13Xenides-Arestis v Turkey (2011) 52 E.H.R.R. 16.14Demopoulos (2010) 50 E.H.R.R.

In particular,it sets an upper time limit, which did not exist so far, over which the remedies provided by the Commissionwill be considered ineffective. Although the Court had previously addressed the prolonged proceedingsargument in Meleagrou and Loizou, the specific facts of these cases, which did not resemble those of atypical IPC case, had not given rise to adequate recommendations on this issue. The Court has indicatedin previous case-law whether delays will result in a violation:“[M]ust be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the case and with reference to the followingcriteria: the complexity of the case, the conduct of the applicant and of the relevant authorities andwhat was at stake for the applicant in the dispute.”22Since most IPC cases are similar in terms of the listed criteria, the ruling in Joannou can give rise to afairly accurate indication of when delays render the Commission ineffective.Moreover, the case is significant because it reasserts the Court’s willingness to continue scrutinisingthe practices of the IPC, even after it has determined that these generally result in effective remedies. TheCourt made it clear that its finding in this case does not impact on the general effectiveness of theCommission since:“[I]t is perfectly possible that a remedy that is in general found to be effective operates inappropriatelyin the circumstances of a particular case.”23Thus, Greek Cypriots are still under an obligation to resort to the IPC in order to be remedied forviolations of their right to property. At the same time, however, Joannou paves the way for the launchingof other cases against the IPC before the Court. Following Demopoulos, concerns were raised (mostly byGreek Cypriot academics and commentators24) that by endorsing the IPC, the Court had washed its handsoff the Greek Cypriot displacement issue. This case suggests that the Court’s approach is, in fact, morenuanced than that. While it gave Turkey the benefit of the doubt when it recognised the effectiveness ofthe IPC in Demopoulos, it moderated this in Joannou by remaining vigilant that the applicants actuallyreceived what they had been promised. This was explicitly asserted when the Court noted that:“[I]t remains attentive to the developments in the functioning of the IPC remedy and its ability toeffectively address Greek Cypriot property claims.”25Finally, Joannou could potentially provide guidance for the establishment of remedying bodies similarto the IPC, in other frozen conflicts around Europe. While, originally, the only frozen conflict that hadgenerated European Court of Human Rights case-law was the one relating to Cyprus, recently the GrandChamber delivered two judgments—Chiragov v Armenia and Sargsyan v Azerbaijan—on the remedyingof forced displacement in Nagorno-Karabakh.26 In the merits judgments of both cases the Court madeextensive references to its Cyprus case-law and emphasised the respondent States’ obligation:21 Loizou v Turkey (App. No.50646/15), judgment of 3 October 2017.22Frydlender v France (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 52 at [43].23 Joannou (App. No.53240/14) at [86].24 See E. Katselli-Proukaki, “The Right of Displaced Persons to Property and to Return Home after Demopoulos” (2014) 14 Human Rights LawReview 701; L.

In light of the political analysis that Eastern Ukraine will, or hasalready, become a frozen conflict, the Court is likely to follow its established case-law on Cyprus, includingthe guidance it provided in Joannou, when responding to these A1P1 arguments.31Joannou as a missed opportunityDespite its importance in developing the law, this case also created opportunities to deliver additionalguidance on the way the IPC should be operating, which neither the Court, nor the Republic of Cyprus,utilised fully. Specifically, the Court missed an opening to push the IPC into adopting more transparentand accessible procedures, while the Republic of Cyprus should have intervened and provided evidencepointing to a further violation of the substantive right to property.The first instance of a missed opportunity by the Court concerns its reluctance to address the fact thatthe Commission has not been complying with the IPC Law32 and the secondary legislation (“the Rules”)33that relate to it. According to these, the IPC operates in a similar manner to a civil court: the applicantmakes a claim for the provision of a remedy, the Attorney-General responds with a defence, and after thetwo sides have presented their arguments and evidence, the IPC decides whether a remedy should begranted to the applicant and what this entails.34 If the remedy is compensation, the Commission mustdetermine the appropriate amount by considering a range of factors listed in the Law.35 Yet the facts ofJoannoumake it clear that this was not the procedure followed by the Commission. Instead of the partiesparticipating in proceedings that resembled a civil case, they engaged throughout the nine-and-a-half-yearperiod in direct negotiations with each other. Eventually, the Attorney-General indicated that he waswilling to make an offer to the applicant for a given amount, without any explanation of how this wascalculated. Notably, this process did not take place in tandem with the procedure described in the Law,but as an alternative to it.In principle, there is nothing wrong with opting for informal negotiations, rather than quasi-judicialproceedings. In fact, the former is likely to be less confrontational and its outcomemore readily acceptableby the applicant, when compared to a judicially imposed remedy. What is problematic, however, is thefact that this process is regularly used by the Commission, without it being outlined, or its safeguardsdiscussed, anywhere in the Law.36 The IPC’s overwhelming reliance on this procedure is confirmed by27Chiragov (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 9 at [199]; Sargsyan (2017) 64 E.H.R.R. 4 at [238].28Chiragov v Armenia (App. No.13216/05), judgment of 12 December 2017; Sargsyan v Azerbaijan (App. No.40167/06), judgment of 12 December2017.29Ukraine v Russia (App. No.20958/14) (pending); see also, Press Release issued by the Registrar of the Court, “European Court of Human RightsDeals with Cases concerning Crimea and Eastern Ukraine” ECHR 345 (2014), 16 November 2014.30Ukraine v Russia (IV) (App. No.42410/15) (pending); Press Release issued by the Registrar of the Court, “European Court of Human RightsCommunicates to Russia New Inter-State Case concerning Events in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine” ECHR 296 (2015), 1 October 2015.31 International Crisis Group, “Can Peacekeepers Break the Deadlock in Ukraine?” Europe Report No.246 (Brussels/Kyiv/NewYork/Vienna/Washington, 15 December 2017).32 (“TRNC”) Law No.67/2005 (“Law for the Compensation, Exchange and Restitution of Immovable Properties which are Within the Scope ofSub-paragraph (B) of Paragraph 1 of Article 159 of the Constitution”) (henceforth, (“IPC Law”).33 (“TRNC”) RulesMade under Sections 8(2)(A) and 22 of the Law for the Compensation, Exchange and Restitution of Immovable Properties whichare Within the Scope of Sub-paragraph (B) of Paragraph 1 of Article 159 of the Constitution.34 IPC Law, s.16; Rules, ss.7 and 9.35 IPC Law, s.8(4).36N.

The Courthas indicated in the past that the requirement in A1P1 that any interference with the right to property is“provided by law”, means not only that this has a basis in national law, but also that the law is accessible,precise and foreseeable.39 As a result, it has found violations of the right to property in cases where therewere inconsistencies between what was described in the law and what was happening on the ground.40Yet, despite the existence of established case-law on this point, and clear evidence that the “TRNC”authorities did not apply the domestic legislation precisely and foreseeably, the Court allowed this practiceto continue.Further, the Court should have taken steps to enhance the IPC’s effectiveness by commenting on thestandard of proof used during its proceedings. The Court referred in detail to the Attorney-General’snumerous requests for additional documents and held that it was the Commission’s responsibility toestablish more efficient procedures for gathering evidence. It failed to note, however, that arguably partof the reason the IPC had not stopped the Attorney-General from making these requests is because,according to s.6(2) of the IPC Law, “the burden of proof shall rest with the applicant who must satisfythe Commission beyond any reasonable doubt” of his/her identity and legal claim to the property.41 TheCourt’s uncritical stance towards this high standard of proof is regrettable because it is neither in accordancewith the civil proceedings described in the IPC Law, nor with guidance from its previous case law, namelythat the remedying mechanism established by the respondent States “should be easily accessible andprovide procedures operating with flexible evidential standards”.42The last missed opportunity in Joannou lies, not with the Court, but with the Republic of Cyprus. Thisconcerns the alleged substantive violation of the right to property and, in particular, whether thecompensation amount granted to the applicants through the IPC process constitutes an adequate remedyfor the harm they have suffered. Of the 990 applicants that have been remedied by the Commission todate, 873 of them have received compensation.43 This is in the mist of allegations by a wide range of GreekCypriot stakeholders, including the Republic of Cyprus itself, that the compensation amount they receiveis so low that it does not constitute an effective remedy in the first place.44 These allegations are bestillustrated by the vastly differing amounts quoted by the two parties in Joannou, with the applicant askingfor €2,285,000 and the Attorney-General offering £60,000, approximately €80,000.Some guidance on bridging this gap should have been welcome by all, not least the Republic of Cyprus.Yet regrettably, and uncharacteristically in light of its practices in previous Greek Cypriot forceddisplacement cases, the Republic refused to intervene in the case and missed the opportunity to persuadethe Court to rule on this issue.45 The Court has already provided some guidance on what is an appropriatecompensation amount in Demopoulos when it noted that, in some instances, the valuations relied on bythe applicants were exceptionally high because they included very high interest rates and were based on37Presidency of the Immovable Property Commission, “Monthly Bulletin” Issue 98, 10 January 2018 at http://www.tamk.gov.ct.tr/dokuman/istatistik_ocak18ing.pdf [Accessed 12 March 2018] (“Presidency of the IPC, ‘Bulletin’”).

Nevertheless, this guidance remained generalbecause the applicants inDemopoulos had not actually been compensated by the IPC, since they had failedto resort to it in the first place. Joannou was the first case in which each side had given its preferredcompensation amount, without the applicant having already accepted the Attorney-General’s offer, thusgiving an opportunity to the Court to choose between the two alternatives. In light of this, had the Republicof Cyprus intervened, it could have provided information, based on Land Registry records, on the valuationof specific properties and compared them with compensation amounts awarded by the IPC. In turn, thiscould have given the Court the perfect opportunity to provide meaningful guidance on the substance ofA1P1.ConclusionJoannou, the latest in the saga of Greek Cypriot displacement cases, constitutes both an important legaldevelopment and a missed opportunity. On the one hand, it develops the growing jurisprudence of theEuropean Court of Human Rights on frozen conflicts by offering guidance on the best way to ensure theeffectiveness of remedying bodies, like the Commission. Moreover, the case is of interest to Cypriotsmore specifically, since it sends the message that the Court is willing to continue playing an active rolein the protection of human rights in the area. On the other hand, Joannou presents a missed opportunityboth on behalf of the Court and the Republic of Cyprus itself. The Court could have provided greaterguidance for the effectiveness of the Commission by finding a violation due to the IPC’s failure to complywith its own establishing legislation. It could have also raised as a potential problem the excessively highstandard of proof used by the Commission, which makes it much harder for applicants to access theremedies the IPC was established to provide in the first place. Finally, the Republic of Cyprus should haveintervened and provided evidence to support its position that the compensation amounts awarded by theIPC do not constitute an effective remedy. These missed opportunities suggest that Joannou is not the lastof the Greek Cypriot displacement cases; important as it might be, the ground-breaking case that is topotentially determine the value of 36% of the island of Cyprus, is yet to come.174 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCase and CommentSelected decisions from theEuropeanCourt ofHumanRights fromNovemberand December 2017Editor: Dr Sofia Galani, Lecturer in Law, Human Rights Implementation Centre, University of BristolLaw School.Contributors: Richard Costidell, Pablo Fuenzalida, Christopher Gray, Kaj Hadad, Lucie Laffont,Anthony Morelli, Jordan Owen, Jennyfer Vervisch (University of Bristol).Note on Court judgments: European Court judgments can be delivered by a Grand Chamber of 17judges, a chamber of seven judges from one of the Court’s five sections or, where the issue is already thesubject of well-established case-law, by a committee of three judges from one of the sections.

The case concerned thenegligent mistreatment of the applicant’s husband at a variety of hospitals over the course of several years.The deceased was first admitted to the hospital of Vila Nova de Gaia (CHVNG) where he was to undergoa nasal polypectomy. After having been discharged, the deceased began to suffer from severe headaches.Having returned to hospital he was diagnosed with a psychological disorder and was prescribedtranquillisers. It was recommended that the deceased should leave the hospital, but the applicant objectedand the next day the deceased was re-examined by a new medical team who diagnosed him with bacterialmeningitis. Accordingly, the deceased was transferred to intensive care until 5 December 1997 upon whichtime he was transferred to the general medicine department and examined by Doctor JV. The deceasedwas discharged from hospital on 13 December 1997 it being thought that his health was stable. However,his pain persisted, and he returned to the hospital three times resulting in being re-admitted twice. On 3February 1998 Doctor JV authorised his release, however, after his pain continued to worsen he was175[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsre-admitted on the 17 February 1998 to the general hospital of Santo António in Oporto. It was there thathe died on 8 March 1998.Following her husband’s death, the applicant sent a letter to the Inspector General for Health in 2000who subsequently ordered an investigation. The investigation issued two reports, one in 2002 and, followingan appeal by the applicant against the findings of the 2002 report another was issued in 2005, both ofwhich concluded that the deceased had been treated properly. This led the Inspector General to close thecase. However, the applicant objected and new assessments, conducted in 2006, found that Doctor JV hadfailed to act in an appropriate and adequate manner when he decided to discharge the deceased on 13December 1997.In the meantime, in 1998, the applicant also contacted the Portuguese Medical Association. As a result,Doctor JV was subject to disciplinary procedures before the Medical Association however, in 2001, itconcluded he had acted appropriately.In 2002 the applicant also filed a complaint with the Oporto criminal investigation and prosecutiondepartment for the charge of manslaughter. Following the complaint, Doctor JV was charged withmanslaughter but was acquitted by the District Court, in 2009, on the ground that there was no evidenceto show he had been responsible for the death of the deceased. In 2003 the applicant then filed a newcomplaint with the District Court for damages following the losses she had sustained as a result of herhusband’s death. In 2012, these claims were dismissed on the grounds that her husband had undergonemedical treatment which was adapted to his clinical situation and subsequently no damages could besought. The applicant appealed that decision to the Administrative Supreme Court which dismissed herappeal on 26 February 2013. Finally, the applicant brought a claim to the European Court of Human Rights(the Court) alleging that her husband’s right to life had been violated by the Portuguese Government (theGovernment) as the hospitals at which her husband had been treated were negligent in their diagnosis ofa hospital-acquired infection. Her application also complained of prolonged delays in providing thedeceased with treatment, the length of domestic procedures and the fact she was not informed as to whyher husband’s death had deteriorated so quickly. Although the applicant also brought her claim under arts6 and 13 of the Convention the Court found that it was appropriate to examine the complaint solely underthe heading of art.2.Held(1) In reversing the judgment of the Chamber, the Court found that there had been no violationof the substantive element of art.2 (15 votes to two).The Court reiterated that the only circumstances under which a Contracting State may befound to have violated the substantive element of art.2 in cases of alleged medical negligenceis when the following cumulative conditions are met. First, the actions by the medicalprofessionals which are subject to the complaint must go beyond a mere error or a situationof medical negligence and must be of such severity so as to amount to circumstances whereit can be said that the patient was denied lifesaving treatment; second, the dysfunctioncomplained of must be of a structural nature so as to engage the positive obligation of thestate and cannot simply comprise of individual instances of procedures going badly; third,there must be a causal link between the systematic dysfunction complained of and the harmcaused to the patient; fourth the dysfunction complained of must have occurred as a resultof the state’s failure to ensure the effective functioning of a regulatory framework. In applyingthese criteria to the facts of the case, the Court held that there were no circumstances or anyexpert evidence which would conclusively indicate that the state had failed to meet itspositive obligation to provide and maintain a regulatory framework.(2) The Court found that there had been a violation of the procedural aspect of art.2 (unanimous).176 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe Court stated that in order for a Contracting State to be regarded as being in compliancewith its procedural obligation the procedures to which applicants have access must notmerely exist in theory but must also function effectively in practice. Further, the domesticsystemmust be entirely independent from those who are implicated by the events in question.The Court also held that to be in compliance with the procedural limb of art.2 the proceedingsmust be completed within a reasonable time frame. The Court emphasised that completionwithin a reasonable time frame is even more essential in cases concerning alleged medicalnegligence as it is only through resolution of domestic proceedings that hospitals within theContracting State will be able to examine their internal workings and address any proceduralproblems which arise as a result of the domestic proceedings. Building on this point, theCourt opined that lengthiness of proceedings in medical cases is a strong indicator that theContracting State has failed to meet the procedural requirements of art.2. In applying theabove to the present case, the Court found that there was no suggestion that the domesticprocedures were not independent or theoretically effective. Dealing first with proceedingsbefore the Inspector General for Health (IGH) the Court criticised the process for takingtwo years to simply open an investigation, a further year to appoint an inspector to head itand as a result the applicant’s first opportunity to present evidence was not until three yearsand six months after she had contacted the IGH. The Court therefore found that on thesefacts alone the investigation lacked promptness and failed tomeet the procedural requirementsof art.2.The Court then dealt with the proceedings which were brought before the PortugueseMedicalAssociation (MA). The Court found that the MA had responded promptly to the applicant’sletter and had convened a panel of experts to examine the case quickly. However, withregards to the overall length of the proceedings the Court found that although the four yearsand five months for which they were ongoing is not an unreasonable amount of time per se,the Court still found the length of time unreasonable owing to the fact that the proceedingsheard no evidence and consisted merely of examining written evidence. The proceedingsbefore the MA subsequently failed to satisfy the procedural limb of art.2.Finally turning to the criminal proceedings, the Court first stated that although the criminalproceedings began in 2002 when the actual investigation began it was solely based on thereport which was compiled by the IGH in 2006 and, as such, the proceedings were too narrowin scope to be regarded as effective. Second, the Court found that the proceedings whereneither prompt nor was their overall length reasonable given that they lasted in total for sixyears and eight months. The Court subsequently found that the criminal proceedings alsofailed to meet the procedural requirement of art.2.Cases consideredArskaya v Ukraine (App. No.45076/05), judgment of 5 December 2013Asiye Genç v Turkey (App. No.24109/07), judgment of 27 January 2015Bajić v Croatia (App. No.41108/10), judgment of 13 November 2012Calvelli v Italy (App. No.32967/96), judgment of 17 January 2002Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v Romania (App. No.47848/08), judgmentof 17 July 2014Dodov v Bulgaria (2008) 47 E.H.R.R 41Glass v United Kingdom (2004) 39 E.H.R.R 15Oyal v Turkey (2010) 51 E.H.R.R. 30Ramsahai v Netherlands (2008) 46 E.H.R.R 43Case and Comment 177[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsPowell v United Kingdom (2000) 30 E.H.R.R 152Vo v France (2005) 40 E.H.R.R 12CommentaryThe present decision did little in terms of crafting new legal principles but is instead a good example ofthe Court reaffirming and clarifying previously established jurisprudence. The finding of the Court thatthe substantive element of art.2 is not engaged in cases concerning themedical negligence of one practitioneris in keeping with previous jurisprudence. Also, the clarity with which the Court set out the criteria whichmust breached in order to engage the substantive limb of art.2 is undoubtedly welcome to legal practitionersand provides a clear position from which future cases before the Court can be judged.However, in contrast to the above, the partly concurring, partly dissenting opinion of Judge Pinto deAlbuquerque criticises the criteria for violating the substantive limb set out by the majority for being toonarrow in its scope. Judge Pinto de Albuquerque contended that the authorities cited by the Court and itsprevious jurisprudence did not support the interpretation which was offered by the majority and suggestedthat the majority ought to have found a violation of the substantive limb as, in his view, the failing wasof a systematic nature.This is a view which was also shared by Judge Serghides who argued that the view of the majority,namely that in order to trigger the substantive limb of art.2 the dysfunction must be systematic or structural,is incorrect. Judge Serghides reached this position by reasoning that in no other situation in which thesubstantive limb of art.2 is triggered does the jurisprudence of the Court require the problem at fault tobe systematic or structural. Accordingly, Judge Serghides argued that the Court had missed an opportunityto abandon the Powell principle and realign the jurisprudence relating to medical cases with thejurisprudence relating to art.2 in its entirety.Adoption and right to respect for family lifeAdoption—best child’s interest—duty to facilitate family reunification—margin of appreciation of nationalauthorities on children’s best interests—parental rights—right to respect for family life—art.8Adoption; Children’s welfare; Foster care; Margin of appreciation; Norway; Proportionality; Right torespect for private and family lifeStrand Lobben v Norway (Application No.37283/13)European Court of Human Rights (Fifth section): Judgment of 30 November 2017FactsThe present case concerns the right to respect for family life in the context of forced removal of parentingrights and subsequent authorisation to adopt a child in care by foster parents. The applicants were themother of the child, Ms Strand Lobben, her son, X—subjected to the previous measures—her daughter,Y—sibling of the latter—and the maternal grandparents, each one individually considered. They claimedthat the removal of the mother’s parental authority over X and the subsequent authorisation of X beingadopted violated their rights as guaranteed in art.8 of the Convention.The conflict regarding Ms Strand Lobben’s parental rights dates to her pregnancy in 2008, when sherequested a late abortion. The hospital referred the case to child welfare authorities, which began intervening178 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsbefore she gave birth to her son. She agreed to stay for three months after her child was born at a familycentre. During her stay at this centre, she was joined by her mother. The staff became concerned aboutMs Strand Lobben’s parenting abilities as X lost considerable weight and showed signs of late development.The mother withdrew her consent to stay at the family centre because she had not been allowed to takeher son home after her stay as she had demanded before moving to the centre. Her withdrawal led tocompulsory care of X by putting him in a foster home and arranging visits from the mother, usuallyaccompanied by the grandmother and sometimes also by the grandfather. Ms Strand Lobben appealedagainst this decision claiming that she could live with her son at her parents’ house who were willing tohelp her. Considering the negative reports coming from the family centre staff and other experts, hersubsequent appeals were rejected in consideration of her psychological and physical neglect towards herson. After this decision, the authorities were granted a care order, which was appealed by the mother. Shesubmitted that the authorities had not tried less drastic interventions and that the decision was based oninsufficient evidence. The care order was overturned, but a readjustment period was ordered beforereunifying Xwith his family. During this period the mother was granted increased visiting rights, althoughthroughout these visits she and her parents were considerably hostile to the foster parents, all of whichdistressed X. The authorities successfully appealed the previous decision, confirming the compulsory careorder as the Norwegian Hight Court found that the care order was necessary for the child’s welfare andthat assistance measures for the mother were insufficient to allow her son to stay with her.Almost a year after the previous litigation came to an end, in 2011 the child welfare authorities requestedthat the mother should be deprived of her parental responsibility over X and to grant X’s foster parentspermission to adopt him. Alternatively, the authorities proposed removing the mother’s contact rights.Conversely, the mother applied for the termination of the care order or alternatively an extension of hercontact rights. That same year she had given birth to Y and got married. The child welfare authoritiesconsidered that the mother was still incapable of giving X adequate care, deciding that the adoption wouldbe in X’s best interests. The applicant appealed against this decision, contending that there had been awrongful evaluation of the evidence, stressing that her situation had changed considerably, having a goodsupport system in her husband and extended family and was willing to accept help from the child welfareauthorities. The decision was upheld. The judgment contrasted the situation of Y, where parenting abilitiescould improve with help from the authorities, with that of X, who was portrayed as a vulnerable child,easily stressed, and his mother was not able to demonstrate she understood his special care needs to theextent that it would create considerable risk of abnormal development to him. The mother had also ventedher story on the internet, posting serious accusations against the child welfare authorities and the fosterparents, which she admitted in court were untrue. The court granted the deprivation of parental responsibilityand permitted the foster parents to adopt X. Both the High Court and the Supreme Court did not grantleave to appeal to the mother, therefore exhausting domestic remedies.Held(1) The Court unanimously declared admissible the complaints of the first (the mother) andsecond (X) applicants and the other three (Y, the grandmother and grandparent) inadmissible(unanimous).The Court dismissed the government’s objection of a conflict of interests between the minor’sand the natural mother’s interests, disqualifying the latter to apply on the child’s behalf too,as X’s complaint concerns the decision to sever his ties with his biological mother and theproceeding in that regard. With respect to the remaining applicants, the Court stated that theright to respect for family life in the case of grandparents refers to the right of havingreasonable contacts to maintain a normal grandparent–grandchild relationship, access whichis normally at the discretion of the child’s parents. Nonetheless, the Court did not take aCase and Comment 179[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsstand on this matter as it sufficed to declare inadmissible the complaints because of thefailure of these applicants to exhaust domestic remedies.(2) There had been no violation of art.8 (four votes to three).The Court considered that there was no positive development in the first applicant’scompetence throughout the three years in which she had had rights to access her son. Withrespect to the decision-making process before the national authorities, the Court consideredit had been a fair process. With respect to the assessment of exceptional circumstancesjustifying the measures in question, the Court had in due regard the fact that the domesticauthorities had the benefit of direct contact with all the persons concerned and reasoned thattheir decisions to deprive the mother’s parental rights and to permit the child’s adoption hadbeen motivated by an overriding requirement pertaining to X’s best interests.To evaluate the fairness of the decision-making process, the Court retorted to elements ofprocedural justice: if there were enough number of instances where the applicants couldexercise their rights and impugn adverse decisions; if the applicants had legal representation;and the time dedicated to evaluating arguments and evidence before adopting a decision.The Court concluded affirmatively to the existence of fair procedures.Finally, with respect to the removal of parenting rights and authorising the adoption of X,the Court agreed with the conclusion of the national authorities that the social ties betweenX and his mother were very limited and that by permitting X adoption by his current fosterparents would strengthen his sense of belonging with those whom he regarded as his parents.The Court also considered the distress suffered by X during his mother’s visits. For theCourt, this last element would play a relevant role as, in accordance to its own jurisprudence,adoption becomes an exceptional measure against parental rights in situations where thereis still a latent conflict which could erupt into challenges to a child’s particular vulnerabilityand need for security. In the present case, the Court stated that conflict has been a recurringtheme, where the mother has played a relevant part, including her lack of regard on theharmful consequence for X in the long term caused by the public exposure and legalproceedings. Even though the Court addressed the improving situation of the applicant, alsoacknowledged by the national authorities, it concurred with the latter regarding to theapplicants’ fundamental limitations and absence of empathy and understanding towards herson.Cases consideredAnayo v Germany (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 5Aune v Norway (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 3Gnahoré v France (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 38Görgülü v Germany (App. No.74969/01), judgment of 26 February 2004Johansen v Norway (1997) 23 E.H.R.R. 33K v Finland (2001) 36 E.H.R.R. 18Mandet v France (App. No.30955/12), judgment of 14 January 2016R v United Kingdom (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 2Scozzari v Italy (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 12TP v United Kingdom (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 2YC v United Kingdom (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 33180 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCommentaryThe case of Stranden Lobben is illustrative of the challenging task of balancing children’s rights andparents’ rights. The Court initiated its assessment focusing on the proportionality of the contestedmeasures,which are the most extreme possibilities as they irreversibly sever parental rights. The Court calibratedthe intensity of scrutiny required to assess the alleged violations to the Convention, distinguishing betweeninitial measures, such as taking a child into care, from further limitations. In the case of initial measures,the Court should leave the major margin of appreciation for national authorities, whereas with respect tofurther limitations, it must assess them using stricter scrutiny as they may curtail family relations.Nonetheless, the Court established that care orders should always be temporary measures and states havea positive duty towards facilitating the reunification of the natural parents with the child. The latter mustbe balanced against the child’s best interests. Far-reaching measures, such as adoption, should only beput forward under exceptional circumstances and motivated by an overriding requirement pertaining tothe child’s best interests. The Court emphasised that a child’s interest in cases involving care measuresand restrictions to contact must come before all remaining considerations. Therefore, it is in a child’s bestinterests to keep ties with their natural families unless they have proven particularly unfit to ensure achild’s development in a sound environment. Thus, art.8 does not entitle a parent to get rid of measuresadopted towards achieving that end. Before applying the previous criteria, the Court self-restrained byannouncing it must take into account the national diversity on the regulation of these matters, such as therole associated to the family, the appropriateness of the state intervention on family affairs as well as theavailability of resources.However, the judgment was not without strong dissent, announced by the tight voting. For the dissenters,the complaint cannot focus solely on the child’s adoption measures without scrutinising the previousplacement decisions. The time lapse became detrimental to the reunification of the family unit, influencedthe assessment of the child’s best interest and placed the mother in a position of conflict with the authoritiesand the foster parents. The dissenting judges criticised the allocation of responsibility solely on the motherwith respect to the decreasing and degradation of social ties with her son during the process. Their contentionextends to the Norwegian legislation’s restrictive access rights as they would have been proven to bedetrimental to a child’s early living stages. Norway’s preference of adoption over long-term foster careand the assumption that adoption is considered in the best interests of the child, was also questioned inthe dissenting opinion. Similarly, the dissenters opted for a hard-look review on the domestic authorities’decisions, underscoring several evidentiary gaps. They questioned why having subsequent children withoutquestioning of the mother’s parental skills—the investigation regarding Y found no shortcomings—wasnot considered as favourable evidence. No reasons from the experts can be found with respect to severingties with X’s sibling and his grandparents. Finally, they also criticised the lack of repertoire used by thechildren welfare authorities to tackle the foreseeable conflicts between natural and foster parents, as theauthorities did not explore alternative arrangements to reduce the existing hostility between them.In sum, the Court attempted to strike a delicate balance between a robust stance on the child’s bestinterests without excessive intervention at the domestic level, proceeding in a context-sensible way, opento extra-legal factors such as national idiosyncrasies and elements of legal realism such as effectiveenforcement of decisions in accordance with the available resources. The dissenters, on the other hand,criticised the Court for delivering a procedural assessment without enough consideration of substantiveaspects which, paraphrasing its authors, risks reducing the Court’s role to that of a bystander of thedisintegration of familial relationships and the destruction of roots by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.Case and Comment 181[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsRecognition of same-sex marriagesSame-sex marriage—recognition—legal protection—right to private life—art.8—right to marry—art.12—right to freedom from discrimination—art.14Italy; Marriage; Right to respect for private and family life; Same sex partners; Treaty interpretationOrlandi v Italy (Applications Nos 26431/12; 26742/12; 44057/12 and 60088/12)European Court of Human Rights (First Section): Judgment of 14 December 2017FactsThe applicants are six same-sex couples comprised of one Canadian and 11 Italian nationals. All couples,accepted to be in stable and committed relationships, had previously been legally married in either Canada,the Netherlands or the United States. Upon return to Italy the applicants had sought to have their marriagesregistered, but the Italian courts held that marriages registered in foreign countries between same-sexpartners would not be recognised by Italian law. The Italian Ministry of Internal Affairs provides that theCivil Status Registry only recognise marriage between a man and a woman in order to preserve internalpublic order.The applicants complained that in failing to register their marriage or provide legal recognition of theirfamily union, the Italian government discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. The court was toestablish if Italy had violated art.8 (the right to respect for private and family life) and art.14 (freedomfrom discrimination) in conjunction with arts 12 (right to marry) and 8.Orlandi bears similarities toOliariv Italy (2015), in which the Court found that Italy has an obligation under art.8 to provide legal protectionfor same-sex couples. However,Orlandi is first concerned with the refusal to register the foreign same-sexmarriages of the applicants as a violation of the Convention. If not, the Court is to decide if the applicantswere without legal protection prior to Oliari and its legal effects in Italy.Held(1) The application was declared admissible by majority.(2) There was a violation of art.8 (by five votes to two).The Court reaffirmed that states are authorised to restrict access to marriage under art.12 aswell as under art.14 in conjunction with art.8, citing both the Schalk and Chapin cases.However, the Court reaffirmedOliari in that same-sex couples are in need of legal protectionof their relationship. The Court noted that following Oliari, the Italian law had indeedprovided for same-sex civil unions through Law No.76/2016, providing those who hadcontracted marriage abroad as a means to register their union under Italian law. Oliari wasdeemed sufficient to satisfy Convention standards that “civil unions provide an opportunityto obtain a legal status equal or similar to marriage in many respects” and “give more orless the same protection as marriage with respect to the core needs of a couple in a stableand committed relationship”. Therefore, the scope of the judgment was restricted to adetermination that the respondent state’s refusal to register the applicant’s foreign same-sexmarriage in any form was a violation of rights under the Convention, as well as if the182 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsapplicants were left in a legal vacuum without any protection (prior to Oliari) and if itamounted to a violation of rights under art.8.The Court noted that Italy’s refusal to register the applicant’s marriage under Italian law byreason of “public order” is not provided as a legitimate interest under art.8 in which a statemay interfere with the rights of the applicants. However, the court recognised the legitimacyof the respondent state’s aim to prevent public disorder, insofar as recognition of a foreignmarriage as a marriage was not provided for in domestic law and would represent acircumvention of the legislative prerogatives of the state. In balancing the interest of theapplicants against that of the community, the Court held that the state enjoyed a wide marginof appreciation given that the case raised sensitive moral and ethical issues. Further, therewas no consensus within the Council of Europe states on the issue of legal recognition ofsame-sex marriage. Therefore, given that recognition of same-sex marriage was within theauthority of the state, the refusal to register the applicant’s marriage did not deprive theapplicants of any rights recognised in Italy.Concerning the violation of rights under art.8 as a result of the applicants being left in alegal vacuum prior toOliari and Italian Law No.76/2016, the Court held that the respondentState had failed to legally recognise the respondent’s union, de facto or de jure, resulting inno legal protection and undue obstacles in daily life. The Court held that, as in Oliari, thestate insufficiently put forward a prevailing community interest and thus failed to strike afair balance between the interests of the applicants and those of the community. Therefore,there has been a violation of art.8 of the Convention.(3) There was no need to examine the complaint under art.14 in connection with arts 8 and 12(unanimous).(4) The respondent State was ordered (by five votes to two) to pay each applicant:€5,000 in non-pecuniary damage.(a)(b) €9,000 in respect of costs and expenses.(5) Dismissed the remainder of the applicants’ claims for just satisfaction (unanimous).Cases consideredChapin v France (App. No.40183/07), judgment of 9 June 2016Dadouch v Malta (2014) 59 E.H.R.R. 34Dickson v United Kingdom (2008) 46 E.H.R.R. 41Gas v France (2014) 59 E.H.R.R. 22Green v Malta (App. No.38797/07), judgment of 6 July 2010Hämäläinen v Finland [GC] (App. No.37359/09), judgment of 16 July 2014Jeunesse v Netherlands (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 17Oliari v Italy (2017) 65 E.H.R.R. 26Schalk and Kopf v Austria (2011) 53 E.H.R.R. 20Sheffield v United Kingdom (1999) 27 E.H.R.R. 163Wagner v Luxembourg (App. No.76240/01), judgment of 28 June 2007CommentaryLike Oliari, the Orlandi case concerns the contentious issue of legal equality for same-sex relationshipsand presented a possible avenue for the recognition of same-sex marriage by the Court under art.12 of theConvention. InOrlandi, the Court did not deviate fromOliari in an interpretation of the Convention whichrecognised that same-sex couples are entitled to legal status in some form that is equal or similar toCase and Comment 183[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsmarriage, but that the Court would not force states to recognise same-sex marriage on equal terms. Thisfollows from recognition that a narrow majority of Member States (24 out of 47) had legislated towardslegal recognition of same-sex relationships (thus the applicants were entitled to such protection), but thatthe full recognition of same-sex marriage lacked consensus in Europe. As such, the margin of appreciationremained in favour of the state.The concurring opinion of Judge Koskelo noted that while there was a violation of art.8, the reasoningadopted by the majority was incoherent at a moment when the Court could have offered “straightforward”conclusions. On the first issue of refusal to register foreign same-sexmarriages as marriages, Judge Koskelofinds that faced with recognition of a foreign status, the Italian legal order followed a normal exercise oflex fori in private international law. The Italian Court of Cassation legitimately deemed that a foreignsame-sex marriage “is incapable of producing the legal effects attaching to a marriage” because the Italianlegal order did not accommodate for it. Thus, Koskelo concludes that there was no violation of art.8 onthe grounds of refusal to register. However, Judge Koskelo holds that there was a violation of art.8 becauseprior to legislative amendments following Oliari, there was no specific legal framework for recognitionand protection of same-sex union. Therefore, the applicant’s foreign same-sex marriages could not havebeen recognised in any form. Judge Koskelo also asserted that the majority reasoning focusing on refusalof registration “unnecessarily confuses” the case because they conflated the absence of registration as acause instead of a consequence of a violation of art.8. This amounts to an unnecessary “detour” beforeconcluding simply that the failure of the respondent State is not in the refusal to register, but the failureto provide a framework for the recognition and protection of same-sex unions. In other words, there waslittle need to deviate from a clear application of Oliari.The dissenting opinions of Judges Pejchal andWojtyczek are based on the majority failure to adequatelyapply the methodology of treaty interpretation. The dissenting judges first invoked the Vienna Conventionon the Law of Treaties, stating that the Convention must be interpreted in accordance with internal law.The preamble to the Convention, taken in relation to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, stipulatesthat the Convention is meant to protect a limited number of rights. As such, the dissenting judges suggestthat the mandate of the Court, as defined in art.19, is to act as “the servant, not the master, of theConvention”. According to Pejchal and Wojtyczek, under arts 8 and 12, the state not only enjoys a widemargin of appreciation on the issue but should retain complete autonomy because it does not fall withinthe mandate of the Convention. Thus, the majority have imposed positive obligations that do not logicallyfollow from the Convention and is only possible by the High Contracting Parties within the principle of“no social transformation without representation”. The dissenting opinions also question the notion impliedby the majority that the court intends to revise the assumption that states are free to exercise the authorityto choose to recognise same-sex marriage.Altogether, the majority remain cautious in moving beyond the understanding that in order to protectthe rights of same-sex couples under the Convention, legal recognition and protection is sufficient andlegalisation of same-sex marriage remains the prerogative of the state. While the concurring opinion foundan issue with the coherence of the judgment on an issue requiring clarity, the dissenting views take issuewith the fundamental application of treaty interpretation and scope of the Court on an unsettled socialissue within the domestic sphere.184 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsFair trials and the principle of ne bis in idem in criminal proceedingsReasons for a verdict—terrorism—criminal proceedings—right to a fair trial—art.6—principle of ne bisin idem—art.4 Protocol No.7Criminal procedure; Double punishment; France; Reasons; Right to fair trial; Terrorist offences;VerdictsRamda v France (Application No.78477/11)European Court of Human Rights (Fifth Section): Judgment of 19 December 2017FactsThe applicant, Rachid Ramda, is a former member of the Islamic Salvation Front. He entered the UK in1993 under a fake identity. From July to October 1995, eight attacks were committed on the Frenchterritory. The applicant was suspected of having financed the attacks from London, and of being one ofthe leaders of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in the UK. He was arrested and put into detention pendingextradition to France under four International Arrest Warrants. The High Court opposed his extraditionuntil 2005, when he was given back to the French authorities and put into pre-trial custody.The applicant was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment and a permanent exclusion from the Frenchterritory for participating in a criminal association established with the aim to prepare one or more actsof terrorism. The correctional tribunal held that the material evidence confirmed the use of differentpseudonyms by the applicant and the transfer of money that had been used to prepare some of the attacks.The police also found several documents confirming his important role within the direction of the newspaperAl Ansar, used by the GIA to claim responsibility for the attacks. The financing and propaganda that hehad undertaken had made the realisation of the attacks possible. The Court of Appeal confirmed thejudgment and added that the GIA intended to overthrow the Algerian government through the establishmentin Europe of an external structure that would target the institutions and populations of countries supportingthe Algerian regime. The applicant had knowingly played a significant role in the realisation of the GIA’sgoal. This judgment became final when the Court of Cassation rejected the applicant’s appeal.In parallel proceedings, the Assize Court of Paris condemned the applicant of complicity in attemptedmurders and damage to property by an explosive substance that resulted in mutilations or disabilities. Thecourt relied on the three judgments held by the Indictment Division of the Court of Appeal of Paris, inwhich the judge underlined the intermediary role played by the applicant between the GIA and theperpetrators of the terrorist attacks. The applicant challenged the verdict on the grounds of art.4 of ProtocolNo.7 to the European Convention on Human Rights and the case of Serguei Zolotoukhine v Russia arguingthat, under the principle of ne bis in idem, he could not be convicted a second time for identical materialfacts. His claim was rejected by the Assize Court, which said that the applicant was sentenced under thecriminal procedure for a criminal behaviour. Sixty-three questions were asked during the proceedingsbefore the Assize Court. They specifically addressed the alleged facts, where and when they had beencommitted, the names of the victims and the harm they suffered and, more precisely, the premeditatedaspect of the crime and the role of the applicant in the commission of the attacks. The Court of Cassationdismissed the applicant’s claim that the judgment was in breach of art.6 of the Convention. It also rejectedthe claim that the Assize Court’s conviction was in violation of the principle of ne bis in idem.Case and Comment 185[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsMr Ramda addressed two complaints to the European Court of Human Rights pertaining to the violationof art.6(1) and art.4 of Protocol No.7 to the Convention.Held(1) The two complaints were admissible (unanimous).(2) The Court considered there had been no violation of art.6 (1) (unanimous).It reiterated its jurisprudence that juries are not required to provide reasons for their verdict.However, professional magistrates have a duty to give the reasons that led them to convictor acquit someone. One of the essential guarantees against arbitrariness is to make sure thatthe defendant has understood the verdict. Moreover, the duty of providing reasons for aconviction contributes to the right of a defence, as well as to the impartiality and transparencyof the judicial system. In the context of legal proceedings before professional magistrates,the domestic courts must clearly explain the grounds on which they relied to make theirdecision. Yet, the extent of this duty may vary and, therefore, must be assessed in the lightof the specific circumstances of the case. Each judgment held by the Indictment Chamberconcerned a different attack and was examined and justified on the basis of the alleged facts.Moreover, the proceedings before the Assize Court allowed the applicant to know what thecharges against him were, and the judges were asked detailed and specific questions. Theapplicant therefore knew of the reasons of his conviction and he could understand the verdictagainst him.(3) The Court held that there had been no violation of art.4 of Protocol No.7 to the Convention.It considered that, in the present case, the question was not whether the constitutive elementsof the offence in the correctional and criminal proceedings were identical, but whether thealleged facts in the two proceedings referred to the same criminal behaviour. The Courtexamined whether the facts for which the applicant had been convicted by the Court ofAppeal final judgment and those for which the proceedings had been maintained before theAssize Court were identical or substantially the same. Most of the evidence invoked beforethe Court of Appeal and mentioned in the three judgments of the Indictment Chamber weredistinct and addressed different behaviours. The Court added that it was legitimate for statesto act with firmness regarding those who contribute to terrorist acts and that the Court wouldnot condone such acts. Moreover, the applicant had been convicted by the Assize Court forfacts distinct from the ones that were the object of the first sentencing, and for the crimesof complicity of murder and attempted murder.Cases consideredA v Norway [GC] (2017) 65 E.H.R.R. 4A v United Kingdom [GC] (2009) 49 E.H.R.R. 1442Agnelet v France (App. No.61198/08), judgment of 10 January 2013Boldea v Romania (App. No.19997/02), judgment of 15 February 2007Daoudi v France (App. No.19576/08), judgment of 14 September 2011Hadjianastassiou v Greece (1993) 16 E.H.R.R. 219Grande Stevens v Italy (App. Nos 18640/10, 18647/10, 18663/10, 18668/10 and 18698/10), judgmentof 4 March 2014Ibrahim v United Kingdom [GC] (App. No.50541/08), judgment of 13 September 2016Ismoïlov v Russia (2009) 49 E.H.R.R. 42Kapetanios v Greece (App. Nos 3453/12, 42941/12 and 9028/13), judgment of 30 April 2015186 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsLhermitte v Belgium [GC] (App. No.34238/09), judgment of 29 November 2016Matis v France (App. No.43699/13), judgment of 6 October 2015Margus v Croatia [GC] (2016) 62 E.H.R.R. 17Oulahcene, Fraumens, Legillon and Voica v France (respectively App. Nos 44446/10, 30010/10,53406/10 and 60995/09), judgment of 10 January 2013Papon v France (2004) 39 E.H.R.R 10Ruiz Torija v Spain (1995) 19 E.H.R.R. 553Sergueï Zolotoukhine v Russia [GC] (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 16Simeonovi v Bulgaria [GC] (2018) 66 E.H.R.R. 2Suominen v Finland (App. No.37801/97), judgment of 1 July 2003Tatishvili v Russia (2007) 45 E.H.R.R. 52Van de Hurk v Netherlands (1994) 18 E.H.R.R. 481CommentaryThe Court relied on its earlier jurisprudence on jury trials and reiterated that the lack of reasons for verdictsby the jury is not in itself a breach of the right to a fair trial but has to be compensated by sufficientprocedural safeguards against arbitrariness. Professional judges have an additional duty to make sure thatthe defendant and the public understand the judgment. Their decisions have implications that go beyondthe defendant’s case and affect the democratic foundations of the society. In Agnelet, the Courtacknowledged the fact that the new legislation passed in France in 2011, which requires the Assize Courtto explain the reasons of its decisions, appeared to “significantly strengthen the safeguards againstarbitrariness”. In Ramda, the Court went further in praising the application of this legislation to cases triedbefore the Assize Courts comprised of professional magistrates. The Court clarified its stance regardingthe compatibility of the French legislation with art.6 and seemed to consider that the law now providesan adequate protection against arbitrariness in criminal proceedings.The present case arises within a very sensitive context, where France has been the recent target of deadlyterrorist attacks and is under the threat of upcoming ones. This is particularly significant in the Court’sfinding that there had been no violation of the principle of ne bis in idem. The Court relied on objectiveelements to conclude that there had been no violation. Nevertheless, it acknowledged the legitimacy ofstates’ firmness in handling terrorism cases. A finding of a violation would have nullified the criminalproceedings sentencing Ramda to life imprisonment, whilst there was overwhelming evidence of hiscentral role in the attacks. This would have certainly affected the legitimacy of the French judiciary ineffectively condemning acts of terrorism as well as serving justice.Housing distribution and the right to residenceHouse permits—planning—social and economic policies—income requirements—discrimination—rightto freedom to choose one’s residence—art.2 of Protocol 4Discrimination; Freedom of movement; Housing management; Local housing authorities' powers andduties; Netherlands; Residential tenanciesGarib v Netherlands (Application No.43494/09)European Court of Human Rights (Grand Chamber): Judgment of 6 November 2017Case and Comment 187[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsFactsA Dutch national, Ms R Garib, moved into the Tarwewijk district in the city of Rotterdam in May 2005.In 2007, she entered into an arrangement with her landlord whereby she and her two young children wouldmove to a larger property also in the Tarwewijk district, so that the landlord could renovate her originalproperty for his own use.In June 2006, the Inner City Problems (Special Measures) Act came into force over the Tarwewijkdistrict, meaning that households moving into the district required a housing permit to do so. The applicantrequested a housing permit for her family to move to the second property, but this was refused, as she didnot comply with the statutory requirements. These required that she have been a resident of Rotterdamfor six years or meet an income requirement which would exempt her from the residence requirement.The applicant objected to the decision by the city administration (the Burgomaster and Aldermen) butthey employed an advisory opinion by their Objections Advisory Committee which defended the housingpermits on the basis that there was the possibility to move to an area not considered a “hotspot”, and theneed to ensure a balanced and equitable distribution of housing. The applicant then appealed to the RegionalCourt and then the Council of State, arguing that her freedom to choose her residence, under art.2 ofProtocol No.4 of the European Convention on Human Rights and art.12 of the International Covenant ofCivil and Political Rights (ICCPR), had been violated. Additionally, she argued that the requirement ofsix years’ residence as applied to her constituted discrimination according to income, relying on art.26 ofthe ICCPR.The applicant’s appeals were dismissed in both courts. The interference with her right to freely chooseher residence was held to be justified by the need to ensure quality of life in districts of major cities, andthat the measure taken under the Inner City Problems Act was not disproportionate, as the restriction wastemporally limited and there was a sufficient supply of housing outside of the Tarwewijk district.Additionally, they noted an exemption “hardship clause” which applies only where the current residenceis an untenable living situation, but that this did not apply to the applicant. On the matter of discrimination,an indirect discrimination was found but the income requirement was also found to be necessary andproportionate for the legitimate aim of improving the quality of life. The applicant then appealed to theEuropean Court of Human Rights, alleging a violation of her freedom to choose her residence under art.2of Protocol No.4.Held(1) There had been no violation of art.2 of Protocol No.4 (by 12 votes to five).It was undisputed between the parties that there had been an interference with the applicant’sright to choose her residence under art.2(1) of Protocol No.4, so the Court looked to paras3 and 4 of the article, which provide for justifications for such an interference which isproportionate and in pursuit of a legitimate aim. The applicant argued that the fourthparagraph should be applied only in “exceptional situations” in line with its drafting historyand previous case-law. However, the Grand Chamber rejected this interpretation and sidedwith the Chamber finding that para.4 is to be applied, on the basis that the restriction waslimited in geographical scope, thereby opening it to broader justification “by the publicinterest”. The Court accepted that the restriction was properly enacted in law and that theintention of the legislation had been to “reverse the decline of impoverished inner-city areasand to improve quality of life generally”, which it considered a legitimate aim serving thepublic interest.With respect to the proportionality between the means employed and the legitimate aim, theCourt considered first whether the legislation and policy itself was proportionate, and secondly188 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorswhether the individual situation of the claimant outweighed the public interest. For theformer, the Court was satisfied that the close scrutiny of the legislative framework byParliament, and the resulting safeguard clauses, created adequate protection for the rightsand interests of persons affected. The government did thereby not exceed its margin ofappreciation in pursuit of the public interest under the article.The Court held that the applicant was not herself able to prove that her being unable to movewithin Tarwewijk had created a situation of hardship or risk for her or her family. Herpreference to do so could not provide a justification for her personal interest to override thelegitimate aim pursued by the government with the policy, and its consistent application.Cases consideredAnimal Defenders International v United Kingdom (2013) 57 E.H.R.R. 21Ayangil v Turkey (App. No.33294/03), judgment of 6 December 2011Chapman v United Kingdom (2001) 33 E.H.R.R. 399Golder v United Kingdom (1979) 1 E.H.R.R. 524Hatton v United Kingdom (2003) 37 E.H.R.R. 611Hutten-Czapska v Poland (2007) 45 E.H.R.R. 52James v United Kingdom (1986) 8 E.H.R.R. 123K v Finland (2003) 36 E.H.R.R. 255Landvreugd v Netherlands (2002) 36 E.H.R.R. 1039Lithgow v United Kingdom (1986) 8 E.H.R.R. 329Noack v Germany (App. No.46346/99), judgment of 25 May 2000Olivieira v Netherlands (2003) 37 E.H.R.R. 693Scoppola v Italy (No.2) (2010) 51 E.H.R.R. 12Ward v United Kingdom (App. No.31888/03), judgment of 9 November 2004CommentaryThe Grand Chamber in this case granted a wide margin of appreciation to states in policy addressing themanagement and development of large cities, which the judgment refers to as “necessarily involv[ing]consideration of complex social, economic and political issues”.While they acknowledge that a legislativeintervention in this area is not beyond the scrutiny of the Court, they show deference to the decision-makingprocess both at policy level and with respect to the applicant. The dissenting opinion of Judges Tsotsoriaand de Gaetano considers that the disproportionate burden on those reliant on social-security benefits asincome—a vulnerable group—warrants a closer scrutiny. Considering the applicant’s residence inTarwewijk prior to the introduction of the legislation, the dissenting judges view the refusal of a permitas tantamount to a forced eviction from the area, which, considering the applicant’s vulnerability as asingle mother to two children, is a disproportionate interference. This was taken further in the dissentingopinion of Judge Pinto de Albuquerque, who considered the aim of “deghettoising” Tarwewijk as, in fact,part of a larger effort of removing underprivileged inhabitants from the area, stemming from a conflationof poverty with threats to public order, and representing “real phobia of the poor”.It is notable that the Grand Chamber refused to consider whether the income requirement waiving theresidence requirement constituted a discrimination under art.14 on the basis of income status. This wasraised in the domestic courts but was not considered by the Chamber. Despite third-party support for anexamination of the legislation with respect to art.14, the Grand Chamber refused to consider this, arguingthat the scope of the case before them was limited to those grounds on which the Chamber had ruled onthe admissibility. The dissenting opinions each lament the missed potential of an examination under art.14Case and Comment 189[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorson these facts, Judge Pinto de Albuquerque, in particular, notes the potential for discussion of intersectionaldiscrimination, as yet unexamined by the Court despite increased recognition in international courts.University disciplinary measuresKurdish students—Turkey—university petitions—disproportionate disciplinary measures—victim status—costs awarded—right to education—art.2 of Protocol No.1—right to freedom of expression—art.10Disciplinary penalties; Freedom of expression; Language; Remedies; Right of individual application;Right to education; Turkey; UniversitiesÇölgeçen v Turkey (Application Nos 50124/07, 53082/07, 53865/07, 399/08, 776/08,1931/08, 2213/08 and 2953/08)European Court of Human Rights (Second Section): Judgment of 12 December 2017FactsThe case concerned an application by eight students of Kurdish origin who were studying at variousfaculties of Istanbul University. In 2001 the students petitioned the university requesting that Kurdishlanguage classes be introduced as an optional module. Upon receiving the petitions, the university begandisciplinary proceedings against the students, resulting in the applicants either being suspended for twosemesters or expelled from the university. Following the sanctions, the applicants claim they were brandedas terrorists, had their names put on notice boards around the university and some were even subjected tocriminal investigation. Upon notification of the disciplinary sanctions, the applicants lodged separateactions with the Istanbul Administrative Court requesting a stay of execution of the disciplinary decisions.In decisions given betweenMay and June 2002 the Istanbul Administrative Court suspended the executionof the applicants’ disciplinary sanctions on the ground that the sanctions in question were unlawful andtheir application would cause irreparable damage to the applicants. Following notification of the decision,the university re-enrolled all of the applicants between 25 June and 23 July 2002, enabling the applicantsto take missed exams. On 12 and 19 December 2002 the Istanbul Administrative Court examined themerits of the cases and annulled the disciplinary sanctions against the applicants on the ground that theywere unlawful. The university unsuccessfully challenged these decisions before the SupremeAdministrativeCourt. Subsequently the applicants launched actions for compensation with the Istanbul AdministrativeCourt pursuant to art.13 of the Administrative Procedure Act, claiming they had sustained psychologicaldamage as a result of the disciplinary punishment. Between September 2004 and January 2005 the IstanbulAdministrative Court awarded compensation to the applicants as they had been denied their right toeducation and their honour and dignity had been adversely affected by the accusations. However, betweenMarch 2007 and March 2008 the Istanbul District Administrative Court quashed these judgments anddismissed the actions, holding that, as the university had re-enrolled the students and enabled them tore-sit their exams, the conditions for awarding non-pecuniary damage had not been met. The applicantssubsequently applied to the European Court of Human Rights alleging violations of art.2 of Protocol No.1read in the light of art.10 due to the imposition of the disciplinary sanctions and a failure to provide foreducation of their mother tongue.190 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsHeld(1) The complaint concerning alleged denial by the authorities of the applicants’ right to educationon account of the disciplinary sanctions imposed on them was admissible (by a majority).Concerning the admissibility of the alleged violations resulting from the disciplinarysanctions, the respondent State argued that the applicants were not victims within themeaningof art.34. This was based on the fact that the university sanctions against the applicants hadbeen dismissed by the domestic courts and that, subsequently, the applicants had been ableto effectively attend their courses and sit their exams. They also considered that the applicantshad abused the right of petition because they had failed to mention the latter fact in theirapplication forms. The applicants rejected these arguments. Submitting that the effects ofthe sanctions, on their relationships with friends and family and in causing them to graduatea year later than their colleagues, had violated the Convention. The Court noted, with regardsto the applicants’ victim status, that a favourable domestic decision is not enough to deprivethe applicants of this status “unless the national authorities have acknowledged, eitherexpressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, the breach of the Convention”. Theafforded redress is required to be appropriate and sufficient. The Court found that the domesticdecisions of 12 and 19 December 2002 could be regarded as a sufficiently clearacknowledgement in substance that there had been an unjustified interference with theapplicants’ right to education. However, the Court held that the possibility of sitting repeatexams was not sufficient to deprive the applicants of victim status and that adequate redressin the present case would have been to award the applicants compensation. Having regardfor the domestic decisions between March 2007 and March 2008 to dismiss the applicants’claims for compensation the Court dismissed the respondent State’s objection, finding thatthe applicants can still claim to be victims of the alleged violations. Regarding the suggestedabuse of the right to petition the Court admitted that the applicants had failed to submit allof the relevant information in their applications, though found that this was not done withany intention to mislead the Court and thus dismissed the objection.(2) There had been a violation of art.2 of Protocol No.1 to the Convention (five votes to two).With regards to the merits of the first claim the Court reiterated that “access to any institutionof higher education existing at a given time is an inherent part of the right”. The Court notedthat this right is not universal, though any restrictions imposed should be foreseeable forthose concerned and pursue a legitimate aim.With the Court noting that, although disciplinarymeasures are not excluded by this right, any disciplinary measures “must not injure thesubstance of the right or conflict with other rights enshrined in the Convention”. In analysingthe facts, the Court found that the disciplinary measures afforded to the applicants constituteda restriction of their right to education and that the key issue was whether the measures wereproportionate. The Court observed that the applicants had not resorted “to violence or breachor attempt to breach the peace or order in the University” when petitioning the universityand were subject to the disciplinary measures simply for submitting their petitions. As aresult, the Court in agreement with Istanbul Administrative Court found that neither theviews expressed nor the means by which they were expressed warranted disciplinarysanctions. In coming to this finding, the Court specifically noted that although the sanctionsimposed by the university had subsequently been annulled domestically, this had failed toaddress the applicants’ grievances concerning the impact of the measures on themacademically.(3) The remainder of the application was inadmissible (unanimous).Case and Comment 191[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe Court then analysed the admissibility of the applicants’ second claim, which concernedan alleged violation of art.2 of Protocol No.1 read in the light of art.10 for a failure to providefor education in their mother tongue. The Court analysed this claim’s admissibility withregards to the six-month rule for introducing applications, noting that it had jurisdiction toconsider admissibility via the six-month rule of its ownmotion whether the respondent Statehad raised the objection or not. Additionally, the Court highlighted the interrelated natureof the six-month rule with the need for exhaustion of domestic remedies for admissibilityunder art.35(1). On the facts of the case, the Court noted that having not received an officialresponse to their original petitions, the applicants had not brought administrative proceedingswith the relevant national authorities after their petition had received a tacit refusal. Even ifbringing such a case had a remote chance of success the Court asserted that doing so wouldnot be futile as it would have postponed the beginning of the six-month period foradmissibility. Having failed to continue the case, the six-month rule came into effect, forthis claim, six months after the “tacit refusal” of their original petition. As a result, for theclaim to be admissible under art.35(1), the application would need to have been made in2001, with this leading the Court to unanimously reject this part of the application as it hadbeen introduced out of time. The applicants also had three additional complaints unanimouslyrejected concerning degrading treatment under art.3, an interference with their private andfamily life under art.8 and discrimination as a result of their Kurdish ethnic origin in violationof art.14.Cases consideredCampbell v United Kingdom (1982) 4 E.H.R.R. 293Centro Europa 7 S.r.l. v Italy [GC] (App. No.38433/09), judgment of 7 June 2012Hoffman Karlskov v Denmark (App. No.62560/00), judgment of 20 March 2003Hüttner v Germany (dec.)

Regarding thecharacterisation of the case, two of the judges rejected the majorities’ decision to examine the complaintunder art.2 of Protocol No.1 read in the light of art.10. In their opinion, the case should have beencharacterised solely under art.10 and concerning the applicants’ right to freedom of expression. This wasbased on their opinion that “the disciplinary sanctions were imposed first and foremost because of theopinion expressed in the applicants’ petition” and that, though the impact of their punishments indirectlyaffected their right to education, the direct effect of the punishments was on the applicants’ right to freedomof expression. In their dissenting opinion, the judges noted that they did “not think that these repercussionsare sufficient to consider that this complaint must be examined under art.2 of Protocol No.1”. The dissentingopinion seems to suggest that the characterisation of a case might influence the articles under which a192 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorscomplaint can be assessed. The dissenting judges also challenged the admissibility of the applicant’s claimunder art.2 of Protocol No.1. In their dissent, the judges concurred with the Istanbul District AdministrativeCourt that, having been re-enrolled and able to sit missed exams along with having the disciplinarymeasures dropped, the applicants had lost their victim status and been adequately redressed. It is noticeablethat the Court’s finding of a violation focused on the disciplinary measures being disproportionate to theapplicants’ actions of petitioning for Kurdish language classes, whereas the applicants’ prior domesticclaim for damages was based on both the social and psychological damage resulting from the disciplinaryactions along with denial of their right to education. Though the Court explicitly stated that “appropriateand adequate redress in the present case would have been to award the applicants compensation”, it isarguable that what warranted such redress was the damage resulting from the disciplinary actions ratherthan the actual disciplinary measures. The dissenting judges themselves noted that the deprivation ofuniversity access focused on by the Court “was not the kind of damage for which the applicants wereclaiming compensation before the domestic courts”. Deciding to examine the case predominantly underart.2 of Protocol No.1 could be seen as leading the Court to focus on compensation for the disciplinarymeasures themselves rather than the social and psychological effects the applicants had argued in thedomestic case.Prompt investigations and the right to lifeMurder—racist attack—racial motive—prompt investigation—victim’s relatives—right to life—art.2Criminal investigations; Criminal proceedings; Delay; Duty to undertake effective investigation;Greece; Murder; Racially aggravated offences; Right to lifeGjikondi v Greece (Application No.17249/10)European Court of Human Rights (First Section): Judgment of 21 December 2017FactsThe applicants, Ana Gjikondi, Sefit Berdellima, Violeta Berdellima and Ana Gjikondi, are Albaniannationals and are the relatives of Luan Berdellima who was killed on 25 August 2004 in Athens by anunidentified individual.On 11 August 2004, Luan Berdellima and two other Albanian nationals, VD and IS, while drinkingbeers outside a pizzeria in Athens, had a verbal altercation with IL who then left. Later in the day, LuanBerdellima returned to the pizzeria to meet again with his friend VD. Luan Berdellima was about to enterthe pizzeria when an unidentified man dismounted from a motorbike and hit him in the face. Theunidentified man left him lying unconscious on the ground. Luan Berdellima died of his injuries a fewdays later in the hospital.Following the death of Luan Berdellima, VD lodged a complaint against IL and the unidentified manwith the prosecutor of the Criminal Court, accusing them of having organised and committed the killingof his friend. He alleged that during the verbal altercation, IL had threatened the three Albanian nationalsthat he would make them regret to have ever set a foot on the Greek territory. On 30 August 2004, theSub-Directorate on Offences against Life and Property characterised the acts as homicide committed bytwo unidentified persons. The case was then transmitted to the prosecution which ordered an investigationto identify the perpetrators of the homicide. On 23 June 2005, the applicants applied to join the proceedingsas civil parties. In December 2007, the Indictments Division of the District Court decided to proceed withCase and Comment 193[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthe trial of IL. IL appealed against this decision before the Court of Appeal and the Cassation Court whichboth upheld the decision. The applicants allege that these decisions were never notified to them. On 15and 21 January 2008, hearings were held before the Assize Court in the absence of the applicants as wellas VD and IS, who, according to the applicants, had been intimidated and had decided to leave Greeceand return to Albania. On 12 February 2010, IL was acquitted due to a lack of evidence against him.In the meantime, three procedures had also been initiated: a procedure concerning alleged flaws in themain proceedings, an investigation into a police officer’s involvement in the crime, and an investigationinto alleged omissions by the judges responsible for the case. All of them were either discontinued orclassified.The applicants complained before the Court that art.2 (right to life), art.6 (right to a fair hearing), art.13(right to an effective remedy), and art.14 (prohibition of discrimination) had been breached.Held(1) There had been a violation of art.2 (unanimous).The Court found it unnecessary to consider the complaints under arts 6, 13 and 14.First, the Court analysed whether the investigation satisfied the procedural requirements ofart.2. The Court reiterated that it is essential, in the event of deaths in contentious situations,that the investigation be prompt. In the present case, the proceedings lasted five-and-a-halfyears and, in particular, the preliminary phase lasted four years and eight months. The Courtnoted that between 2005 and 2006, no investigative measures were taken by the competentauthorities. Moreover, IL, one of the principal suspects in the case, was only interrogatedtwo years after the events. Even though the present investigation was complicated andinvolved the testimony of witnesses living in Albania, the length of the preliminaryphase—including one year of inaction—was considered to have jeopardised the effectivenessof the investigation.In any case, the Court reiterated that the victim’s relatives must have been involved in theprocedure insofar as it is necessary to protect their legitimate interests. The Court noted thatthe applicants had not been properly informed on the progress of the case while it was theauthorities’ obligation to do so. In the present case, the applicants had declared their intentionto join the proceedings as civil parties. However, none of them were present during theproceedings before the Assize Court. Even though the Assize Court had summoned one ofthe applicants to appear in court, the Court considered that, due to the seriousness of thecrime, the Assize Court should have double-checked whether the applicant had lost interestin the matter and waived the right to be heard. The Assize Court also did not refer in itsjudgment to the applicants’ request to join the proceedings as civil parties. Moreover, theapplicants’ demands to obtain copies of various files concerning the case—notably filesrelative to the involvement of a police officer—were dismissed.Concerning the allegation that the crime had a racist motive, the Court noted that, from theoutset, the authorities had been informed of this possibility since VD had mentioned it inhis complaint. However, no actions had been undertaken by the competent authorities toinvestigate a possible racial crime. The Court noted in particular that IL had not beenquestioned on this matter and the authorities had not investigated whether he had in the pastbeen involved with extremist or racist groups. The Court considered that a detailedinvestigation on a possible racial motive should have been carried out by the authorities.(2) The Court found that Greece did not fail its obligation under art.34 (unanimous).194 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe Court considered it had already ruled on the applicants’ right to access the file concerningthe present case and that there is no evidence to conclude that the state had failed in itsobligations under art.34 (right of individual application).Cases consideredAnguelova v Bulgaria (2008) 47 E.H.R.R. 7Bekos v Greece (2006) 43 E.H.R.R. 2Edwards v United Kingdom (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 19Güleç v Turkey (1999) 28 E.H.R.R. 121İlhan v Turkey [GC] (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 36Iorga v Moldova (App. No.12219/05), judgment of 23 March 2010LCB v United Kingdom (1998) 27 E.H.R.R. 212MC v Bulgaria (2005) 40 E.H.R.R. 20McKerr v United Kingdom (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 20Menson v United Kingdom (2003) 37 E.H.R.R.

The need of a prompt investigation when a death occurs in contentiouscircumstances is essential. Indeed, the Court explained that the time elapsed between the crime and theinvestigations inevitably eroded the quantity and quality of available evidence, and the lack of diligenceof the authorities in that matter casts doubts on the good faith of the investigation. Secondly, the victim’srelatives must always be involved in the proceedings insofar as it is necessary to protect their interests.However, art.2 does not automatically entail a right for the victim’s relatives to have access to the casefile throughout the whole investigation. Article 2 does not impose an obligation on the authorities to satisfyevery investigation request of the victim’s relatives either. Finally, the Court reaffirmed that when a violentcrime is alleged to have racial motives, the state is obliged to take all necessary measures to establishwhether the crime was indeed racially motivated. This obligation, while it is one of means, is nonethelessessential for the protection of human rights against racist attacks.Harassment of a Roma Muslim familyThreats to physical and psychological integrity—Roma—Muslims—discrimination—right to family—art.8Duty to undertake effective investigation; Gypsies; Islam; Montenegro; Race discrimination; Rightto respect for private and family lifeAlković v Montenegro (Application No.66895/10)European Court of Human Rights (Second Section): Judgment of 5 December 2017Case and Comment 195[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsFactsThe applicant, Mr Rizo Alković, is a Muslim national of Montenegro of Romani origin born in 1960, whocurrently resides in Belgium. At the time of the events relevant to the case, he resided in Podgorica,Montenegro. He was living in an apartment building specifically for socially disadvantaged families since2006. Following attacks against the building in which his apartment and car sustained damage, he installeda camera.On 26 May 2009, the applicant’s next-door neighbour and another neighbour were watching a matchbetween Montenegrin and Bosnian boxers. When the Bosnian was on screen with his coaches of Muslimfaith, the applicant claims his next-door neighbour said he would slaughter one of them, to which the otherneighbour respondedwith a derogatory comment regarding the boxer’s Turkish background. The neighbourlater left his apartment and retrieved a gun from his car, to which the applicant’s next-door neighbour said“turn it to the left”—the direction of the applicant’s terrace. Approximately 10 gunshots were fired whilstthe next-door neighbour shouted insults about Mr Alković’s “Turkish mother”. Both neighbours’ familieslater collected the empty gun cartridges.On 9 September 2009, three neighbours, one of whomwas the wife ofMrAlković’s next-door neighbour,were talking on the terrace, a conversation the applicant overheard. The applicant heard that “cockroaches,frogs, nits and lice” brought in by “those dirty gypsies”. V also said they could use a “hammer and pruningknife and an axe” to which one neighbour retorted that her people “carried swords”. V said the axe wouldbe fine but the neighbour interjected again to say “no, no, he is a Muslim, I have a sword”, to which Vloudly stated “an axe, a sledgehammer, like the one used on pigs”.During an argument on 15 September 2009 with another neighbour, Mr Alković’s next-door neighbourwas heard to havemade remarks “dirty gypsy” and “trash” as he gestured towards the applicant’s apartment.The case-file does not specify whether the applicant witnessed the argument or was informed of thecomment by somebody else who was present.On 22 September 2009, the applicant was celebrating the religious holiday Ramadan Bayram, orEid-al-Fitr. A cross had been drawn on Mr Alković’s door with the message reading “move out or you’llbitterly regret it”. The police were called, who took photographs of the message and Mr Alković filed acriminal complaint against the families who had previously discriminated against him. In October 2009,all families were interviewed by the police, along with two other neighbouring families who had beenpresent or involved with the incidents occurring between May and September.Regarding the conversation and gunshots fired during the boxing match, both neighbours denied theyhad watched the match together and insisted everything said was aimed towards the Bosnian boxer. Theneighbours said they also heard gunshots but were not privy to who fired them and the children pickedup the spent cartridges simply to play with them, not to hide anything. With reference to the conversationon 9 September, one neighbour denied being in V’s apartment where V claimed they were discussing howthey would go about defending themselves should they come into contact with a perpetrator of attackswho the police were seeking at the time.Held(1) The application was admissible (unanimous).(2) There had been a violation of art.8 in conjunction with art.14 (unanimous).The Court used its previous judgments to deduce that art.8 includes a person’s physical andpsychological integrity, as well as ethnic identity. The Court reiterated that its task is not totake the place of the competent domestic authorities in determining the most appropriatemethods of protecting individuals from attacks on their personal integrity, but rather to196 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsreview under the Convention the decisions that those authorities have taken in the exerciseof their power of appreciation.In the present case, the Court found that the police did not carefully and promptly examinethe complaints brought by the applicant. The Court found that the prosecutor omitted theincident where gunshots were fired, despite it being confirmed by several sources. The policefailed to collect the spent bullets for analysis, which were available, so they could investigatewho fired the shots and why.The Court also noted that Montenegro has legislation in place that protects againstdiscrimination. According to the national Criminal Code, “whoever publicly encouragesviolence or hatred … on the basis of race, skin colour, religion, origin, or nationality shallbe sentenced” (art.370) and “whoever violates someone’s fundamental human rights andfreedoms on the basis of their race, skin colour, nationality, ethnic origin or other personalcharacteristic, shall be sentenced” (art.443). However, the Court found that the applicantdue to his ethnic and religious background could not be afforded effective protection underthe laws of the state, and the state therefore was expected to step up its efforts to protect theapplicant.Cases consideredAksu v Turkey (2013) 56 E.H.R.R. 4Aquilina v Malta (App. No.25642/94), judgment of 29 April 1999Balázs v Hungary (App. No.15529/12), judgment of 20 October 2015İlhan v Turkey (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 36Hajduová v Slovakia (2011) 53 E.H.R.R. 8Hoffmann v Austria (1994) 17 E.H.R.R. 293Jovanović v Serbia (2015) 61 E.H.R.R. 3Lepojić v Serbia (2008) 47 E.H.R.R. 56MC v Bulgaria (2005) 40 E.H.R.R. 20Nachova v Bulgaria (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 43S v United Kingdom (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 50Šečić v Croatia (2009) 49 E.H.R.R. 18Škorjanec v Croatia (App. No.25536/14), judgment of 28 March 2017Tavli v Turkey (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 11Von Hannover v Germany (2006) 43 E.H.R.R. 7Vučković v Serbia (2014) 59 E.H.R.R. 19CommentaryThe Court’s decision was unanimous, and the Court had no difficulties in finding a violation of art.8 inconjunction with art.14 on the basis of the facts. However, the stance of the Montenegrin Government israther surprising as they did not only fail to respond to the applicant’s complaints in first instance but alsoargued before the Court that the applicant’s evidence was unlawful. More specifically, when the applicanttried to rely on the footage of the camera installed outside his apartment to convince the police of thethreats against him and his family, including amongst others an attack against the applicant’s daughterwhich resulted in her being hospitalised, the government insisted that any footage collected by the applicantwas unlawfully obtained and therefore invalid. Of interest is also the intervention of the European RomaRights Centre (ERRC), which presented before the Court reports showing an increase in violence againstRoma in Europe. Evidence also showed that up to 43.5% of the people who participated in a survey inCase and Comment 197[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsMontenegro responded that they prefer not to have a neighbour or colleague of Roma origin or for thereto be no Roma even in the country at all. While the approach of the Court is to be welcome, the case alsomakes it clear that more is needed to tackle discrimination against Roma in Europe.198 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsBook ReviewTheory and Practice of the European Convention on Human Rights, 5th, by Pietervan Dijk (ed.), Fried van Hoof (ed.), Arjen van Rijn (ed.) and Leo Zwaak (ed.),(Intersentia, 2018), 1,230 pages, hardback, £166, ISBN: 978-1-78068-493-2.I must confess to being very interested in this latest edition. The second edition of the text had been myfirst serious introduction to the law of the European Convention on Human Rights and I had found it alittle intimidating (that was only 657 pages long, around half the length of this update). This is the fifthedition and the volume now has four editors and 28 contributors—with at least 27 PhDs, mostly professors,but I am glad to say with also a smattering of practising lawyers. It is a weighty tome but an expensivepurchase, at £166 for a hardback (with paperback copies, only available to students, at £52).The text is very accessible and the book’s structure is sensibly constructed with each chapter havingits own detailed list of contents with an index of over 15 pages. It is very easy to find your way aroundand to get specific answers to particular questions. In my opinion the book is worth purchasing just forits first two chapters, which, at over 271 pages, provide an excellent overview and detailed guide to theprocess and procedure of the European Court of Human Rights. It is also helpful to have such a detaileddescription of the role of the Committee of Ministers in Chapter 3 (including the more obscure role of theSecretary General of the Council of Europe). The only obvious competitor with these sections is “Takinga case to the European Court of Human Rights” by Phillip Leach, fourth edition published in August lastyear (and reviewed by Simon Creighton at [2017] E.H.R.L.R. 629).There is always the danger that new editions of old books are never really re-written (I have been guiltyof this) and can suffer from sections that need to be removed rather than having new extensions andannexes bolted on. I am glad to say that in the main this edition feels really fresh. Obviously veryoccasionally I had some differences of opinion with the authors—perhaps because some text has beenupdated and not rewritten. For instance, I am not sure that the importance, from 2014, of the new rulesrequiring those making an application to the Court to use its own application form and providing all thedetails and background papers before the six-month deadline (soon to be four months) rather than usingan old style introductory letter is stressed sufficiently.Having a chapter specifically on how the Court has interpreted the restrictions on the non-absoluterights is helpful to understand how arts 8–11 etc work in practice—prescribed by law; legitimate aim; andnecessary in a democratic society etc. The danger of this approach (not a fault of the authors) is that itsuggests a greater clarity of thought by the Court than may be justified, particularly because often theapproaches by the Court to these issues appear to vary from qualified article to article. There is no easyanswer to this except by covering these subjects both in a general chapter as well as in an article-by-articleanalysis—not an approach that can easily be justified in a single textbook.In fact, what impressed me most about this text was the article-by-article chapters. The descriptions ofarticles 2 and 3 were really excellent and easy to read and understand. Only a tiny point but in relation tothe “investigatory duty” there was no reference to the duty in art.3 being derived from the duty found bythe Court in art.2 (Assenov v Bulgaria at [102]).Inevitably, comparisons with other textbooks designed for similar audiences will be made and thereare now quite a few alternatives to chose from, all of which are very good, for instance: Schabas (TheEuropean Convention on Human Rights: A Commentary), the most recently published competitor; Harris,O’Boyle and Warbrick (Law of the European Convention on Human Rights) (now 2014 but veryinexpensive): Reid (A Practitioner’s Guide to the European Convention on Human Rights); or Jacobs,White and Ovey (The European Convention On Human Rights).199[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe numbers of cases that emanate from the European Court of Human Rights every year makes it verydifficult to keep up to date with the law of the ECHR, finding something that is accurate, has the verylatest cases and is accessible is not easy. This is despite the fact that the HUDOC website is now veryimpressive and can even be used to search for specific words across the whole of the jurisprudence.This book also helps in that struggle. In practice, many lawyers who specialise in this area will buymore than one of these guides. It helps with keeping up to date because the publication dates for theseguides are often unintentionally staggered and, hopefully, at least one of the guides on your shelf will onlybe a year or so out of date. My vote is still for Harris, O’Boyle and Warbrick—if you can only afford oneof them. On a spot check between the two publications on art.5 this new book has a clearer structure butHarris et al. has 82 pages on the subject and 755 footnotes compared with 56 pages and only 291 footnotes.However this new book’s chapter on art.6 is twice as long as the Harris text—so even an arithmeticalassessment is difficult.Being up to date though is obviously important—and the Harris book is now several years old. I waspleased to see some consideration of all the recent and important cases coming out of the Court in thisedition. To take an example close to my heart: Ibrahim v United Kingdom (2016) and Simeonovi v Bulgaria(2017) which involve restrictions on access to lawyers in police stations are included. In my opinion boththese cases undermine the very protections I thought were intended to be included by art.6(3) and theCourt’s interpretation of them in Salduz v Turkey [GC]. In my view the Court took a wrong turning withthese recent cases and they are analysed accurately by the editors of this volume. However, there appearsto be no authorial comment, despite the fact that that there is considerable disquiet about these cases andthe Court’s direction of travel, see, for instance, one of the dissents in the case of Ibrahim itself:“the Court itself waters down rights, by failing to adhere to the guarantees of Article 6 as interpretedin its own well-established case-law, and without expressly stating it, de facto departs from thatearlier well-established case-law, which has been widely applied by the national courts. This is mostdisappointing. A human-rights court must not relinquish a level of protection that it has alreadygranted”(Dissenting Opinion of Judges Sajó and Laffranque at [2]).I am sure some lawyers prefer their textbooks free of comment but I am afraid I do not.In other sections, the authors are helpfully critical. For instance, in commenting on the ability of theCourt to reject cases before they are properly considered, on the basis that they are “manifestly ill-founded”,the authors state:“For a proper discharge of that function no more is needed than the power to reject those applicationsthe ill-founded nature character of which is actually manifest. In several cases, however, theCommission (sic) has used this competence in a way which clearly went beyond this”(p.168).A great book that needs to be on your shelves but it remains difficult to justify the expense if you alreadyhave the latest version of one of its competitors.John Wadham200 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsOpinionThe Airspace Tribunal: Towards a New HumanRight to Protect the Freedom to Exist WithoutPhysical or Psychological Threat from AboveNick GriefShona IllingworthAndrew HoskinsMartin A. Conway*Airspace; Human rights; International law; TribunalsAbstractOver the last century, humans have radically transformed airspace: chemically, territorially, militarilyand psychologically. Technological developments mean that this transformation is accelerating andgrowing in complexity. There is widening disparity in the global landscape of power, with civiliansincreasingly subject to expanding commercial and military exploitation of technology in airspace andouter space and to the consequences of environmental change. The associated threats are not adequatelyaddressed by the contemporary legal framework. There is an urgent need for new thinking. One aspectof airspace requiring development is the human rights dimension. The Airspace Tribunal will considerthe case for and against the recognition of a new human right to protect the freedom to exist withoutphysical or psychological threat from above. Drawing on wide expertise and experience, it will engagethe public in discussion and seek to challenge the narrow terms by which airspace is represented anddefined in law.Later this year, a people’s tribunal will begin to consider the case for and against the recognition of a newhuman right to protect the freedom to exist without physical or psychological threat from above. Thehypothesis that this new right demands recognition will be tested at the Airspace Tribunal, a series ofinternational public hearings beginning in London with further hearings anticipated in locations aroundthe world. The Tribunal will invite representations from experts across a broad range of disciplines, sectorsand lived experience, such as human rights, contemporary warfare, new media ecologies, environmentalchange, neuropsychology, conflict and forced migration. These representations will engage the public indialogue and debate about the rapidly changing composition and nature of airspace, consider futurepressures/impacts and interrogate and challenge the narrow terms by which airspace is currently definedand represented in law.*Nick Grief is a Professor at Kent Law School, University of Kent and an associate tenant at Doughty Street Chambers; Shona Illingworth is anartist and Reader in Fine Art, School of Music and Fine Art, University of Kent; Andrew Hoskins is a media sociologist and Interdisciplinary ResearchProfessor of Global Security in the College of Social Sciences, University of Glasgow; and Martin A. Conway is a cognitive neuropsychologist andDirector of the Centre for Memory and Law, City, University of London.201[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe current regime of airspace and why it needs reimaginingEstablished legal frameworks for defining airspace rely on an older Cartesian model where airspace isviewed as open and empty and is mapped out in territorial zones: “Airspace is a concept used to signifythe spatial dimension where States exercise their jurisdiction or control for aviation and defence…Airspacerefers to a domain, an area-based approach”.1 However, this does not account for the complex and diverseways in which the sky is utilised, impacted on or exploited, or for how it is valued, understood andexperienced across different cultures. Furthermore, in the context of accelerating geopolitical, technologicaland environmental change, we need to radically reassess how we perceive airspace in the legal sense.Under international law as recognised by art.1 of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation1944,2 every state has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory. For acoastal state like the UK, this means sovereignty over the airspace above its land territory and territorialwaters.3 Beyond the territorial sea are other maritime zones with specific legal regimes but the generalprinciple is that the legal status of airspace reflects that of the subjacent land or sea.4 Over the high seas,which are open to all states, the freedom of aviation prevails.5 However, it is generally recognised that ininternational airspace states can establish temporary restricted or danger areas for peaceful (i.e.non-aggressive) purposes6 subject to the requirement of reasonableness in terms of extent and time.7Beyond airspace is outer space which, as declared by art.II of the Outer Space Treaty 1967,8 is not subjectto national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.The boundary between airspace and outer space has not yet been defined but the resolution of that issueis less urgent than howwe protect individuals’ health and wellbeing in the space above our heads, regardlessof the latter’s legal status.A key aspect of the legal framework of airspace in need of further development is the human rightsdimension. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 19489 and regional instruments such as theEuropean Convention on Human Rights10 marked the inception of modern international human rightslaw.11 Since then, human rights have continued to evolve but gaps remain. One such gap relates to airspace.In short, there is a human right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions12 but there is not yet a humanright to the peaceful enjoyment of airspace, protecting us from physical or psychological threat fromabove. It should be noted that what is being proposed is not an absolute right but a qualified one; i.e. aright the enjoyment of which can be restricted provided that the limitation is prescribed by law andnecessary in a democratic society for the achievement of a legitimate aim such as national security, publicsafety or to protect the rights and freedoms of others.13 While it might be argued that what is advocatedhere is already covered by the right to life or the right to respect for private life,14 there are compellingreasons for specifically recognising this proposed new human right.There is precedent for human rights which were once subsumed within broader rights or freedomsbecoming specifically identified and explicitly protected as thinking evolves, such as freedom of the arts1UN General Assembly, Doc.A/CN.4/667, International Law Commission, First Report on the protection of the atmosphere prepared by Mr ShinyaMurase, Special Rapporteur, paras 80 and 81 (footnotes omitted), http://legal.un.org/docs/?symbol=A/CN.4/667 [Accessed 25 May 2018].2 15 UNTS 295 (Chicago Convention).3Chicago Convention art.2. See also the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS) art.24 See, e.g. Nicholas Grief, Public International Law in the Airspace of the High Seas (Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhoff, 1994).5UNCLOS art.87(1)(b).6UNCLOS art.88 provides: “The high seas shall be reserved for peaceful purposes.” Given the reference to “the Purposes and Principles of theUnited Nations” (UNCLOS, preamble, 7th recital) and in the light of state practice, it is clear that in this context “peaceful” means non-aggressiverather than non-military.7Grief, Public International Law in the Airspace of the High Seas (1994), pp.58–61.8 610 UNTS 205.9UN General Assembly resolution 217 A, 10 December 1948.10ETS No.5.11Vaughan Lowe, International Law (Oxford: OUP, 2007), pp.11–12.12ECHR art.1 of Protocol 1.13Rosalind English and Philip Havers QC (eds), An Introduction to Human Rights and the Common Law (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2000), pp.19–26.14ECHR arts 1 and 8.202 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsand sciences.15 So too with the freedom to look up and not feel threatened, which is fundamental to healthand life. During armed conflict, moreover, this new human right would provide a clearer reference pointfor the operation of international humanitarian law and help to determine the latter’s content. If the freedomto look up and not feel threatened were specifically recognised in international human rights law, thismight enhance protection under the law of armed conflict, the lex specialis which regulates the conductof hostilities,16 and help to make that law more effective.Over the last century, humans have radically transformed airspace’s composition: chemically, territorially,militarily and psychologically.With current and anticipated technological developments, this transformationis accelerating and gaining in complexity. This represents a rapidly growing disparity in the global landscapeof power, where civilians—including unprecedented numbers of displaced people—are increasinglysubject to expanding commercial and military exploitation of technology in airspace and outer space andto the consequences of environmental change. The associated threats are not adequately accounted for bythe legal framework defined by the contemporary international law of airspace.This disparity has grown significantly since the early 20th century, which saw a radical shift in theterms of conflict with the first full-scale deployment of airborne chemical warfare at the Second Battle ofYpres on 22 April 1915.17 Thirty years later, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed by atomic bombs.From 1946 to 1958, while administered by the US under UN trusteeship, the Marshall Islands was thelocation of repeated nuclear weapons testing by the US. During that period, 67 nuclear weapons weredetonated there and the devastating impact of those nuclear substances and wastes continues to this day.18What the Marshallese people lost included the freedom to look up and not feel threatened. In his poignantopening statement to the International Court of Justice inMarshall Islands v Pakistan on 8 March 2016,19the Marshall Islands’ Co-Agent and ex-Foreign Minister, Tony de Brum, recalled how, as a nine year oldboy, he had seen children playing in the radioactive dust that fell from the skies:“Yesterday was a beautiful morning here in The Hague that featured a picture-perfect snowfall. Asa tropical state, the Marshall Islands has experienced ‘snow’ on one memorable and devastatingoccasion, the 1954 Bravo test of a thermonuclear bomb that was one thousand times the strength ofthe Hiroshima bomb. When that explosion occurred, there were many people, including children,who were a far distance from the bomb, on our atolls which, according to leading scientists andassurances, were predicted to be entirely safe. In reality, within five hours of the explosion, it beganto rain radioactive fallout on Rongelap. Within hours, the atoll was covered with a fine, white,powdered-like substance. No one knew it was radioactive fallout. The children thought it was snow.And the children played in the snow. And the children ate the snow. So one can understand that snow,while beautiful, has a tragic and dark history in the Marshall Islands.”There has been a rapidly increasing trajectory of large-scale human vulnerability to the weaponisationof airspace, pervasive transformation of its composition and use, and significant environmental impacts.The scale and dimension of these impacts also require new thinking. For example, Svetlana Alexievichhas identified the Chernobyl disaster as “a catastrophe of time”20:15Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union art.13.16 Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 1996, p.226, para.25.17 Peter Sloterdijk, Terror from the Air (Los Angeles, CA: Semiotext(e), 2009). On p.14, Sloterdijk describes this attack as a radical shift towards“targeting no longer the body, but the enemy’s environment”.18Report of the Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardoussubstances and wastes, Calin Georgescu; Addendum, Mission to the Marshall Islands (27–30 March 2012) and the United States of America (24–27April 2012): 3 September 2012, Doc.A/HRC/21/48/Add.1, paras 1–19.19See http://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/159/159-20160308-ORA-01-00-BI.pdf [Accessed 25May 2018]. This was one of three cases in whichthe Marshall Islands contended that nuclear-armed India, Pakistan and the UK are in breach of obligations concerning good faith disarmamentnegotiations. On 5 October 2016 the Court controversially decided that it could not proceed to the merits.20 Svetlana Alexievich, Chernobyl Prayer (London: Penguin Modern Classics, 2016, new translation by Anna Gunin and Arch Tait), p.24.Opinion 203[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors“The image of the adversary had changed. We’d acquired a new enemy. Or rather enemies. Now wecould be killed by cut grass, a caught fish or game bird. By an apple. The world around us, oncepliant and friendly, now instilled fear. Elderly evacuees, who had not yet understood they were leavingforever, looked up at the sky: ‘The sun is shining. There’s no smoke or gas, nobody is shooting. Itdoesn’t look like war, but we have to flee like refugees.’ A world strange yet familiar.”21In 2013, the International Law Commission decided to include “The Protection of the Atmosphere” inits programme of work and appointed a Special Rapporteur with a view to producing a set of draft articleson the topic.22 In his first report, the Special Rapporteur distinguishes between airspace and the atmosphere:“Airspace refers to a domain, an area-based approach; the atmosphere, in contrast, is a natural resourcethat flows through national boundaries … Thus, the atmosphere is a fluid, single and non-partitionableunit, whereas airspace is a static—and separable—spatial domain”.23 Nevertheless, recognising that statesmay want reassurance that their “complete and exclusive sovereignty” over the airspace above theirterritory will not be compromised, he proposes the inclusion of a saving clause to the effect that nothingin the draft guidelines shall affect the legal status of airspace provided in other conventions.24The relationship between the rules of international law relating to the protection of the atmosphere andother relevant rules of international law, including human rights law, is also addressed. Draft guidelinenine (“Interrelationship among relevant rules”) provides that states should “to the extent possible, whendeveloping new rules of international law relating to the protection of the atmosphere and other relevantrules of international law, endeavour to do so in a harmonious manner”;25 and that “special considerationshould be given to persons and groups particularly vulnerable to atmospheric pollution and atmosphericdegradation”. It adds: “Such groups may include, inter alia, indigenous people, people of the least developedcountries and people of small-island and low-lying States affected by sea-level rise”.26 So there areinteresting connections between the ILC’s ongoing work on the protection of the atmosphere and theAirspace Tribunal initiative to develop and recognise a new human right to protect the freedom to existwithout physical or psychological threat from above. Even though the Special Rapporteur is emphasisingthe domain or area-based approach to airspace and safeguarding the sovereignty principle reaffirmed bythe Chicago Convention, it will be important for the proposed new human right and the new rules ofinternational law on the protection of the atmosphere to be developed “in a harmonious manner” and withparticular regard to especially vulnerable individuals and groups.Another of the ILC’s current topics, “The protection of the environment in relation to armed conflicts”,27recognises that during the 20th century “technological development placed the environment at a greaterrisk of being permanently destroyed through destruction caused by nuclear weapons or other weapons ofmass destruction, but also through destruction caused by conventional means and methods of warfare”.28Such developments and the associated risks continue unabated. In February 2018 the Pentagon announcedthat “[e]xpanding flexible US nuclear options now, to include low-yield options, is important for thepreservation of credible deterrence against regional aggression”.29 Soon afterwards came Russia’sannouncement that it had developed new nuclear delivery systems capable of evading US defences.30 Atthe same time, the space above us is the location of increasingly complex weapons systems trials, advances21Alexievich, Chernobyl Prayer (2016, new translation by Anna Gunin and Arch Tait), p.28.22Doc.A/CN.4/667, para. 4,23Doc.A/CN.4/667, para.81 (footnotes omitted).24Doc.A/CN.4/667, para. 83.25Doc.A/CN.4/667, para 2.26Doc.A/CN.4/667, para 3.27 See http://legal.un.org/ilc/summaries/8_7.shtml [Accessed 25 May 2018].28Doc.A/66/10, Annex E, para.4.29US Department of Defense, Nuclear Posture Review (February 2018), Executive Summary, p.XII: https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872886/-1/-1/1/2018-NUCLEAR-POSTURE-REVIEW-FINAL-REPORT.PDF [Accessed 25 May 2018].30 “Russia’s Putin unveils ‘invincible’ nuclear weapons”, BBC News, 1 March 2018, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43239331 [Accessed25 May 2018].204 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsin geotracking, surveillance and satellite warfare. At this critical juncture, expertise from across a rangeof disciplines is required to respond to these developments and ensure adequate representation for thosewhose rights are affected. In advocating the development and recognition of this new human right, theAirspace Tribunal will facilitate new dialogues, stimulate new critical thinking and propose new approachesto deal with the current and future pressures on airspace. It will also examine the efficacy of current formsof representationwithin the legal framework, seeking to ensure agency and voice across a wider constituencyof experience and expertise.Contexts and scenarios demonstrating the need for new thinkingThe following contexts and scenarios demonstrate the need for radical new thinking in this area:1. Each year, vast areas of airspace over the north of Scotland and extending out over the NorthAtlantic are occupied by NATO Member States for military exercises (e.g. Operation JointWarrior)31 and by commercial organisations for weapons testing (e.g. Operation UnmannedWarrior).32 While the expansion and use of these “Danger Areas” have far-reachingconsequences, public consultation has only addressed their economic and environmentalimpacts and then only in very narrow terms.33 The scope of such consultation needs to becommensurate with the complexities and reach of the impacts.2. The psychological impact of aerial bombardment and of the fear of attack from above, whilstacknowledged, is not yet adequately understood. The advent of such bombardment a centuryago “created hopelessly unequal new power relationships between warrior high above andvictim below … The dread of random death from above became a psychological weaponin itself … Each technological breakthrough intruded war’s terror deeper into the anxietiesand fantasies of civilians”.34 With the significant shift to the weaponisation of airspace andouter space, and the rapid development of technology allowing the maintenance of airbornethreats indefinitely, the impact on civilian populations of sustained threat of attack from theair (e.g. through drone warfare, chemical weapons and anti-satellite weapons systems) andits longer-term psychological and physical consequences require greater understanding andrecognition in the legal context, including new approaches to the gathering and presentationof evidence.This is especially crucial for the growing numbers of civilians who are displaced anddisenfranchised through war, conflict or environmental disaster. In a 12-month periodbetween 2015 and 2016, over 1.2 million people applied for asylum in the EU alone. Thiswas the largest movement of people in Europe since the Second World War.35 The majorityhad been displaced by war and conflict in which large civilian populations had been subjectto attack from the air. As Alison Abbott has observed, although the crisis has attracted globalattention and sparked political tension, “[w]hat hasn’t been widely discussed is the enormousburden of mental-health disorders in migrants and refugees”.36 Citing work published by theAmerican Psychiatric Association, Emily Holmes makes a related point: “Even once in a31 See http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0052/00525162.pdf [Accessed 25 May 2018].32 See https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/operations/uk-home-waters/unmanned-warrior [Accessed 25 May 2018].33Demonstrated by Sneddon Economics,MOD Missile Test Range Uists, Economic Impact Assessment, 19 August 2009, report commissioned byHighlands & Islands Enterprise (HIE) on behalf of the Hebrides Range Task Force, and by the CAA Decision Letter, https://www.caa.co.uk/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=4294972710 [Accessed 25 May 2018].34 From “The Unconscious Life of Bombs”, BBC Radio 4, 11 December 2017, presented by Daniel Pick (Birkbeck).35Alison Abbott, “The Troubled Mind of Migrants” (2016) 538 Nature 158.36Abbott, “The Troubled Mind of Migrants” (2016) 538 Nature 158.Opinion 205[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorssafe country, refugees are often plagued by vivid mental images of traumatic events—called‘intrusive memories’—that repeatedly spring to mind unbidden”.37Of particular importance, and currently unknown, is whether there are any specialpsychological features of suffering attack from the air. Perhaps the frequency of generalisedanxiety disorder (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is more common followingsuch attacks compared to other types of attack? Currently, we simply do not know. Therapid expansion of the weaponisation of airspace could lead to distinctive psychologicalconditions requiring new therapeutic interventions. Recognition of this proposed new humanright could help to stimulate new knowledge in this field. A better understanding of thepsychological impacts is also critical to more effective representation within the legal context.3. A review of the human rights dimension of airspace is further necessitated by thetransformations in proximity and distance in contemporary warfare. As new technologiesfacilitate a “militarized regime of hypervisibility”,38 enabling an increasingly remote meansof locating and killing enemies, the co-presence of journalists and others charged withdocumenting the threats and effects of warfare is increasingly compromised. Reflecting onhis work as a landscape photographer recording the aftermath of conflict, Simon Norfolkhas highlighted the challenge of using more traditional methods to document contemporaryforms of war: “How do you photograph a drone flying over Yemen at 40,000 feet and firinga missile into a car in the middle of nowhere? You can’t photograph it. How do youphotograph satellite warfare or submarine systems, or cyberwarfare? That’s how the war ofthe future is being fought, that is where the money is being spent … I don’t know how tophotograph any of that stuff”.39Against this background, developing forensic practices acrossinterdisciplinary teams of expertise, such as those exemplified by Forensic Architecture,40to gather, analyse and present evidence in the complex domain of contemporary and futureconflict will become increasingly necessary, as will the legal framework to consider this.4. A human right to protect the freedom to exist without physical or psychological threat fromabove also needs to accommodate the risk posed to individuals by their inadvertent exposureas targets. For instance, geolocation features pervasive in smartphones and increased searchengine power in sifting and mapping geotagged photographs reveal a person’s “patterns oflife”. A recent example was the release in November 2017 of Strava’s data visualisationmap of uses of the company’s fitness tracking app used on a variety of devices (smartphonesand fitness trackers). More than 1 billion activities uploaded to Strava were suddenly madeavailable on its global heatmap comprising more than 3 trillion individual data points. Earlyin 2018 it became apparent that the jogging routes of foreign military personnel and theinternal layouts of their bases in Afghanistan and Syria had been revealed, in a new risk totheir operational security.41The Airspace Tribunal processConceived by Grief and Illingworth, the Airspace Tribunal will draw together a wide range of expertiseand lived experience to argue the case for and against the recognition of this new human right.

Goldston*Shirley Pouget**European Court of Human RightsMy organisation, the Open Society Justice Initiative, litigates and undertakes legal advocacy to advancehuman rights and the rule of law around the globe. But we have deep roots in, and an unshakeablecommitment to, the human rights system in Europe, where Open Society Foundations was born.We are not only ardent supporters of the European Convention on Human Rights, we are also activeusers of the European Court and have litigated a number of its most important cases. We are invested inthe Court’s independence, effectiveness and long-term well-being. We believe that the strength of theCourt, while dependent upon many factors, derives in large part from the quality of its judgments—andthe extent to which they are implemented. For this reason, we have insisted on the importance of execution,and have advocated for strong supervision mechanisms within the Committee of Ministers and robustexecution efforts at the national level.The future of the European Human Rights Convention system has been the subject of continuous,intense intergovernmental scrutiny, with four official declarations and two new Protocols adopted in eightyears. In each case, with the exception of the Brussels Declaration, legitimate efforts to strengthen theCourt and the Convention system have coincided with over-reach—that is, inappropriate attempts by someto use the language of “reform” as a mask to narrow the Court’s role.The process leading up to this year’s Copenhagen Declaration under the Danish chairmanship of theCouncil of Europe has exhibited a similar dual tendency. On the one hand, many states have admirablyfocused on the necessary and laudable aim of assuring the “sustainable functioning of the control mechanismof the Convention”, including by guaranteeing the Court the necessary resources to continue its progressin reducing the backlog of cases. But, on the other hand, there were attempts in the course of the pastseveral months to insert language into the Declaration that would have compromised the Court’sindependence, unduly constrained its remit and wrongly signalled that it was “unrealistic” for the Courtto address large-scale rights violations or that the Court should “avoid intervening” in most asylum orimmigration cases.We and other civil society actors and academics objected to these proposals. We warned that efforts toexpand the notion of “dialogue” between Member States and the Court beyond the many fruitfulopportunities for interaction that currently exist risked “politicising” the Court and infringing on its judicialauthority and independence. And we observed that some suggestions to expand the principle of subsidiaritywere misguided, insofar as they improperly inserted into a political Declaration guidance for how theCourt should interpret concepts such as the “margin of appreciation,” and in doing so, failed to clarify*Executive Director, Open Society Justice Initiative, and Adjunct Professor of Law, NYU Law School.**Advocacy officer, Open Society Justice Initiative.[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors208that states do not always have a margin of appreciation and that the scope of the margin, if any, is to bedetermined by the Court, not states.It should be noted that civil society raised these concerns even though most of its representatives werenot generally privy to inter-state discussions, and were not given the opportunity to comment on severalof the draft declarations that emerged. Thankfully, many of the most problematic proposals provokedconsternation among Council of Europe members as well.Thus, a coalition of 19 states expressed serious reservations about the way one earlier draft during thenegotiations downplayed the Court’s supervisory functions, questioned its independence and authority,revisited well-established principles of dynamic interpretation of the Convention, and undermined theprinciple of universality of human rights.As a result, the final Copenhagen Declaration adopted this April is in far better shape than some hadfeared. While brief, the Declaration includes two paragraphs noting the importance of the execution ofjudgments at the national level, and reinforces the responsibilities of states as first responders insafeguarding, preventing and addressing violations of the Convention. And while the Declaration clearlypoints to the need for improved Court functioning (through greater clarity and consistency of judgments,addressing the large caseload and ensuring the highest quality judges), it also recognises the Court’sultimate authority to determine whether the Convention has been violated. The Declaration helpfullyaffirms the “shared responsibility” of the Court and Member States to fully and effectively implement theConvention at the national level.However, given that examination of the Court and the Convention system more broadly will continueafter Copenhagen—the Brussels Declaration envisions an analysis, by the end of 2019, of the prospectsof obtaining a balanced caseload—all parties might benefit from reflection now on how that process couldbe improved. Here are three areas where we can do better.First, efforts by some states to diminish the Court’s authority have been “politically” motivated—theywere designed to appeal to surging nationalist currents among domestic constituencies. It is no secret thathuman rights are on the defensive across much of Europe—and in the world at large. In the face of suchpressure, it may be tempting to parrot the fabrications of populist figures, such as that rights are an elitistinvention for terrorists and immigrants, but not for everyone else.But the past few years have taught that, rather than succumb, political leaders combat populist nationalismmost effectively when they stand up for the core principles of the Convention—including the rule of law,tolerance of difference and equal opportunity. The most successful politicians are able to explain to theircitizens in plain terms why rights matter for all.Just look at the experience of court systems outside Europe. Several years ago, the Southern AfricanDevelopment Community Tribunal came under withering attack for some of its initial decisions. No statedefended it—and it collapsed.By contrast, continent-wide regional mechanisms in Africa and Latin America have experienced severeblowback in recent years. But in both cases, a number of governments have pushed back and in the processsecured broader support for the institutions and political benefit for themselves. Similarly, when, a littleover a year ago, the International Criminal Court faced a wave of threatened withdrawals, several states,backed by civil society, spoke up in defence of the Court and its mission. Although challenges remain foreach of these bodies, they have survived to fight another day.Conversely, when governments who have been longstanding rights champions falter, other statesnotice—and the impacts resonate across borders. Several years ago, Kenya’s leadership seized uponBritain’s vocal criticism of the European Court to justify their own self-interested attacks on the ICC.The lesson is clear—defending rights and the institutions which protect them demands political dedicationand courage, not cowardice.Point of View 209[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsA second insight is that the Copenhagen process might have built more effectively on the BrusselsDeclaration, which, despite its excellent language, has had little practical impact thus far. The CopenhagenDeclaration might have proposed concrete measures to improve the execution of judgments. Thus, it mighthave encouraged the Court to craft judgments identifying specific measures and a timeframe for executingjudgments; or urged the Committee of Ministers to develop a set of progressive actions to respond tonon-execution of judgments, such as public hearings, referring non-implemented cases to the ParliamentaryAssembly for debate, in situ missions, and greater use of infringement proceedings under art.46(4); ornoted the possibility of financial sanctions for failure to execute judgments. Post-Copenhagen reviewsshould consider taking up these points.Finally, any future examination of the European Convention system should ensure that civil society isconsidered an indispensable partner. The Copenhagen Declaration (at para.33) makes clear that “civilsociety should be involved” in the ongoing dialogue between States Parties and the Court on their respectiveroles in implementing the Convention system. But going forward, the commitment to engage civil societyas a full and equal actor must be translated into concrete measures. So, for example, consultations on newprocedures andworkingmethods should involve, not only the Registry and government agents (as para.37(c)of the Declaration notes), but representatives of applicants and NGOs as well. Last-minute, token invitationsto a few NGOs to attend, but not speak at, government-dominated conferences will not suffice. Moregenerally, follow-on efforts to achieve full implementation of the Convention must be seen as a “sharedresponsibility” of not only the Council of Europe and its Member States, but of civil society organisationsas well.In short, the Copenhagen process, which once threatened to pose a real challenge to the Court, hasended in a relatively positive place. But rather than offering congratulations, it is essential to take stockof what could have gone better, and of how to ensure that the next round of this recurring examination ofthe Convention system is aimedmore clearly at preserving and strengthening the jewel of regional judicialbodies.210 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsBulletin:

Theyargued that their claims were not sufficiently considered by the contested decision but theCourt held there was no breach of the Charter.Articles 42 and 47• Edeka-Handelsgesellschaft Hessenring v Commission (T-611/15), 5 February 2018, theclaimant requested access to documents for a decision concerning a cartel between banksin the euro interest rate derivatives sector (EIRD), which was rejected. They contested thisdecision on the grounds that there were not adequate reasons stated, especially for refusingaccess to the table of contents. The claim was rejected as the documents were protectedunder a general presumption of confidentiality.Article 47• POA v Commission (T-74/16), 8 February 2018, the claimant requested access to documentsconcerning registration of halloumi cheese as a protected designation of origin and wasgranted only partial access.

Theclaimant argued that this was against the free movement of services, capital, the right toproperty, and the right to a fair trial. It was held that restrictions on the free movement ofcapital could not be justified, so fundamental rights did not need to be considered.Article 21• Stollwitzer (C-482/16), 14 March 2018, the claimant worked for the predecessor ofÖBB-Personenverkehr AG and their scheme of advancing pay scales did not take into accountperiods of time worked before the age of 18. When rules changed to eliminate agediscrimination, they were retroactively applied. The claimant sought this lost payment buthad no proof of service, so his claimwas dismissed. It was held that allowing only experienceacquired with other undertakings operating in the same economic sector to be taken intoaccount for retroactive claims was acceptable.Article 47• Associação Sindical dos Juízes Portugueses (C-64/16), 27 February 2018, Portuguese lawallowed the temporary reduction of salaries to eliminate excessive budget deficits, whichalso affected judges.

Helm sought market authorisation in2012 from the Finnish Medicines Agency for Alkybend, a generic product whose referenceproduct was Levact, but stated that Ribomustin should be the reference product for theapplicable data exclusivity period. Alkybend was granted the authorisation with Ribomustinas the reference product. The claimant contested this decision, and it was held there wasjurisdiction to determine the period of data exclusivity as concerns which reference product.Articles 47 and 48• Sporting Odds (C-3/17), 28 February 2018, the claimant offered online games in Hungarybut did not have a licence to do so there. A fine was imposed by the Hungarian Tax Authorityfor not having this licence without informing Sporting Odds of their investigation.

We willfirst touch briefly on the history and origins of Protocol No.16 (Section II), the aims which this newadvisory procedure is meant to achieve (Section III), before proceeding to distinguish between thecharacteristics of the new procedure (Section IV) and procedural issues relating to their future treatmentwithin the Court (Section V).I. IntroductionOn 12 April 2018, France became the tenth High Contracting Party to the European Convention on HumanRights to deposit its instrument of ratification of Protocol No.16 to the Convention. As a consequence,Protocol No.16 will enter into force on 1 August 2018.1 As most readers will be aware, Protocol No.16will extend the advisory jurisdiction of the Court, allowing it to provide advisory opinions, at the requestof identified courts of the State Parties to the Protocol, on “questions of principle relating to theinterpretation or application of the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention or the Protocols thereto”.2It should come as no surprise that the Court has for some time been engaged in the necessary preparatorywork for the Protocol’s entry into force. As a result of this process, the Court’s plenary has already adoptedboth the necessary amendments to the Court’s Rules of Procedure as well as non-binding Guidelines onthe implementation of this new procedure. The latter Guidelines are intended to offer practical assistanceto those courts and tribunals with competence to submit a request for an advisory opinion on the initiationof the request and the procedure to be followed.*We are very grateful to Caoimhe Tierney, lawyer at the Court’s Registry, for her invaluable help with this article. The views expressed article arepurely personal to the authors.1Article 8(1) of Protocol No.16. The other nine states which have so far ratified the Protocol are Albania, Armenia, Estonia, Finland, Georgia,Lithuania, SanMarino, Slovenia and Ukraine. A further nine states have signed it. Press reports suggest that the ratification procedures in the Netherlandsand Iceland are also at an advanced stage. Article 6 emphasises that acceptance of Protocol No.16 is optional (see further below) and the latter doesnot have the effect of introducing new provisions into the ECHR for those High Contracting Parties that do not accept it.2 See below for further discussion of this criterion. Provision for advisory opinions is of course already made in arts 47–49 of the Convention butboth those who can request such opinions (the Committee of Ministers), and the scope of what they may cover, are restricted. Two such requests weremade up until 2008 and only one was accepted by the Court.[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors220This article will focus on some key issues relating to the entry into force of the Protocol, the natureand effects of future advisory opinions and some procedural questions to which they may give rise. Wewill first touch briefly on the history and origins of Protocol No.16 (Section II), the aims which this newadvisory procedure is meant to achieve (Section III), before proceeding to distinguish between thecharacteristics of the new procedure (what the Explanatory Report refers to as “key parameters”) (SectionIV) and procedural issues relating to their future treatment within the Court (Section V).3As serving judges, we do not perceive our role as being in any way to applaud or, on the other hand,criticise the Protocol. It is clear that it is for the High Contracting Parties to decide whether and when tosign and ratify the latter. When it comes into force it will be for the Court to apply it.Finally, by way of an introductory note, we are aware that it may be tempting, when reflecting on theeffects of Protocol No.16, to compare it with the preliminary reference procedure which is the CJEU’smain judicial engine. However, it is important, in this context, to bear in mind the conclusion reached bythe Group ofWise Persons in its 2006 Report.Working under the chairmanship ofMr Gil Carlos RodríguezIglesias, previously President of the CJEU, the Report noted that:“In this connection, the introduction of a preliminary ruling mechanism on the model of that existingin the European Union was discussed. However, the Group reached the conclusion that the EU systemis unsuitable for transposition to the Council of Europe. The preliminary ruling mechanism representsan alternative model to the judicial control established by the Convention, which requires domesticremedies to be exhausted. The combination of the two systems would create significant legal andpractical problems and would considerably increase the Court’s workload.”4So while the two procedures may bear some similarities, and there is no doubt that the procedural andjudicial lessons learned with reference to the established Luxembourg procedure may be useful whendeveloping the Strasbourg one, the two procedures are by no means identical, nor were they intended tobe. Cross references to the Luxembourg procedure should not be interpreted as an indication to the contrary.II. HistoryBefore considering the detail of the substantive provisions of the Protocol, it may help to take a brief lookat the origins and the major steps in the history of the idea of empowering the Court to give advisoryopinions at the request of national courts.The aforementioned Report of the Group ofWise Persons to the Committee ofMinisters first suggestedthat:“… it would be useful to introduce a system under which the national courts could apply to the Courtfor advisory opinions on legal questions relating to interpretation of the Convention and the Protocolsthereto. This is an innovation which would foster dialogue between courts and enhance the Court’s‘constitutional’ role.”5That 2006 Report went on to suggest at paras 84–86 that:“84. … to enhance the judicial authority of this type of advisory opinion, all the States Parties tothe Convention should have the opportunity to submit observations to the Court on the legalissues on which an opinion is requested.3Note that preliminary draft amendments to the Rules of Court were submitted to Governments and interested NGOs in 2015, inviting them tocomment by the end of November 2015. Comments were received by two governments and from certain NGOs in a collective response.4Report of the Group of Wise Persons to the Committee of Ministers, Document CM(2006)203, https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805d7893 [Accessed 25 May 2018], para.80.5Report of the Group of Wise Persons to the Committee of Ministers, para.81.Some Reflections on Protocol No.16 221[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors85. The Group is aware of the repercussions which the proliferation of requests for opinionsmight have on the Court’s workload and resources, since the requests for opinions and themember states’ observations would also need to be translated. In addition, providing suchopinions would not be the Court’s principal judicial function. Accordingly, the Court’s newadvisory jurisdiction should be subject to strict conditions.86. It is proposed in this connection that:only constitutional courts or courts of last instance should be able to submit a requestfor an opinion;a)b) the opinions requested should only concern questions of principle or of generalinterest relating to the interpretation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto;c) the Court should have discretion to refuse to answer a request for an opinion. Forexample, the Court might consider that it should not give an answer in view of thestate of its case-law or because the subject-matter of the request overlaps with thatof a pending case. It would not have to give reasons for its refusal.”The next step appears to have been a joint proposal by the Dutch and Norwegian experts in January2009 to extend the Court’s jurisdiction to give advisory opinions6:“a. A request for an advisory opinion could only be made in cases revealing a potential systemicor structural problem.b. A request could only be made by a national court against whose decision there is no judicialremedy under national law.c. It should always be optional for the national court to make a request.d. The Court should enjoy full discretion to refuse to deal with a request, without giving reasons.e. All States Parties to the Convention should have the opportunity to submit written submissionsto the Court on the relevant legal issues.f. Requests should be given priority by the Court.g. An advisory opinion should not be binding for the State Party whose national court hasrequested it.h. The fact of the Court having given an advisory opinion on a matter should not in any wayrestrict the right of an individual to bring the same question before the Court under Art. 34of the Convention.i. Extension of the Court’s jurisdiction in this respect would be based in the Convention.”In February 2012, in preparation for the Brighton Conference in April that year, the Court issued aReflection Paper on the proposal to extend its jurisdiction to provide such advisory opinions.7The Brighton Declaration of 20 April 2012 stated that:“… the interaction between the Court and national authorities could be strengthened by the introductioninto the Convention of a further power of the Court, which States Parties could optionally accept, todeliver advisory opinions upon request on the interpretation of the Convention in the context of aspecific case at domestic level, without prejudice to the non-binding character of the opinions forthe other States Parties; invites the Committee of Ministers to draft the text of an optional Protocolto the Convention with this effect by the end of 2013; and further invites the Committee of Ministersthereafter to decide whether to adopt it.”86 Summarised in document CDDH(2012)R74 Addendum I, Appendix V, http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/cddh/Meeting%20reports%20committee/74_Final_Report_en.pdf [Accessed 25 May 2018].7 See http://echr.coe.int/Documents/Courts_advisory_jurisdiction_ENG.pdf [Accessed 25 May 2018].8 Paragraph 12(d) of the Brighton Declaration, https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016805caa07 [Accessed 25 May 2018].222 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe proceedings of the Brighton Conference record the head of the Dutch delegation as stating that:“We are particularly pleased to see a reference to an optional Protocol on advisory opinions. Webelieve this will strengthen the dialogue between the Court and domestic legal orders and reinforcethe principle of subsidiarity. By introducing advisory opinions, we aim to alleviate the Court’s workload in the long term.”9The drafting of the Protocol having been completed, on 6 May 2013 the Court adopted its “Opinionof the Court on Draft Protocol No. 16 to the Convention extending its competence to give advisory opinionson the interpretation of the Convention”10 and Protocol No.16 was opened for signature on 2 October2013.III. Aims and objectives of the advisory opinion procedureThe extension of the Court’s advisory jurisdiction is, according to the preamble of Protocol No.16, toenhance the interaction between the Court and national authorities with a view to reinforcing theimplementation of the ECHR in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.11 As can be seen from itshistory and origins, the advisory opinion procedure, when it enters into force, is intended to be a further,concrete manifestation of that principle.Subsidiarity is of course a two-sided principle. The Court’s supervisory role is subsidiary because itis the primary responsibility of theMember States to protect human rights within their jurisdiction. Advisoryopinions are thus intended to provide assistance toMember States so as to avoid future violations, facilitatethe correct interpretation of the Convention within national legal orders and, in this context, enhancejudicial dialogue. In the process, it is hoped advisory opinions might alleviate the Court which, despite aremarkable decrease in its stock of cases in recent years due to the introduction of new procedures andworking methods,12 is confronted by an untenable number of individual applications and decreasingfinancial resources to deal with them.The aim of the procedure is not to transfer the national dispute to the Court, but rather to give therequesting court or tribunal guidance on Convention issues when it subsequently determines the casebefore it. This is reflected in the procedural requirements discussed further below. Presumably, it is thoughtthat if superior courts follow the advisory opinion of the Court, the interpretation of the Conventionprovided by the latter will gain more traction within the domestic legal system as lower courts will bebound (whether as a matter of fact or law) to follow the lead of their superior courts.IV. Key parameters of the advisory opinion procedureArticles 1 and 5 of the Protocol establish what the key parameters or characteristics of the procedure willbe.1. Which courts can request an advisory opinion?Advisory opinions can be requested by the “highest courts or tribunals … as specified by [the HighContracting Party] under Article 10”.139 See http://www.coe.int/t/DGHL/STANDARDSETTING/CDDH/REFORMECHR/Publications/Brightonproceedings.pdf [Accessed 25 May 2018].10 See http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/2013_Protocol_16_Court_Opinion_ENG.pdf [Accessed 25 May 2018].11Note that, with Protocol No.16 entering into force before Protocol No.15, this would mean that the first explicit reference to subsidiarity in theECHR will derive from the former and not the latter and be the consequence of ratification by a reduced number of Contracting States.12Numbers (rounded up) of cases allocated to a judicial formation of the ECHR: 150,000 in 2011; 65,000 in 2015; 80,000 in 2016; and 57,000 asof 28 February 2018.13 See art.1(1) of Protocol No.16. According to art.10(2) of the Protocol, the declaration designating courts or tribunals for the purposes of art.1(1)may be modified by the High Contracting Party at any later date.Some Reflections on Protocol No.16 223[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsUse of the term “highest”, as opposed to “the highest”, as well as enabling/requiring High ContractingParties to specify the domestic courts who may request an advisory opinion from the Court suggest a moregenerous approach than initially envisaged (whereby limiting such a right to “national courts againstwhose decision there is no judicial remedy under national law” had been envisaged). The intention appearsto have been to permit the inclusion of those courts or tribunals that, although inferior to the constitutionalor supreme court, are nevertheless of especial relevance on account of being the “highest” for a particularcategory of case. The idea was also to allow the necessary flexibility to accommodate the particularitiesof 47 different national judicial systems.By restricting the courts which can request advisory opinions, the intention is not only to reflect theexhaustion of domestic remedies rule but also to avoid a proliferation of requests and to identify theappropriate level at which the intended judicial dialogue should take place. As the declarations lodgedthus far reveal, High Contracting Parties vary considerably in their approach. Finland, for example, hasdeclared that the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court, the Labour Court and the InsuranceCourt may all request advisory opinions.14 In contrast, Estonia and the Ukraine have declared that onlytheir Supreme Courts may request advisory opinions,15 while Romania, which has signed but not ratifiedthe Protocol, has designated 15 courts of appeal, the High Court of Cassation and Justice and theConstitutional Court.2. Optional nature of the advisory opinion procedure—request and withdrawalRelevant courts or tribunals may request the Court to give an advisory opinion.16Several interesting questions may develop despite the optional nature of the procedure. Could, forexample, the highest court with jurisdiction to refer a request be obliged to reason any refusal to do so ifone of the parties to the domestic proceedings had explicitly urged the national court to request an advisoryopinion? An analogy which could be drawn is with the Court’s art.6 case-law requiring national courtswhose decisions were not open to appeal under domestic law to give reasons, based on the applicable law,and the exceptions laid down in CJEU case-law, for their refusal to refer a preliminary question on theinterpretation of EU law.17 However, there are of course important distinctions—not least the obligatorynature of the EU preliminary reference procedure for courts of last resort (subject to certain well-definedexceptions) or the importance of the preliminary reference procedure in the context of the presumptionof equivalence which the Strasbourg Court operates in relation to the protection of fundamental rights inthe EU.18The advisory opinion procedure is not only optional but the requesting court may, according to theExplanatory Report, withdraw its request. Rule B(2.3) of the Rules of Court provides that it must notifythe Registrar in the event of withdrawal, upon receipt of which the Court shall discontinue the proceedings.14Declaration contained in the instrument of ratification deposited on 7 December 2015.15Declarations contained in the instrument of ratification deposited on 31 August 2017 (Estonia) and 22 March 2018 (Ukraine) respectively.16 See art.1(1) of Protocol No.16 and Rule B(1) of the Rules of Court. This is the first and major difference to be noted with the EU preliminaryreference procedure. See, in particular, the judgment inCilfit (283/81) [1982] E.C.R. I-03415 at [21]: “In accordance with the third paragraph of Article267 TFEU, a court or tribunal against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law is required, where a question of EU law is raisedbefore it, to comply with its obligation to bring the matter before the Court of Justice, unless it has established that the question raised is irrelevant orthat the provision of EU law in question has already been interpreted by the Court or that the correct application of EU law is so obvious as to leaveno scope for any reasonable doubt”. In addition, preliminary references on the validity of EU legislation must be referred: “courts may consider thevalidity of a Community act and, if they consider that the grounds put forward before them by the parties in support of invalidity are unfounded, theymay reject them, concluding that the measure is completely valid. … On the other hand, those courts do not have the power to declare acts of theCommunity institutions invalid. … where the validity of a Community act is challenged before a national court the power to declare the act invalidmust also be reserved to the Court of Justice” (Foto Frost (314/85), 22 October 1987 at [14], [15] and [17]). On withdrawal of a preliminary reference,see below for a temporal restriction.17 See, variously, Ullens de Schooten and Rezabek v Belgium (App. Nos 3989/07 and 38353/07), judgment of 20 September 2011; Dhahbi v Italy(App. No.17120/09), judgment of 8 April 2014; Schipani v Italy (App. No.38369/09), judgment of 21 July 2015 and Baydar v the Netherlands (App.No. 55385/14), judgment of 24 April 2018.18 See, in particular, Bosphorus Hava Yollari Turizm ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi v Ireland (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 1 at [160]-[165];Michaud v France(2014) 59 E.H.R.R. 9 at [112]-[115]; and Avotiņš v Latvia (2017) 64 E.H.R.R. 2 at [110].224 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThere is no indication whether a request must be withdrawn within a specific time-limit. For example,if the Court has set a date for the pronouncement of an advisory opinion could a requesting national courtwithdraw its request at that late stage?19 One approach would be, by analogy with contentious proceedingsbefore the Court, that withdrawal should be possible at any stage until pronouncement by the GrandChamber. Time alone will tell if a restriction on the entitlement to withdraw after a certain time-limitbecomes necessary.Withdrawal also raises issues regarding notification of the discontinuance of the advisory procedureby the Court under Rule B(2.3). Should the Court be responsible for notifying the Member State fromwhich the request originated, the parties, the third party interveners etc.? Will a specific type of order oract, announcing a strike out or discontinuance be required? If so, its form and language will have to beworked out. These may seem mundane questions but considering the Court’s docket and increasinglylimited resources they may be of some considerable administrative relevance depending on the judicial“traffic” which the new Protocol generates.3. What type of questions fall within the scope of the advisory opinion procedure?As indicated previously, pursuant to art.1(1), advisory opinions may be requested on “questions of principlerelating to the interpretation or application of the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention or theProtocols thereto”. The language of the latter provision reflects that of art.43(2) of the ECHR on referralto the Grand Chamber although the two procedures are, of course, very different.The definition of what comes within the scope of the advisory opinion procedure will be a matter forthe Court, and in particular the Panel established under art.2(1) of the Protocol, when deciding whetherto accept a request for an advisory opinion. It is to be expected that a line of case-law will develop—onthe basis of the Panel’s reasons for refusal of such requests—on criteria for determining what questionsfall within and outwith the scope of Protocol No.16. This is certainly what has occurred at the level of theCJEU, where there is extensive case-law both on questions of the limits to the jurisdiction of the CJEUand the admissibility of requests for preliminary references.20 It should be noted, however, that the Courtitself envisaged in 2013 that “such reasons [for refusal] will normally [not] be … extensive”.21The development of such case-law may also be of subsequent interest for those applying to the GrandChamber referral panel under art.43(2) and for the work of the referral panel itself. As the latter does notgive reasons when it accepts or refuses a referral request,22 there is no established case-law on whatconstitutes, within the meaning of art.43(2), “a serious question affecting the interpretation or applicationof the Convention or Protocols thereto, or a serious issue of general importance”. Guidance on this issuehas so far had to be deduced from the type of cases accepted by the panel for referral (insofar as possible)and from the Explanatory Report on Protocol No.11, which refers to important questions on theinterpretation and application of the ECHR, to cases where there may be a reason to revise well-establishedcase-law and to cases raising an important matter of general interest.19The Rules of Procedure of the CJEUwere amended in 2012 to avoid this possibility—see art.100(1): “The withdrawal of a request [for a preliminaryruling] may be taken into account until notice of the date of delivery of the judgment has been served on the interested persons”.20See the digest of relevant CJEU case-law (in French), accessible at https://curia.europa.eu/common/recdoc/repertoire_jurisp/bull_3/tab_index_3_04.htm [Accessed 25 May 2018].21European Court of Human Rights, Opinion of the Court on Draft Protocol No.16 to the Convention extending its competence to give advisoryopinions on the interpretation of the Convention, Strasbourg, 6 May 2013, para.9, http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/2013_Protocol_16_Court_Opinion_ENG.pdf [Accessed 25 May 2018].22 See para.105 of the Explanatory Report to Protocol No.11.Some Reflections on Protocol No.16 225[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors4. When can an advisory opinion be requested?An advisory opinion can only be made in the context of a case pending before the requesting court ortribunal.23 The procedure is not intended to allow for abstract review of legislation.The question arises whether, again drawing from the TFEU preliminary reference procedure, theStrasbourg Court will have to develop case-law to “police” this requirement. In the context of a proceduredesigned to enhance judicial dialogue and based, implicitly, on a principle of loyal cooperation, albeit nota formally established principle, a high degree of confidence will have to be accorded to the requestingcourt. However, even the existence of a recognised principle of loyal cooperation under EU law has notprevented the Luxembourg Court on some, albeit rare, occasions from refusing to provide a preliminaryruling in circumstances where it considered the pending case to be fictitious or where a dispute was notreally pending.24 In addition, since the 1990s, that court has developed an extensive line of case-lawexamining whether the admissibility requirements in art.267 of the TFEU, the Statute and the Rules ofProcedure have been fulfilled. In short, just as the CJEU has insisted on its right and its duty to controlthe limits of its own jurisdiction, once Protocol No.16 is in force, the Strasbourg Court will need toconsider—no doubt over time and informed by practical experience—whether and how far it needs to“police” compliance with this requirement and how far it can rely on a (if not express) at least implicitequivalent principle of loyal cooperation.On the exclusion of requests involving abstract review of legislation from the scope of Protocol No.16,the debate in France in the context of preparation for ratification of the Protocol may be of some interest.The draft law authorising ratification of the Protocol was put before the Assemblée nationale on 20December 2017. It designates the Conseil d’État, the Cour de Cassation and the Conseil Constitutionnelas the three highest courts which can seise the Strasbourg Court by virtue of Protocol No.16. The designationof this latter court, whose task is to control the conformity of legislation with the French constitution hasgiven rise to questions relating to whether a request for an advisory opinion by theConseil Constitutionnelwould comply with the criterion established by the Protocol requiring a request for guidance in a concretecase, excluding abstract review.25 The answer to this question is no doubt to be found in domestic law.However, the debate reveals the extent to which views on which domestic courts should be able to referis likely to vary considerably from one state to the next.5. The nature and jurisprudential effects of an advisory opinionAs is clear from art.5 of the Protocol, advisory opinions are not binding.In the context of the judicial dialogue in which they are handed down, it is the requesting court whichdecides on the effects of the advisory opinion in the domestic proceedings pending before it.23Article 1(2) of Protocol No.16.24 See, e.g. Foglia v Novello (244/80) [1980] E.C.R. 745 at [18]-[20]: “the duty assigned to the Court by Article [267] is not that of deliveringadvisory opinions on general or hypothetical questions but of assisting in the administration of justice in the Member States. It accordingly does nothave jurisdiction to reply to questions of interpretation which are submitted to it within the framework of procedural devices arranged by the partiesin order to induce the Court to give its views on certain problems of [EU] law which do not correspond to an objective requirement inherent in theresolution of a dispute. … Whilst the spirit of cooperation which must govern the performance of the duties assigned by Article [267] to the nationalcourts on the one hand and the Court of Justice on the other requires the latter to have regard to the national court’s proper responsibilities, it impliesat the same time that the national court, in the use which it makes of the facilities provided by Article [267], should have regard to the proper functionof the Court of Justice in this field”. See also the judgment of the ICJ in The Case concerning the Northern Cameroons (Cameroon v United Kingdom)(Preliminary Objections) judgment [1963] ICJ Reports 15, 37 where the Court indicated that “… even if, when seised of an Application, the Courtfinds that it has jurisdiction, it is not obliged to exercise it in all cases. If the Court is satisfied, … that to adjudicate on the merits of an Applicationwould be inconsistent with its judicial function, it should refuse to do so”. For a recent expression of the EU principle of sincere cooperation seeAssociação Sindical dos Juízes Portugueses v Tribunal de Contas (C-64/16), 27 February 2018.25 See, e.g. P. Cassia, “Le Conseil Constitutionnel et la procédure d’avis devant la Cour de Strasbourg”, 9 January 2018, https://blogs.mediapart.fr/paul-cassia/blog/080118/le-conseil-constitutionnel-et-la-procedure-d-avis-devant-la-cour-de-strasbourg [Accessed 25 May 2018]. For discussion ina recent Strasbourg case of the type of review exercised by the Conseil Constitutionnel see Charron and Merle Montet v France (App. No.22612/15),decision of 16 January 2018 at [26]–[29].226 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsIn addition, the handing down of an advisory opinion would not prevent a party to the case subsequentlyexercising their right of individual application under art.34 of the ECHR. Where an application is madesubsequent to proceedings in which an advisory opinion of the Court has effectively been followed, itcould be expected that such elements of the application that relate to the issues addressed in the advisoryopinion would be declared inadmissible or struck out. It is also possible, however, that the approach theCourt would take with regard to such an application may be different, since the individual application islikely to address the challenged national interpretation of the Court’s advisory opinion rather than theCourt’s interpretation of the Convention as such. This question remains open of course for the time being.However, and here we signal quite personal views, the introduction of the advisory opinion procedurepresents the Court with both tremendous opportunities and tremendous challenges.On the one hand, it has the possibility, given the more “constitutional” nature of the new procedure,26to express, clarify or develop general principles in a context broader than the individual facts of an individualcase may permit. The art.34 individual applications vehicle is subject to the risk—in certain cases, incertain circumstances and with reference to certain Convention questions—of obfuscating those generalprinciples given the degree to which the relevant judicial formation concentrates on their application inthe circumstances of a concrete case.27The challenges posed by Protocol No.16 will, in our view, be many, but two in particular are worthhighlighting.(a) The Court will first hand down an advisory opinion setting out the general principles to beapplied as regards the interpretation and application of the ECHR but, in any subsequentindividual application following the conclusion of the same case at national level, it willhave to remain coherent and consistent both in terms of the expression of those sameprinciples and their application to the facts of the case. A good example of the difficultieswhich may arise is provided in the Schatschaschwili v Germany case on the inability toexamine absent witnesses, whose testimonies carried considerable weight in the applicant’sconviction. As is clear from the joint dissenting opinion, the minority judges who were infavour of finding no violation agreed, however, with the majority as regards the generalprinciples the judgment established. They only parted company with the majority as regardsthe application of the relevant principles to that case.28 One is also reminded in this contextof the formula oft-used by the Court, in particular, in art.10 cases, where it states that “theCourt would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of the domestic courts”.29It remains to be seen whether this will also be the preferred approach in such doubleadjudication situations, either in relation to certain Convention articles or across the board.(b) The second challenge goes to the legitimacy and standing of the Court in the eyes of itsnational interlocutors. If national superior courts consistently or regularly decide not tofollow the terms of an advisory opinion, the resulting problems are obvious.As regards the jurisprudential value of advisory opinions, they will form part of the case-law of theCourt, alongside its judgments and decisions. The interpretation of the Convention contained in suchadvisory opinions would, one imagines, be analogous in its effect to the interpretative elements set outby the Court, sitting in a Grand Chamber formation, in judgments and decisions. This would mean,however, that even if an advisory opinion does not bind the requesting national Court when resolving the26References to the Court’s so-called “constitutional” role are absent from most official documents relating to Protocol No.16. See, however, thereference to such a role in the 2006 report of the Group of Wise Men where the origins of the proposal leading to Protocol No.16 can be traced.27 See, in this regard, the comments by our colleague, Judge Koskelo in XXVI FIDE conference, Copenhagen, 2014, p.152.28Schatschaschwili v Germany (App. No.9154/10), judgment of 15 December 2015; see alsoMerabishvili v Georgia (App. No.72508/13), judgmentof 28 November 2017.29 See, e.g. Von Hannover v Germany (No.2) (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 15.Some Reflections on Protocol No.16 227[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorscase before it, the interpretation of the Convention provision(s) provided by the Court is nevertheless anauthoritative one. In addition, even for those Member States which decide not to ratify Protocol No.16,it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that any opinions handed down on that basis will carry equal weightin cases involving individual applications against them.30An alternative view, if other Member States are not or do not involve themselves in the procedure,would be that the resulting advisory opinion is addressed only to the requesting court. However, MemberStates (and the public in general) are already alerted via the Court’s Hudoc database of all communicatedcases. A decision not to intervene when informed of a pending advisory opinion procedure should notdetract from the generality of the guidance provided by the Court. Both the formation chosen to provideadvisory opinions and the nature of the questions which can be the subject of requests suggest that limitingthe value of the opinion handed down to the requesting court only is to misconstrue the nature and intentof the Protocol and the procedure it provides for.Given that they are decided by the Court sitting in Grand Chamber formation, the question will inevitablyarise whether advisory opinions should not equally be given higher precedential value than judgments ofchambers and committees, despite their non-binding nature for the national requesting court.31V. Procedural issues1. The content of a request for an advisory opinionThe procedural requirements which a request for an advisory opinion must fulfil are set out in art.3(1) ofProtocol No.16 which provides that the requesting court or tribunal shall give reasons for its request andshall provide the relevant legal and factual background of the pending case.As the Explanatory Report highlights, these requirements serve two purposes:• the requesting court or tribunal must have reflected upon the necessity and utility of solicitingan advisory opinion of the Court, so as to be able to explain its reasons for doing so.• the requesting court or tribunal must be in a position to set out the relevant legal and factualbackground, thereby allowing the Court to focus on the question(s) of principle relating tothe interpretation or application of the Convention or the Protocols thereto. In its Opinionon the draft Protocol the Court stressed:“… the need to allow the Court to focus on the question of principle before it. TheCourt should not be called upon to review the facts or the national law in the contextof this procedure.”32As regards the legal and factual background, according to Rule B(2.1) of the Rules of Court, the requestfor an advisory opinion should include33:• the subject matter of the domestic case and its relevant factual and legal background34;• the relevant domestic legal provisions;30Especially as art.46(1) of the Convention, by definition, does not apply to advisory opinions under Protocol No.16. See below under Hearingsand Interventions on the right of other States Parties to intervene.31A related issue is how to cite advisory opinions so that they can be easily distinguished from individual and interstate applications.32Opinion adopted by the Plenary Court on 6 May 2013.33The detail derives not from the Protocol itself but from the amended Rules of Court and, previously, from the Explanatory Report to ProtocolNo.16 to the ECHR, CM(2013)31, 2 April 2013. The similarity between this list and that in art.94 of the CJEU’s Rules of Procedure which detailswhat a request for a preliminary ruling must contain, are striking. The amended Rules of Court reproduce the detail in the Explanatory Report; detailwhich is given further flesh in the Guidelines discussed below.34The wording of the relevant part of the Explanatory Report and Rule B(2.1)(a) differs. Rule B(2.2) specifies that the requesting court or tribunalshall also “submit any further documents of relevance to the legal and factual background of the pending case”.228 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors• the relevant Convention issues, in particular the rights or freedoms at stake;• if relevant, a summary of the arguments of the parties to the domestic proceedings on thequestion;• if possible and appropriate, a statement of the requesting court or tribunal’s own views onthe question, including any analysis it may itself have made of the question.The overarching aimmust be that the requesting court or tribunal places the Court in the most informedposition possible in order to enable it to respond meaningfully to the concerns expressed and questionsraised by the requesting court or tribunal as regards the application of Convention law to the domesticproceedings.Further, the Guidelines approved by the Plenary Court in September 2017 reiterate that in order forthe Court to be in a position to provide clear interpretative guidance to the requesting court or tribunal, arequest should be set out as prescribed in the Protocol and Rules of Court and should be complete andprecise.The Explanatory Report to the Protocol does not address the extent, if any, to which the parties to theprocedure can or should be involved in the initiative to request an advisory opinion or in the formulationof any request. The Guidelines note that the requesting court or tribunal has a degree of discretion todetermine whether it is “relevant” to include a summary of the arguments of the parties on the subject-matterof the request. To some extent this absence of detail mirrors the position in EU law but, as we know, theCJEU has developed case-law on the subject, emphasising that the right to request a preliminary rulingis not an individual right of the parties but rather is a right (and sometimes a duty) of the national court.35The extent to which parties are involved in the formulation of any request for an art.267 TFEU rulingvaries greatly between Member States. The Guidelines, however, do note that depending on the positionin domestic law, it may well be the case that one or both parties can take the initiative to ask the domesticcourt to make a request for an advisory opinion in their grounds of appeal against the decision of an inferiorcourt. Nonetheless, it is emphasised that in any event the final decision on whether or not to request anadvisory opinion rests with the appellate court or tribunal insofar as it has been designated as a court whichmay make such a request for the purposes of the Protocol.A further point of note is the recommendation that the requesting court include “where possible andappropriate” its views on the Convention question raised and any analysis it may have made in this regard.The NGOs consulted in 2015 expressed concern that this might lead to the outcome of the domesticproceedings being prejudged.36 Questions of national procedural law aside, we do not, personally, seewhere the problem lies. The views expressed are clearly not binding but they may be of tremendousassistance to the Court. It will be under pressure to provide an answer in an expedited procedure in ordernot to delay domestic proceedings.37 The Guidelines point out that what is important is that the requestingcourt or tribunal, in the exercise of its judgment, places the Court in the most informed position possiblein order to enable it to provide the interpretative guidance sought.Finally, while there was no indication in the Protocol or the Explanatory Report of any limit to thewritten comments or documents submitted, the Guidelines provide detailed practical instructions for thepresentation of a request. According to these Guidelines, the page limit, in principle, for a complete requestshould not exceed 20 pages. The economy and relevance of documents submitted in connection with arequest for an advisory opinion is plainly an important consideration given both linguistic and timeconstraints.35 See, e.g. judgment in T-Mobile Czech Republic v Vodafone Czech Republic (C-508/14), 6 October 2015 at [28]-[29]: “Under Article 267 TFEU,it is for the national court, not the parties to the main proceedings, to bring a matter before the Court of Justice. The right to determine the questionsto be put to the Court thus devolves on the national court alone and the parties may not change their tenor”.36 See the legal briefing of the Open Society, March 2016, reference provided below.37 See, similarly, para.24 of the CJEU’s non-binding Recommendations to national courts and tribunals in relation to the initiation of preliminaryruling proceedings [2012] OJ C 338/01, remembering that a preliminary ruling is, moreover, binding.Some Reflections on Protocol No.16 229[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors2. Procedure for deciding on the acceptance or rejection of a requestThis procedure is set out in art.2(1) of Protocol No.16 which makes clear that the Court has discretionregarding whether to accept or refuse a request but that the latter must be reasoned.38 This contrasts withthe referral procedure where the five-judge referral panel, as indicated previously, does not reason therefusal of a referral request. Once again, this difference could be regarded as entirely in accordance withthe nature of the judicial dialogue which the advisory opinion procedure seeks to enhance. Nevertheless,it is worth emphasising that both the original Group of Wise Persons Report 2006 and the Court in itsown 2012 Reflection Paper proposed no obligation to reason in order to preserve the Court’s flexibilityand limit the additional workload which processing requests for advisory opinions might entail.It should not be presumed that the referral and the advisory opinion panels would be the same oridentical in their composition. After all, art.2(3) of the Protocol requires that the panel “shall include exofficio the judge elected in respect of the High Contracting Party to which the requesting court or tribunalpertains”; a requirement that does not apply to the referral panel, the composition of which is governedby Rule 24(5) of the Rules of Court. In fact, Rule 24(5)(c) expressly provides that “No judge elected inrespect of, or who is a national of, a Contracting Party concerned by a referral request may be a memberof the panel when it examines that request”. The composition of the five-judge advisory opinion panel isgoverned by Rule C of the new Chapter X to the Rules of Court. It will consist of the President of theCourt, two Section Presidents, the judge elected in respect of the Contracting Party to which the requestingcourt or tribunal pertains and a judge designated by rotation from among the other Section judges servingon the panel for a six-month period.The amended Rules of Court provide in Rule 3(2) that requests for advisory opinions shall be processedas a matter of priority in accordance with Rule 41 of the Rules of Court. However, there is no formaltime-limit expressed, either in the Guidelines or in binding form, within which the Court should adopt adecision to refuse a request for an advisory opinion.As indicated previously, it can be expected that the advisory opinion panel will, over time, clarify whatis meant by “questions of principle relating to the interpretation or application of the rights and freedomsdefined in the Convention or the Protocols thereto”.We express a note of caution, again a personal one, in relation to the need for the panel to clearly reasonin terms of jurisdiction or admissibility.39A close reading of the case-law of the CJEU under art.267 TFEUreveals that these issues are sometimes treated as synonymous and sometimes not.40 In general, the CJEUhas refused to provide preliminary rulings where the domestic case is hypothetical, where the questionreferred bears no relation to the facts and subject-matter of the case before the national court, where thefacts or legal framework are insufficiently clear (even though the Court can also make further inquiriesof the national referring court in both regards) or where the questions do not involve an interpretation ofEU law.41The terms of decisions to refuse a request will and should provide guidance to domestic courts andtribunals when consideringwhether tomake a request andwill and should thereby help to deter inappropriaterequests which will consume precious Court resources.In this context, it is necessary to insert a further note of caution (a personal obiter no doubt) in relationto the statement in the Explanatory Report to the effect that:38 See also Rule C(4).39Already one can see some potential “false friends” in the Protocol and the Explanatory Report, where the former refers in the preamble to anextension of the Court’s “competence”, while the latter talks about an extension of its “jurisdiction”.40 See, e.g. the treatment of jurisdiction and admissibility questions in Pohotovost (C-470/12), 27 February 2014 at [58]-[61]; Szabó (C-204/14), 4September 2014 at [18]-[25]; Crono Service (C-419/12 and C-420/12), 13 February 2014 at [43]-[44] or Vinkov (C-27/11), 7 June 2012 at [44]-[45].41This case-law is accessible via the CJEU digest of case-law at https://curia.europa.eu/common/recdoc/repertoire_jurisp/bull_3/tab_index_3_04.htm [Accessed 25 May 2018].230 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors“It is to be expected that the Court would hesitate to refuse a request that satisfies the relevant criteriaby (i) relating to a question as defined in paragraph 1 of Article 1 and (ii) the requesting court ortribunal having fulfilled the procedural requirements as set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 1.”42After all, this statement describes an untested procedure which will require the Court to extend itsjurisdiction to a perhaps very different judicial exercise than those which it currently performs under art.34and without any prior knowledge of how many states will consent to the Protocol or the frequency,complexity and clarity of their requests if and when they do.43 The Court’s initial Reflection Paper onadvisory opinions spoke of cases whichmight not require further clarification or where Strasbourg case-lawis sufficiently clear, implicitly referring to something along the line of the CJEU’s acte clair doctrine. TheCourt will of course have to be deft when explaining to a national court which thinks the case-law isunclear why, in contrast, the Court considers it is. Another scenario envisaged by the Group of WisePersons Report 2006 was the rejection of a request where its subject-matter overlaps with that of a pendingcase. It will surely be possible for the Court to refuse a request even if the subject-matter falls within thescope of Protocol No.16 and basic procedural requirements are complied with. Certainly, the Group ofWise Persons Report 2006 referred to previously stated that the new advisory jurisdiction should be subjectto strict conditions and the provision of such opinions would not constitute the Court’s principal judicialfunction. By implicating the Grand Chamber in all requests deemed admissible, Protocol No.16 couldotherwise have not insignificant consequences for the workload of that judicial formation. It may require,in the short or medium term, adaptation of that formation’s working methods.3. The nature and form of an advisory opinionIt is the Grand Chamber of the Court that shall deliver advisory opinions following acceptance of a requestby the five-judge panel and reasons shall be given (art.2(2) and 4(1)).44This was considered appropriate given the nature of the questions on which an advisory opinion maybe requested and the fact that only the highest domestic courts or tribunals may request it, along with therecognised similarities between the present procedure and that of referral to the Grand Chamber underart.43 of the Convention. Time alone will tell whether this choice was wise. A specialised advisory opinionChamber might, alternatively, have allowed any subsequent individual application (alleging non- orincorrect application of any opinion) to be relinquished rapidly and where necessary to the Grand Chamber.While the draft Explanatory Report referred explicitly to the possibility of the Grand Chamberreformulating the questions in the request, the text as adopted does not expressly tackle this issue. Ifreformulation or reclassification of the advice sought were an option, which the Court’s case-law on thereclassification of complaints suggests it might be,45 then the Court’s advisory opinion might addressarticles of the Convention not the subject of the request in addition or even instead of those which are.Reformulation of questions is a well-established technique in Luxembourg preliminary references albeit,it should be added, not one always or universally welcomed by the national courts.4642 See para.14 of the Explanatory Report.43 Since the questions which can be the subject of an advisory opinion have some parallel with those which can be the subject of a referral request,it is worth reproducing the number of such requests accepted in recent years: 7 (2012), 10 (2013), 18 (2014), 15 (2015), 14 (2016) and 10 (2017).44There is no similar provision under the TFEU or the Rules of Procedure of the CJEU requiring references from superior courts or courts of lastresort to be dealt with by the Grand Chamber of that court. Member States or EU institutions can request, however, that a case be dealt with by theGrand Chamber (see art.60(1) of the ECJ’s Rules of Procedure).45 See, by analogy, the Court’s approach in contentious proceedings, where it has repeatedly indicated that “being master of the characterisation tobe given in law to the facts of the case (see Castravet v Moldova (App. No.23393/05), judgment of 13 March 2007 at [23];Marchenko v Ukraine (App.No.4063/04), judgment of 19 February 2009 at [34]; and Berhani v Albania (App. No.847/05), judgment of 27 May 2010 at [46]) [it] is not bound bythe characterisation given by the parties”: Gatt v Malta (App. No.28221/08), judgment of 27 July 2010 at [19].46 See, e.g. the CJEU judgments in Campina (C-45/06) [2007] E.C.R. I-02089 at [30] and [31], and Fuß (C-243/09) [2010] E.C.R. I-09849 at [39]:“[I]n the procedure laid down by Article 267 TFEU providing for cooperation between national courts and the Court of Justice, it is for the latter toprovide the national court with an answer which will be of use to it and enable it to determine the case before it. To that end, the Court may have toSome Reflections on Protocol No.16 231[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsIt remains to be seen to what extent the new procedure will entail significant additional work for theGrand Chamber and how easy it will be for that composition to reconcile its workload under arts 33 and34 of the Convention with this new advisory workload. It cannot be excluded that the new procedure willwarrant some changes to the Court’s internal working methods in Grand Chamber cases.As indicated previously, if a request is accepted, the composition of the Grand Chamber will bedetermined by Rule 24(2)(a), (b) and (e) of the Rules of Court. It shall include ex officio the judge electedin respect of the High Contracting Party to which the requesting court or tribunal pertains or, failing that,an ad hoc national judge.47Not only will advisory opinions be reasoned; they may be accompanied by separate concurring anddissenting opinions or a bare statement of dissent (art.4(1) and (2) and Rule D(8)). In its Opinion on thedraft Protocol the Court noted that:“This is in keeping with the Rules of Court on advisory opinions under the current system (Rule 88§ 2) although it has been the practice of the Court when issuing advisory opinions to endeavour tospeak with one voice.”48This leads to the inevitable question, raised we understand in the context of the Dutch Senateconsideration of draft ratifying legislation, whether and how an opinion of the Grand Chamber in suchproceedings can be seen as a correct/authoritative ruling on the “question of principle” raised by therequesting court where, in the context of contentious proceedings, judgments of the Court regularly containdissenting opinions both in Chamber judgments as well as in Grand Chamber judgments.49 Personallyspeaking, we consider that if the advisory opinion is to fulfil the function for which it wasintended—enhancing judicial dialogue with national judges with a view to reinforcing implementation ofthe Convention—the Grand Chamber will be put to the collegiate test in future and must seek to minimisethe occasions on which, on questions of legal principle, it is highly divided.504. Priority treatmentThe Explanatory Report referred to the need to avoid “undue delay” without specifying what is meant byundue delay?Rule 3(2) of the Rules of Court sets out that requests for advisory opinions shall be processed as amatter of priority in accordance with Rule 41 thereof. Section XI of the Guidelines provides further detailon the priority to be accorded to requests, and makes provision for ‘urgent’ examination over and abovethe priority status normally to be accorded to all such requests.In such urgent cases, the Guidelines provide that the requesting court or tribunal should indicate, givingreasons, whether there are any special circumstances which would require an urgent examination of therequest and a speedy ruling by the Court. It will be for the Court to determine whether the reasons putforward by the requesting court or tribunal are such as to justify an expedited treatment of the request.The Court can also decide of its own motion to treat a request according to an expedited procedure.The Explanatory Report had made clear that priority status for requests for advisory opinions shouldapply at all stages of the procedure and to all concerned, namely the requesting court or tribunal, whichshould formulate the request in a way that is precise and complete, and those that may be submittingwritten comments or taking part in hearings,51 as well as the Court itself.reformulate the questions referred to it. The Court has a duty to interpret all provisions of EU law which national courts require in order to decide theactions pending before them, even if those provisions are not expressly indicated in the questions referred to the Court by those courts”.47Article 2(3) of the Protocol and Rule 24(2)(b).48 Paragraph 11 of the Opinion, cited above (emphasis added).49 See the deliberations of the Eerste Kamer on 5 September 2017.50A good case in point may be the Béláné Nagy v Hungary (App. No.53080/13), judgment of 13 December 2016.51 See also art.3, discussed below.232 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsFor cases terminated in 2015, the average time for a decision before the Grand Chamber followingreferral was 15.6 months and, following relinquishment, 17.5 months. For cases terminated in 2016, theaverage time was 17.1 following referral and 17.4 months following relinquishment. The speed of putthrough is clearly affected by the number of cases pending before that formation and entry into force ofthe Protocol may, as stated previously, increase the pressure.Looking to the Luxembourg court for some additional statistical guidance, the 2016 annual report ofthat Court reveals the following:• on average, it took 15 months to dispose of a preliminary reference;• as regards a subset of the art.267 TFEU procedure, the urgent preliminary ruling procedure,12 urgent preliminary rulings were requested in 2016 but the Court chose to apply theprocedure in eight cases. It took, on average, 2.7 months to dispose of these cases, up from2.1 in 2015.Although referring to a quite distinct court and judicial procedure, these statistics reveal that theStrasbourg Court is highly likely to be faced with decisions and challenges regarding what is meant by“no undue delay” and what, in practice, priority means. As the CJEU knows only too well, the time takento dispose of a preliminary reference—which at its peak in 2003 reached 25.5 months—at times influencedthe decision by certain national courts on whether to refer.If “undue delay” is interpreted to mean less than the present Grand Chamber average, this can beexpected to have a knock-on effect on the work of the Court generally and on the work of the GrandChamber in particular.5. Hearings and interventionsHearings are clearly not excluded but neither are they obligatory.52According to Rule D(6) of the amendedRules of Court, the President will decide on whether or not to hold a hearing at the close of the writtenprocedure.Most Grand Chamber cases (referrals and relinquishments) are organised with an oral procedure.53 Ifthe procedure is both written and oral the time taken for the advisory opinion to be communicated to therequesting court will of course be longer.The Member State from which the request originates may submit written comments or appear at anyhearing but is not obliged to do so. The President of the Court may also, pursuant to art.3 and in the interestof the proper administration of justice, invite any otherMember State or person to submit written commentsor take part in any hearing.As regards who can intervene and how they do so, a number of issues were initially relatively vagueand, even after the amendment of the Rules of Court and the development of Guidelines, some remain so.It was not initially clear whether the parties to the proceedings at the domestic level would be notifiedof a request and/or invited to intervene if that request is accepted or, in certain cases, in the initial processingof the request. The Explanatory Report indicates that this is expected but the text of the Protocol left thequestion open. Rule D(3) provides that the President of the Grand Chamber may invite these parties tosubmit written observations and, if appropriate, to take part in an oral hearing. It has been observed thatwere parties allowed to submit their memoranda automatically, the borderline between adversarial procedureand the advisory opinion procedure would become blurred.54 The Guidelines provide that with regard to52See the terms of art.3 of Protocol No.16. See also para.21 of the Explanatory Report which provides that it will be for the Court to decide whetherto hold a hearing on an accepted request.53 See Rules 63 and 71. Most Chamber cases are processed without a hearing.54 See K. Dzehtsiarou and N. O’Meara, “Advisory jurisdiction and the European Court of Human Rights: a magic bullet for dialogue anddocket-control?” (2014) Legal Studies 18.Some Reflections on Protocol No.16 233[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsnotification about progress in the proceedings, it is for the requesting court or tribunal to keep the partiesto the domestic proceedings informed, except in the event that one or both parties have been invited tointervene in the proceedings, in which case the Court shall assume this function.Will the Court and its President be as inclusive as they are now, in someGrand Chamber cases, regardingrequests for third party interventions under art.36(2) and Rule 44?55 The new Rule 44(7) will apply theprovisions on third-party intervention mutatis mutandis to the advisory opinion procedure.56 The samecriterion—acceptance in the interests of the proper administration of justice—applies. Careful considerationof this issue is required given the different nature of the advisory procedure, the fact that it is occurringin the context of a pending case between identified parties, the fact that it is not intended as a vehicle forabstract review of Member State legislation or policy and the time component highlighted above. It isuseful to refer again to the art.267 TFEU procedure, where intervention extends only to the parties to thedomestic proceedings, EU institutions (where appropriate),Member States and the European Commissionas a sort of amicus curiae.57 In Luxembourg, in cases before the Grand Chamber and even at chamberlevel, extensive use of this intervention is made by Member States depending on the legal and politicalimportance, and to some extent novelty, of the questions raised in the pending preliminary reference.58 Incontrast, to date, Member States have availed themselves sparingly of their opportunity to intervene inStrasbourg Grand Chamber cases.59 Given the proposed jurisprudential effects of future advisory opinionshanded down by the Grand Chamber, it is worth considering whether Contracting Parties, even if theyhave not ratified Protocol No.16, should not pay greater attention to the question of third party interventionsin future. In the run up to the 2018 Copenhagen conference on the future of the Court and the Conventionsystem, there was much discussion of the different form—judicial and political—which dialogue with theCourt should take. The Court, in its Opinion on the draft Copenhagen Declaration, stressed that in relationto the development of its case-law, the appropriate mechanisms for dialogue take the form of domesticcourt decisions and third-party interventions before the Court. It noted that the latter mechanism can berelevant to different stages in the examination of a case by the Court, including the admissibility stage,the stage of seeking referral of a case under art.43 of the Convention, and ultimately that of the GrandChamber’s consideration of the case. The Court stressed that, used well, interventions by third parties inproceedings are helpful for the Court, giving it the benefit of additional perspectives on the issues to bedecided in the case. It noted that this mechanism of engagement by states with the Court’s judicial functiondoes not appear to be used to its fullest potential and that, once Protocol No.16 has entered into force, thismechanism may become even more significant. We would underline the Court’s position in this regard.60While para.13 of the Explanatory Report expressly envisaged that the Court “would be able to receiverequests in languages other than English or French, as it does at present for individual applications”, nomention is made in either the Protocol itself or the Explanatory Report of the language of written55 See, variously, P. Harvey, “Third party interventions before the ECtHR: A rough guide” (24 February 2015) Strasbourg Observers, https://strasbourgobservers.com/2015/02/24/third-party-interventions-before-the-ecthr-a-rough-guide/ [Accessed 25May 2018];W.A.

In recent ground-breaking data protection cases, the number ofMemberState interventions was also very high—see, e.g. Digital Rights (C-293/12 and C-594/12), 8 April 2014 (eight Member States, European Parliamentand the European Commission) or Tele 2 Sverige (C-203/15 and C-698/15) judgment of 21 December 2016 (15 Member States, European Parliament,Council and Commission).59Out of a grand total of 19 judgments and one decision delivered by the Grand Chamber during the course of 2017, Member States intervened infive cases.60Opinion of the European Court of Human Rights on the draft Copenhagen Declaration, adopted by the Bureau in light of the discussion in thePlenary Court on 19 February 2018, https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Opinion_draft_Declaration_Copenhague%20ENG.pdf [Accessed 25 May2018], para.16; see now also paras 33–41 (“Interaction between the national and European level—the need for dialogue”) of the Copenhagen Declarationas adopted on 13 April 2018.234 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorssubmissions and interventions. Rule 44(6), which applies mutatis mutandis to third-party interventions inan advisory opinion procedure, requires them to be in an official language. Rule D(3) is silent on thelanguage of the submissions of any parties to the domestic proceedings.Finally, judicial dialogue, in order to be enhanced, also has to be nurtured—particularly when what isat issue is a new, untried procedure. Even when dealing with accepted requests, it cannot be excluded thatthe Court would wish to engage its judicial interlocutor further. The new Rule D(2) provides that after arequest is accepted, the President of the Grand Chamber may invite the requesting court or tribunal tosubmit any further information which is considered necessary for clarifying the scope of the request orits own views on the questions raised by the request. Similarly, the Guidelines will envisage the possibilityto seek supplementation of the request where it is considered to be “deficient”. The terms of Rule D(2)could be read as presupposing that the conditions for the admissibility of a request provided for in RuleB(2.1) are to be strictly applied and have been met. Guidelines aside, the strictness or flexibility in theapplication of the B(2.1) procedure will be closely watched by national courts one would imagine.Depending on the number of requests received, it may also determine the extent of the Court’s additionaladvisory workload.6. Language of requests and of advisory opinionsWhile the Court has only two official languages,61 requests for advisory opinions may be addressed to theCourt in the national official language used in the domestic proceedings in accordance with Rule 34(7).If the language used is not an official language of the Court, the Rules provide that an English or Frenchtranslation must be submitted within the time-limit fixed by the President of the Court.As regards the request itself, this means that the immediate access of most judges to the request, exceptwhere the language is a well-known one, may only be through the national judge and the registry lawyersuntil or unless a translation is available. On the one hand, one could argue that this is entirely in keepingwith the Court’s existing working methods—or rather the existing constraints under which it works—whendealing with individual applications. On the other, it could be argued that this method is ill-suited to aprocedure which has, as its purpose, the enhancement of judicial dialogue and where any delay will havea knock-on effect on the still pending domestic proceedings.The Explanatory Report emphasised the sensitivity of the language issue but only as regards the resultingadvisory opinions; not as regards the initial processing and subsequent treatment of requests by and withinthe Court. It provides that:“It is important to bear in mind that in most cases advisory opinions will have to be admitted toproceedings that take place in an official language of the High Contracting Party concerned that isneither English nor French, the Court’s official languages. Whilst respecting the fact that there areonly two official languages of the Court, it was considered important to underline the sensitivity ofthe issue of the language of advisory opinions. It should also be taken into account that the suspendeddomestic proceedings can in many legal systems be resumed only after the opinion is translated intothe language of the requesting court or tribunal. In the event of concerns that the time taken fortranslation into the language of the requesting court or tribunal of an advisory opinion may delay theresumption of suspended domestic proceedings, it may be possible for the Court to co-operate withnational authorities in the timely preparation of such translations.”6261Rule 34.62 See para.23 of the Explanatory Report.Some Reflections on Protocol No.16 235[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsIn the absence of increased budgetary resources, it is difficult to foresee how the issue of translationcan be tackled. The Court, in its Opinion on the draft Protocol, expressed grave concern on this issue bothin terms of workload and cost.63VI. Where do we go from here?As indicated previously, the Court has been working for some considerable time to prepare itself for theentry into force of Protocol No.16, now known to be on 1 August 2018. As part of this process, amendmentsto the Rules were adopted by the Plenary on 19 September 2016 and non-binding Guidelines were approvedby the Plenary on 18 September 2017. The operation of the latter will be kept under periodic review.The new procedure has been the subject of various but not extensive academic and judicial comment.64Legal academia is, understandably, more reactive than predictive when it comes to a new, untested judicialprocedure. The paucity of commentaries will no doubt change in due course.Particular concern relating to the Protocol has been expressed in some EU circles. In Opinion 2/13 onthe accession of the EU to the ECHR, the Court of Justice referred to Protocol No.16, noting that:“… since [after accession] the ECHR would form an integral part of EU law, the mechanismestablished by that protocol could—notably where the issue concerns rights guaranteed by the Chartercorresponding to those secured by the ECHR—affect the autonomy and effectiveness of the preliminaryruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU.In particular, it cannot be ruled out that a request for an advisory opinion made pursuant to ProtocolNo 16 by a court or tribunal of a Member State that has acceded to that protocol could trigger theprocedure for the prior involvement of the Court of Justice, thus creating a risk that the preliminaryruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU might be circumvented, a procedure which, …is the keystone of the judicial system established by the Treaties.”65Many commentators have criticised the CJEU’s own criticism of the failure in the draft accessionagreement to make any provision in respect of the relationship between the mechanism established byProtocol No.16 and the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU. On the one hand,when the CJEU was deliberating, the Protocol was not yet in force, nor was it forseeable when it wouldbe. On the other hand, commentators point out that misuse by national courts of Protocol No.16 in orderto circumvent the preliminary reference procedure and refer questions on substantive EU fundamentalrights law to the Strasbourg Court could be sanctioned in different ways, not least by the introduction ofinfringement proceedings. Furthermore, it should be recognised that in some cases the problem may notnecessarily be the decision to request a non-binding opinion from Strasbourg but the decision to refrainfrom seeking a binding one from Luxembourg. In Melki and Abdeli, the CJEU examined the prioritynature of an interlocutory procedure for the review of the constitutionality of a national law (known asthe question prioritaire de constitutionnalité or QPC in French law). The CJEU held in that case that:“…Article 267 TFEU precludesMember State legislationwhich establishes an interlocutory procedurefor the review of the constitutionality of national laws, in so far as the priority nature of that procedure63 See para.14 of the Opinion, cited above.64 See variously L.-A.

As the advisory opinionprocedure is both facultative in terms of its use and non-binding in terms of the resulting opinion, it isquestionable to what extent a Melki and Abdeli type instruction would be required to deter or preventnational courts of EU Member States from having recourse to the advisory opinion procedure underProtocol No.16. Given the terms of art.52, para.3 of the Charter and indeed the very reason for its existence,it is clear that some questions referred under the advisory opinion procedure may, indeed will, have indirectconsequences for the interpretation for the corresponding provisions of the Charter. As the President ofthe CJEU emphasised in his speech at the opening of the 2018 Strasbourg judicial year: “the CJEU takesaccount of the Convention as the minimum threshold for protection”, even if, of course, the EU systemof fundamental rights protection may go above and beyond that threshold. That does not mean, however,that the advisory opinion procedure, as such, should pose a problem for the autonomy and effectivenessof the EU judicial order or for the latter’s exclusive competence when it comes to the interpretation of EUlaw, including the Charter. Indeed, in Opinion 2/13, the CJEU stressed the mutually interdependent legalrelations linking the EU and its Member States and the fact that the EU’s legal structure:“is based on the fundamental premiss that eachMember State shares with all the otherMember States,and recognises that they share with it, a set of common values on which the EU is founded, as statedin Article 2 TEU. That premiss implies and justifies the existence of mutual trust between theMemberStates that those values will be recognised and, therefore, that the law of the EU that implementsthem will be respected.”67Given these essential characteristics of the EU legal order it is difficult therefore, from a Strasbourgperspective, to see why EU Member State courts would systematically or regularly have recourse to theECHR seeking answers to questions which, in reality, concern EU law. That being said, the advisoryopinion panel and the Grand Chamber when seised of a request, will have to adhere faithfully to the Court’swell-established case-law according to which, under the terms of art.19 and art.32(1) of the Convention,the Court is not competent to apply or examine alleged violations of EU rules unless and in so far as theymay have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention.68Suffice it, for our present purposes, to say that the CJEU’s foray into an examination of Protocol No.16in Opinion 2/13 underlines the interest and sensitivity which the Protocol, rightly or wrongly, may excitein some quarters, the need for the new procedure to be well explained and, when it comes into force, theneed for the Strasbourg Court to carefully delimit its jurisdiction when accepting/refusing requests andhanding down advisory opinions. Protocol No.16 was not intended as an invitation to forum shop butrather as ameans to enhance judicial dialogue regarding the interpretation and application of the Convention.66Melki and Abdeli (C-188/10 and C-189/10) [2010] E.C.R.

In one of thefeatured articles, Walter Russell Mead observes that: “it is, in many ways, a stressful and anxious time tobe alive. And that anxiety has prompted a pervasive sense of despair about American democracy—a fearthat it has reached a point of dysfunction and decay from which it will never recover”.3*Max Du Plessis, a practising barrister and Senior Counsel in South Africa, is an associate fellow at Chatham House, London and associate memberof Doughty Street Chambers, London and honorary research fellow at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.

We do so by briefly calling to mind the success of the political transition from theinhumane system of apartheid to democracy and the hope that the period from 1994 brought with it forthe country. We focus in particular on the Constitution forged at the dawn of South Africa’s democracy,and its principal features. We discuss the signs of democratic regression that have punctuated the last 10years and draw from the South African experience, particularly under the regime of President Zuma, tohighlight the pressures that were brought to bear on South Africa as a young democracy. We argue, withreference to certain representative cases, that it is because of constitutionally entrenched democraticprinciples and institutions and an active citizenry that South Africa has withstood the challenges faced byits democracy over the last decade. Finally, we emphasise that it is precisely at moments of threat todemocratic ideals, that it has proved (and remains) essential for South Africa to live up to the aspirationaldemands of its own Constitution, and to seek, together with other states, to meet challenges with a principledand courageous foreign policy, guided by human rights and the rule of law. At a time when the world isin need of leadership that is inclusive, mature and which confirms—rather than rejects—the values ofmultilateralism, accountability and strength by unity, South Africa stands poised to make a significantcontribution to international affairs. With the Zuma years behind us, there remains much to be redone andrebuilt with the benefit of lessons learnt. Eyes will be on our leadership for positive pointers about SouthAfrica’s future role on the global stage, not just being open to business and trade, but as a trusted partnerto other countries which want to build a more sustainable, fair and tolerant future—to tackle togetherissues like climate change, migration, trade, terrorism and international accountability, as obvious examplesof global issues that impact locally.Writing in 1993, Nelson Mandela emphasised that South Africa’s foreign relations would henceforthbe based on the belief that “human rights should be the core concern of international relations”.8 He madeclear that South Africa was “ready to play a role in fostering peace and prosperity in the world we sharewith the community of nations”. He committed South Africa to being at the “forefront of global effortsto promote and foster democratic systems of government” and emphasised that “accountable governmentis good government”.After the elections of 1994 that signalled a peaceful transition from oppression to democracy, the countryand indeed the world was thrown into a sense of euphoria over the potential South Africa had and thelessons to be extracted from her experience. “Rainbow nation” and “miracle nation” are phrases that werefrequently used to encapsulate the hope that South Africa brought to the world.4United Nations, International Migration Report, 2017, UN Doc.ST/ESA/SER.A/404.

It was simply the beginning. Thus, the Constitution was intended to bea transformative instrument, no mere entrencher of a status quo already achieved.10 As the interimConstitution noted in its epilogue, the Constitution was:“a historic bridge between the past of a deeply divided society characterised by strife, conflict, untoldsuffering and injustice, and a future founded on the recognition of human rights, democracy andpeaceful co-existence and development opportunities for all South Africans, irrespective of colour,race, class, belief or sex.”The Constitution set as its core values, and the leitmotif of its transformative agenda, human dignity,equality, freedom, constitutional supremacy, the rule of law and accountable democratic government.11Beyond extending the franchise and associated political and civil rights to all citizens, replacing thedoctrine of parliamentary sovereignty with the doctrine of constitutional supremacy and according allSouth Africans human rights, including socio-economic rights, enshrined in a justiciable Bill of Rights,the Constitution was intended to serve as the yardstick against which government could be held accountableby citizens.Thus, the Constitution was the fledgling democracy’s bulwark to ensure that, as Mandela passionatelyproclaimed at his inauguration, “never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will againexperience the oppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world”.12Despite all the euphoria of the transition to democracy, and in some respects because of it, theconstitutional project has been put to the test, and not only because the new ANC government that cameto power in 1994 under President Mandela had to deal with the legacy of centuries of racial discriminationand socio-economic exclusion under apartheid and colonialism before that. Particularly over the past 10years (under the administration of former President Zuma) South Africa has witnessed numerous concerningaffronts to its constitutional and democratic ideals, leading to anxiety, frustration and increased tensionsamongst South Africans. Under former President Zuma’s administration corruption, the poor managementof state resources and the systematic attempt to disable and dismantle independent state institutions(particularly in an attempt to ensure that Zuma and his cronies did not face accountability for corruption)had left many South Africans, and indeed international observers, feeling that the dream of the rainbownation was no longer achievable.139The interim Constitution came into force on 27 April 1994, and laid the foundation for the final Constitution which came into force in 1997.Uniquely, it was the newly established Constitutional Court that was required, before the final Constitution could be adopted, to certify that it compliedwith the principles set out in the interim Constitution. The first draft of the final Constitution did not pass muster. It was only the second draft whichreceived the Constitutional Court imprimatur, after amendments had been made in accordance with the Court’s First Certification Judgment. See ExParte Chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly: In re Certification of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 1996 (4) SA 744 (CC)(First Certification Judgment) and Ex parte Chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly: In re Certification of the Amended Text of the Constitutionof the Republic of South Africa, 1996 1997 (2) SA 97 (CC) (Second Certification Judgment).10The new Constitutional Court in one of its first judgments, delivered in 1995, noted that “[i]n some countries, the Constitution only formalizes,in a legal instrument, a historical consensus of values and aspirations evolved incrementally from a stable and unbroken past to accommodate the needsof the future. The South African Constitution is different: it retains from the past only what is defensible and represents a decisive break from, and aringing rejection of, that part of the past which is disgracefully racist, authoritarian, insular and repressive and a vigorous identification of and commitmentto a democratic, universalistic, caring and aspirationally egalitarian ethos, expressly articulated in the Constitution. The contrast between the past whichit repudiates and the future to which it seeks to commit the nation is stark and dramatic”, S vMakwanyane 1995 (3) SA 391 (CC) at [262] (perMahomedJ).11 See s.1 of the Constitution. Professor Etienne Mureinik famously opined: “If the new Constitution is a bridge away from a culture of authority,it is clear what it must be a bridge to. It must lead to a culture of justification—a culture in which every exercise of power is expected to be justified;in which the leadership given by government rests on the cogency of the case offered in defence of its decisions, not the fear inspired by the force atits command. The new order must be a community built on persuasion, not coercion” (“A Bridge to Where? Introducing the Interim Bill of Rights”(1994) 10 S.A.J.H.R. 31 at 32). Quoted by the Constitutional Court, inter alia, in Prinsloo v Van der Linde 1997 (3) SA 1012 (CC) at [25]-[26].12 From Nelson Mandela’s inauguration speech, 10 May 1994.13 See, e.g. The Economist, 9 December 2017, where the lead article and cover was “The Corruption of South Africa”, which suggested a countrybroken by corruption and “state capture”, https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21732114-avoid-dire-two-decade-dynasty-dysfunction-south-africas240 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsBut constitutions, conceived in hope, show their mettle in times when democracy and the rule of laware under threat. And, indeed, a constitution that enshrines democracy, human rights and the rule of law,demonstrates its true value and necessity, like all pre-commitment devices, precisely when the siren callsof political expediency and avarice are at their loudest.South Africa’s Constitution has three key features that were to prove decisive when the rapaciousshadow of the Zuma-administration fell on Mandela’s “beautiful land”. First, it creates and entrenchesindependent institutions, including the judiciary, to, in various ways, act as guardians of the newly formedconstitutional democracy.14 Second, it enshrines the principle of constitutional sovereignty, which meansthat all exercises of public power are subject to constitutional control.15 Third, it provides for generousstanding grounds that ensure that violations of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights can be challengedby anyone acting in the public interest.16At a time characterised by Justice Cameron of the Constitutional Court as one “of structural disintegration,social fraying and predatory looting”,17 the underlying democratic principles encapsulated in the Constitutionwere tested in the crucible of numerous cases that were brought against President Zuma and his government,often by public interest litigants.Much litigation focused on rampant corruption, perhaps themost significantcause of declining optimism in the country’s potential and the greatest attempt at eroding South Africa’sdemocratic gains. These cases included a challenge to the legislation that sought to replace South Africa’sindependent and highly regarded corruption fighting unit with an institution which lacked independencefrom the government which it was taskedwith investigating.18The Constitutional Court upheld the challengeand found that the failure to provide an adequately independent corruption fighting unit violated both theConstitution and South Africa’s international obligations. In compelling and emotive language the Courtnoted that “corruption threatens to fell at the knees virtually everything we hold dear and precious in ourhard-won constitutional order. It blatantly undermines the democratic ethos, the institutions of democracy,the rule of law and the foundational values of our nascent constitutional project”. The Court orderedParliament to amend the legislation to remedy the deficiencies so as to ensure that the independence ofthe corruption fighting unit was properly secured, so that it could fulfil its mandate to investigate corruption,including in government, without fear or favour. When Parliament, despite being ordered by theConstitutional Court to amend the unconstitutional legislation, still failed to make sufficient amendmentsto ensure the independence of the new institution, in a subsequent case, brought by a public interest NGO,the Court itself ultimately amended the legislation to ensure that independence was guaranteed.19The government then, in what could only be seen as a brazen and deeply cynical move, proceeded toappoint a new head of the independent corruption unit, who was clearly unfit for office. This attempt bythe government to stifle the institution and its primary mandate (the investigation and uprooting of thecancerous corruption at the heart of government and public institutions), was again challenged by publicinterest NGOs. Ultimately, the Court set aside the appointment.20-ruling-anc-should-ditch and https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21732086-ruling-african-national-congress-ponders-choice-between-dynasty-and-reform-how-jacob-zuma [both Accessed 25 May 2018].14 In addition to establishing an independent judiciary, subject only to the Constitution and the rule of law, and tasked as the guardians of theConstitution, the Constitution created a variety of constitutional institutions to ensure accountability and independent monitoring of government. Theseinclude an independent National Prosecuting Authority, the Public Protector (who has broad powers to investigate any conduct in state affairs or inpublic administration in any sphere of government that is alleged or suspected to be improper), the Auditor General (tasked with independently auditingand reporting on the financial management of national, provincial and local government departments) and the Electoral Commission (tasked withindependently ensuring free and fair elections).15Affordable Medicines Trust v Minister of Health 2006 (3) SA 247 (CC) at [48]; Kaunda v President of the Republic of South Africa 2005 (4) SA235 (CC) at [78]-[80].16Constitution s.38.

TheConstitutional Court’s judgment in graphic and powerful terms began by sounding a clarion call foraccountability and the rule of law, while issuing a stinging rebuke to the avarice of the Zuma-administration(especially as, in a break with tradition, the Chief Justice read out the judgment, which was carried liveon TV and online):“One of the crucial elements of our constitutional vision is to make a decisive break from theunchecked abuse of State power and resources that was virtually institutionalised during the apartheidera. To achieve this goal, we adopted accountability, the rule of law and the supremacy of theConstitution as values of our constitutional democracy. For this reason, public office-bearers ignoretheir constitutional obligations at their peril. This is so because constitutionalism, accountability andthe rule of law constitute the sharp and mighty sword that stands ready to chop the ugly head ofimpunity off its stiffened neck.”During the Zuma-era, the courts were also confronted with cases arising from the government’s attemptsto bypass Parliament (and simultaneously avoiding the public consultation that Parliament is constitutionallymandated to ensure when it acts). One case stands out for particular discussion, at a time when the worldfaces repeated news of evidence that the Russian government of President Putin is engaged in efforts toundermine and interfere in the democratic processes of other nations.22 TheWestern Cape High Court wasfaced with a challenge to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in relation to nuclearcooperation and procurement between the Russian and South African Governments.23 The agreementformed part of the Zuma government’s reckless pursuit of the trillion-rand procurement of new nuclearpower plants that was neither necessary nor affordable, and where concerns had been raised that theagreement was the result of corrupt practices. The South Africa-Russia agreement made a number ofsubstantive commitments in relation to nuclear procurement (including granting the Russian governmentfull indemnity from any liability and the right to veto the involvement of any other country in theconstruction of the plants). The Zuma-government sought to bypass the constitutional requirement thatparliamentary approval must be sought and obtained to make international agreements binding on theRepublic. The government had sought to achieve this by improperly tabling the agreement before Parliamentunder a section which did not require parliamentary approval but merely notificatory tabling (which sectionwas only applicable to run-of-the-mill agreements of no substantive moment, which did not warrantparliamentary and public scrutiny). The Court, in an application brought by two environmental NGOs,set aside the unconstitutional actions of government, and required that if the government wished to bindSouth Africa to the agreement it would have to obtain parliamentary approval (which would involve apublic consultation process). The case (which also set aside certain domestic actions necessary for newnuclear procurement) was widely viewed as the effective death knell of the Zuma government’s perniciousnuclear build programme (broadly criticised as allegedly aimed at the corrupt enrichment of Zuma andhis associates).The victory is not to be underestimated. The two activists behind the case were recently awarded theGoldman Environmental Prize, the world’s largest award honouring grassroots environmental activists,21Economic Freedom Fighters v Speaker of the National Assembly; Democratic Alliance v Speaker of the National Assembly [2016] ZACC 11;2016 (3) SA 580 (CC).22 See, e.g. The Economist, 24 February 2018, with the cover and lead story being “The Meddler: How Putin meddles in Western democracies”,https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21737276-and-why-wests-response-inadequate-how-putin-meddles-western-democracies [Accessed 25May2018].23Earthlife Africa v Minister of Energy 2017 (5) SA 227 (WCC).242 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsfor “stopping their government’s massive secret nuclear deal with Russia—a deal that would have threatenedthe country’s health, environment and finances”.24 As The Guardian reported, the court victory was amajor setback for Putin’s plans to increase Russia’s income and influence, and may have contributed tothe fall of Zuma after nine years in power.25 The South African nuclear case is thus a small but importantexample of a country—through its courts, and civil society—standing up to insidious attempts to underminedemocracy.In another attempt to bypass constitutional and democratic safeguards in relation to the conducting offoreign affairs, the Zuma-government sought to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC).This followed criticism levelled against South Africa for failing to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashirpursuant to two arrest warrants issued by the ICC. This occurred notwithstanding an interim Court orderrequiring the government to prevent President al-Bashir’s departure from the country (where he had beenattending anAfricanUnion summit) pending the determination of urgent litigation to compel the governmentto arrest him.26Ultimately, the Supreme Court of Appeal held that the government had violated its domesticlegislation which implemented South Africa’s obligations under the Rome Statute by failing to arrestPresident al-Bashir.27 In October 2016, the government without any public notice or consultation, and,importantly, absent parliamentary approval, summarily deposited a notice of withdrawal from the RomeStatute with the UN Secretary General. This decision was urgently and successfully challenged in thecourts by the official opposition party and numerous public interest NGOs.28 The Pretoria High Courtfound that government had violated the Constitution by bypassing Parliament and simply depositing anotice of withdrawal absent parliamentary approval (and, thus, short-circuiting the concomitant publicconsultation process that a proper parliamentary approval process would have involved). The governmentwas ordered to rescind its notice of withdrawal, which it duly did (depositing the embarrassingly titled“Withdrawal of Notice of Withdrawal” with the UN Secretary General).29More recently, litigation has resulted from the Zuma government’s decision in August 2017 to grantGrace Mugabe, the wife of the then Zimbabwean President, Robert Mugabe, immunity from prosecutionfollowing her, alleged assault of a young woman in South Africa. The decision to grant immunity wastaken after a criminal case had been opened against Ms Mugabe for assault with the intent to do grievousbodily harm, and notwithstanding that (and perhaps, precisely because) the prosecuting authorities hadformerly advised the government that there was a prima facie case against Ms Mugabe. This decision waschallenged in the Pretoria High Court on the basis that it was unconstitutional, unlawful, and violatedrights in the Bill of Rights and, as at the time of writing, judgment is awaited following argument beforethe Court. The challenge was brought by an opposition political party, a public interest NGO, and theyoung woman who was allegedly assaulted, and was supported by a number of public interest NGOs(acting as friends of the court).But Courts, and public interest litigants, do not operate in a vacuum. Nor were they alone in holdingthe Zuma government to account.South Africa has a free and vigorous press, staffed by courageous journalists. Throughout the Zuma-erathe press, through conscientious investigative journalism, laid bare the extent of the rot at the heart of the24 “The Women Who Stopped the Nuclear Deal” New Internationalist, 23 April 2018, https://newint.org/features/web-exclusive/2018/04/23/women-stopped-nuclear-deal [Accessed 25 May 2018].25 J.

Indeed, as The Economist noted, “[w]hat is unusual about South Africa is not thatcorruption thrives, but that it does so in plain sight. Thanks to a history of civic activism, a free press anda robust judiciary, South Africans are aware of the wholesale theft. Investigative journalists have cataloguedcorruption at all levels of government”.30 For instance, investigative journalists at different media housescollaborated to analyse and break stories, over manymonths, arising from hundreds of thousands of leakedemails (provided by whistle-blowers) that related to the Guptas, a family of businessmen at the centre ofthe state capture allegations, who stand accused of extensive corruption and the manipulation of stateinstitutions and departments for their own enrichment.31Beyond merely engaging in public interest litigation, civil society has actively sought to hold theZuma-administration to account and bring to an end a culture of impunity and the looting of state resources.Various civil society organisations made sure that they could not be ignored. They demanded that theirconcerns be addressed, through rallies, protests and numerous engagements with government.32It is precisely because courts do not operate in a vacuum, and are, and must be, responsive to the politicaland societal moment in which they find themselves, that South Africa’s irrepressible civil society andpress also played another important role. In holding the Zuma-administration to account and ensuringtransparency in the public square, the press and civil society effectively created the necessary space andcontext for the courts to make many of their brave decisions in defence of democracy and constitutionalrights and principles: setting aside government decisions at the highest level (including in relation to thestaffing of constitutional institutions and the conducting of foreign affairs), rewriting legislation, andstalling a nuclear procurement programme with the Russian government. In other times, and in differentcontexts, many of these decisions may have been criticised as unacceptable encroachments upon executivepower. Despite predictable efforts by Zuma-acolytes and others within government to cast certain of theCourt’s decisions as unacceptable judicial intrusion into the executive realm,33 and with certain courtscautioning that not every political dispute could be resolved by the judges,34 on the whole the judgmentswere rightly lauded by a society that had lost trust in the Zuma-administration.This, of course, raises interesting and important jurisprudential questions about the role of courts intimes of social and constitutional turmoil; and how the South African courts were able to continue to makebold decisions, not only openly critical of government but even prescriptive of how it should act, whilemanaging to retain their institutional authority and credibility, and with government still implementing35and publicly acknowledging that it will respect those decisions.36We cannot hope to do those issues justicein this article. However, part of the answer may lie in three interwoven points. First, the South AfricanConstitution is autochthonous. It was not imposed from afar. It is the manifestation and cornerstone ofSouth Africa’s peaceful and negotiated transition to democracy after long years of struggle against apartheidand colonialism. It represents the hopes and aspirations, as well as the fears, of the disparate but united30 “The choice that could save South Africa, or wreck it”, The Economist, 9 December 2017.31 See generally, http://www.gupta-leaks.com/ [Accessed 25 May 2018], where much of this journalism has conveniently been collected.32By way of example, see https://www.savesouthafrica.org/ [Accessed 25 May 2018].33For example, in 2015, after the High Court judgment in the President al-Bashir case discussed above, theMinister of Higher Education complainedthat the “judiciary tend to somehow overreach” into areas that were for the executive and that there was a danger of Parliament and the executive beingrun by the courts (see https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/sacp-calls-for-summit-on-judiciary-1882432 [Accesed 25 May 2018]).34 See the judgment by Davis J inMazibuko v Sisulu 2013 (4) SA 243 (WCC) at 256E-H, warning that “Courts do not run the country, nor werethey intended to govern the country. Courts exist to police the constitutional boundaries, as I have sketched them. … There is a danger in South Africahowever of the politicisation of the judiciary, drawing the judiciary into every and all political disputes, as if there is no other forum to deal with apolitical impasse relating to policy, or disputes which clearly carry polycentric consequences beyond the scope of adjudication”.35By and large, that is. There were instance where orders were not implemented. See “A Review of Concourt and SCA Decisions: Undermining orEmpowering the Rule of Law?”, available at https://hsf.org.za/publications/hsf-briefs/a-review-of-concourt-decisions-undermining-or-empowering-the-rule-of-law [Accessed 25 May 2018]. Oftentimes the failure to comply may have been attributed to lack of resources or skills. But there have beenoccasions of wanton non-compliance. Perhaps most infamously was the government’s failure to comply with the court order requiring it to ensure thatPresident al-Bashir of Sudan was arrested pursuant to an international arrest warrant issued by the ICC in relation to charges of crimes against humanity,war crimes and genocide. SeeMinister of Justice v South African Litigation Centre 2016 (3) SA 317 (SCA) at [5]-[7].36 For an insightful article that considers how the Constitutional Court built and maintained its institutional security from 1995 to 2006 see TheunisRoux, “Principle and pragmatism on the Constitutional Court of South Africa” (2009) 7(1) International Journal of Constitutional Law 106.244 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorspeople of the new South Africa. It is owned by them and claimed by them. Second, the Constitution itselfrecognises the role of the courts as the guardians of the Constitution, and empowers them with the broadremedial powers they have used. The courts did not aggregate this role to themselves, rather the Constitutionitself demanded it of them. It emphatically states that the courts “must declare that any law or conductthat is inconsistent with the Constitution is invalid to the extent of its inconsistency”,37 and it then requiresthe courts to exercise the broad discretion to devise “just and equitable” remedies to deal with the resultinginvalidity.38 Third, because of the guardian role that South Africa’s autochthonous Constitution envisagesfor the courts, at times of crisis and when constitutional principles and rights, including socio-economicrights, are under threat, it is to the courts that citizens have turned for assistance—and people defendinstitutions which defend them. A dramatic example of this is that in the midst of a social grants crisis in2017, where it appeared that the provision of social grants to some 17 million recipients39 was threatenedwith collapse due to admitted maladministration by the government, civil society organisations turned tothe Constitutional Court. An urgent hearing was convened and a full judgment delivered a mere two dayslater.40 As the Court pointed out in its opening paragraph of its judgment:“[o]ne of the signature achievements of our constitutional democracy is the establishment of aninclusive and effective programme of social assistance. It has had a material impact in reducingpoverty and inequality and in mitigating the consequences of high levels of unemployment. In sodoing it has given some content to the core constitutional values of dignity, equality and freedom.This judgment is, however, not an occasion to celebrate this achievement. To the contrary, it isnecessitated by the extraordinary conduct of the Minister of Social Development (Minister) and ofthe South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) that have placed that achievement in jeopardy.”In the judgment the Court crafted an order to ensure that social grants (the right to social assistancebeing a constitutionally protected right) would continue to be paid,41 under a special regime which includednot only regular reporting by government to the Court but also the creation of an expert panel to overseethe process and report to the Court. Yet, the Court was mindful that the urgent national crisis confrontingit and the country, while requiring it to step into the breach created by government neglect, was testingthe limits of its legitimate remedial power. In defending its order it pointed out that, “[i]t is necessary tobe frank about this exercise of our just and equitable remedial power. That power is not limitless and theorder we make today pushes at its limits. It is a remedy that must be used with caution and only inexceptional circumstances. But these are exceptional circumstances”.42 Also, of note, in a first for theCourt, and as a mark of the Court’s displeasure at the apparent inaction by the Minister of SocialDevelopment, it sought to ensure that the Minister, who was ultimately responsible for the payment of37Constitution s.172(1)(a).38Constitution s.172(1)(b).39Of a population of 52 million, there are officially over 10 million social grants beneficiaries, the number climbs to approximately 17 million, whenone includes the children in respect of whom the beneficiaries receive child care grants.40Black Sash Trust v Minister of Social Development (Freedom Under Law NPC Intervening) [2017] ZACC 8; 2017 (3) SA 335 (CC).41The Court ordered that the private company that had been making the payments of all social grants on the government’s behalf would have tocontinue to do so, given that no-one else was in a position to provide the service. The private company’s ongoing duty to continue to ensure that socialgrants were paid was sourced not in contract but in the company’s constitutional obligations. The private company had previously been paying socialgrants pursuant to a contract that the Constitutional Court had declared invalid (due to unlawfulness in the tender pursuant to which the contract wasawarded), but which invalidity had been suspended by the Court to ensure that grants were still paid while government either successfully appointeda new private company by way of lawful tender or took over the service itself. Government’s failure to do either, and to timeously advise the Court ofits failure, prior to the term of the social grants contract (kept in place by the suspension of invalidity) coming to its end, precipitated the social grantscrisis. See Black Sash Trust v Minister of Social Development [2017] ZACC 8; 2017 (3) SA 335 (CC) at [40]-[52], and the previous judgment, AllPayConsolidated Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd v Chief Executive Officer of the South African Social Security Agency (No.2) [2014] ZACC 12; 2014 (4)SA 179 (CC). For a full discussion of AllPay see Max du Plessis and Andreas Coutsoudis, “Considering corruption through the AllPay lens: on thelimits of judicial review, strengthening accountability, and the long arm of the law” (2016) 4 S.A.L.J. 755.42Black Sash [2017] ZACC 8; 2017 (3) SA 335 (CC) at [51]. The Court went on to point out that: “Everyone stressed that what has happened hasprecipitated a national crisis. The order we make imposes constitutional obligations on the parties that they did not in advance agree to. But we are notordering something that they could not themselves have agreed to under our supervision had an application been brought earlier, either by seeking anextension to the contract that would have expired on 31 March 2017 or by entering into a new one.”Falls the Shadow—Defending Democracy in South Africa and Across the World 245[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorssocial grants, was, to the extent necessary, held personally accountable: in its judgment it ordered theMinister to file an affidavit to show cause why she should not be joined in her personal capacity to thelitigation and ordered to pay the costs of the litigation personally.43The above discussion of key cases and their implications is necessarily selective and brief. But it leavesus here: in the last 10 years South Africa has seen the importance of constitutionally entrenched independentinstitutions and mechanisms for accountability and transparency, and, perhaps most important, the needfor an active and engaged citizenry and civil society, who are given proper constitutional agency. AsJustice Cameron recently remarked, “Courts can give a constitution air and breath. The legislature andthe executive can give it muscle. But its lifeblood depends on an active citizenry”.44Constitutionally created and empowered institutions, such as the Public Protector, also played theirpart. Thuli Madonsela, the public protector for much of the Zuma-era, was active and effective ininvestigating abuses of power. In addition to the investigation and report which ultimately forced Zumato repay the public money improperly spent on his private residence, the Public Protector’s other reportsrange from a minister’s splurge on trips to Switzerland to visit his girlfriend using state resources,45 to thereport on “state capture” which implicated former President Zuma and other public officials in apparentlyillicit relationships with certain business associates aimed at the looting of public funds on a grand scale.This report required former President Zuma to exercise his power to establish a commission of inquiry toinvestigate the state capture. The former President was required to appoint a judge chosen by the ChiefJustice (this particular innovation by the Public Protector was included to protect against any attempt byPresident Zuma to compromise the independence of any inquiry into corrupt activities in which he wasimplicated). After more litigation (including a failed attempt by former President Zuma to review and setaside the Public Protector’s report),46 the Commission on State Capture, headed by the Deputy ChiefJustice (as selected by the Chief Justice) has been established and has begun its investigations.During the Zuma-era, it was not only the courts, and other constitutional institutions such as the PublicProtector, that played their part in protecting our constitutional democracy, human rights and the rule oflaw. Parliament (including government-party MPs) has, albeit belatedly, in the face of numerousadmonitions by the courts and the groundswell of negative public opinion in relation to corruption, stoppedrubber-stamping decisions of state-owned enterprises and government departments and has taken on amore robust role in scrutinising such decisions. And, in the 2016 local government elections, given thewidespread corruption and maladministration that had been allowed to flourish under the Zumaadministration, voters began to turn away from the ANC. It lost control of the major metros, thusconfronting, for the first time, the risk of being relegated to a rural political party, and facing the realpossibility of a humiliating performance in the upcoming 2019 national elections. The 2016 election resultsand what they betoken for the ANC played no small part in seeing the ANC, at its internal conference atthe end of December 2017, electing the pragmatic and principled Cyril Ramaphosa as its new President,defeating President Zuma’s favoured successor (his former wife). Within three months, President Zumawas forced to resign by the ANC, and Ramaphosa was sworn in as the new President of South Africa. Afew weeks thereafter, Jacob Zuma sat humbled in a courtroom in Durban, facing criminal charges inrelation to racketeering, corruption, money laundering and fraud. These charges had been reinstated bythe prosecuting authority due mostly to the persistent litigation of the official opposition party. In October43Given the conflicting versions in the Minister’s personal costs affidavit and those of the CEO of the social grants agency and the former DirectorGeneral of the Minister’s department (who had, unexpectedly, both filed affidavits questioning aspects of the Minister’s affidavit), the Court, in aseparate judgment, ordered a judicial enquiry to resolve the disputes of fact so that the Court could determine whether the Minister had acted in goodfaith. See Black Sash Trust v Minister of Social Development (Freedom Under Law NPC Intervening) (CCT48/17) [2017] ZACC 20; 2017 (9) BCLR1089 (CC).44Edwin Cameron, Safeguarding the Constitution and the Rule of Law, 4th Congress of the Conference of Constitutional Jurisdictions of Africa,April 2017, http://www.judiciary.org.za/images/phocadownload/ccja/CCJA-24-April-2017_Justice-Edwin-Cameron.pdf [Accessed 25 May 2018].45The late Mr Sicelo Shiceka.46President of the Republic of South Africa v Office of the Public Protector [2017] ZAGPPHC 747; 2018 (2) SA 100 (GP) (13 December 2017).246 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors2017, it eventually prevailed and the decision by the Acting National Director of Public Prosecution inApril 2009 to discontinue the prosecution of Zuma on over 700 corruption charges was set aside by theSupreme Court of Appeal on the basis that the decision to stop the prosecution was irrational andunconstitutional.47It is too early to predict whether President Ramaphosa will restore and rebuild all that was physicallyand metaphorically broken in what may come to be thought of as South Africa’s lost-decade. But thereare alreadymany reasons for optimism (including the appointment of twowidely respected formerMinistersof Finance, both of whom had been summarily fired by President Zuma from the position, 48 allegedly tofurther the aims of state capture, to head the National Treasury and the Department of Public Enterprisesrespectively), and hopes run high for the man that famously Nelson Mandela wanted to succeed him asPresident.One of the areas that is in need of urgent restoration is South Africa’s international relations. Under theZuma administration, South Africa lost its way, and its voice, in foreign affairs. Vision and principle werereplaced by the haphazard, expedient and short-sighted—perhaps best exemplified by the ill-fated attemptto withdraw from the ICC.49As South Africa enters a new era its international relations aims and engagements must once again beguided by the core values of its Constitution (human dignity, equality, freedom and the rule of law) andthe Constitution’s transformative commitment and character—actively seeking to ensure a better futurewhile fully cognisant of the injustice-riven realities of the present. As a matter of domestic commitmentand focus, the Constitution demands nothing less of the Ramaphosa administration when it acts globally.50More importantly, in an era of authoritarians and demagogues, when there is a sense that a shadow hasfallen over democracy, and the once self-evident commitments to human rights, social justice, and therule of law seem under threat, South Africa has a role to regain. It has an opportunity to heed the wordsof Mandela, and the demands of its own Constitution, and “take up its rightful and responsible place inthe community of nations”.51Through its ownweathering of the democratic storm over the last decade, and its once-thought-impossiblepeaceful transition to democracy in the decade-and-a-half before that, South Africa has both practicalinsights and a moral resilience gained the hard way.There is a present and urgent yearning in South Africa and, we suggest elsewhere, for leadership thatis principled and inclusive, that builds bridges rather than destroys them, and which is rooted in a respectfor everyone’s rights rather than a derisive dismissal of others that are different. South Africa’s democraticlessons were forged in the crucible of a bruising past and its transition from apartheid to constitutionaldemocracy, and—we believe—these have been tested and strengthened in the last 10 years under a venaland avaricious President. But its democratic future, as with all other nations, is not to be taken for granted,particularly at this time in world history. A stronger and inclusive democracy remains vital for South47 Zuma v Democratic Alliance; Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions v Democratic Alliance [2017] ZASCA 146; 2018 (1) SA 200(SCA).48 In December 2015, President Zuma fired Nhlanhla Nene as Minister of Finance. President Zuma appointed as Nene’s successor an unheard-ofparliamentarian with no relevant experience, which created such political and societal outrage, and economic turmoil, that was he forced a few dayslater to appoint the highly regarded Pravin Gordhan, who had been Minister of Finance before Nene, to the position again. Then in March 2017,President Zuma fired Pravin Gordhan. Since taking over the Presidency, President Ramaphosa has restored sanity by appointing Nene as the Ministerof Finance and Gordhan as the Minister of Public Enterprises.49On this, see further Max du Plessis, “South Africa’s latest threat to withdraw from the ICC, or, How to Squander Leadership”, Daily Maverick,11 December 2017, https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2017-12-11-south-africas-latest-threat-to-withdraw-from-the-icc-or-how-to-squander-leadership/#.WuPzsy-B2gw [Accessed 25 May 2018].50As the Constitutional Court recently emphasised, Mandela’s outline of South Africa’s future foreign policy in 1993 (that human rights should bethe core concern of international relations, and that South Africa should be ready to play a role in fostering peace and prosperity in the world we sharewith the community of nations, and that the time had come for South Africa to take up its rightful and responsible place in the community of nations)“is echoed in the preamble to the Constitution where it is stated: ‘We, the people of South Africa, … adopt this Constitution as the supreme law of theRepublic so as to … Build a united and democratic South Africa able to take its rightful place as a sovereign state in the family of nations’”, NationalCommissioner of Police v Southern African Human Rights Litigation Centre 2015 (1) SA 315 (CC).51Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s Future Foreign Policy (1993) 72(5) Foreign Affairs.Falls the Shadow—Defending Democracy in South Africa and Across the World 247[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsAfrica to achieve its Constitution’s transformative commitments domestically.

Drawing on insights fromcomparative law, this article argues that whether legal moves beyond the binary are desirable or notdepends in large part on the rationale that undergirds them, and examines several potential rationales.At its best, legal gender recognition for non-binary persons should aim to foster self-determination withina larger social fabric of existence, both by supporting non-binary persons in day-to-day interactions andby challenging the self-evidence of the gender binary. By reference to the case-law of the European Courtof Human Rights on transgender rights, the article examines whether such a rationale could already besaid to lie latent in European jurisprudence.IntroductionOn 10 October 2017, the German Constitutional Court ruled that it is unconstitutional to retain legal gendermarkers so long as they are restricted to only male and female, with no affirmative designation possiblebeyond these two options.1 This judgment constitutes a particularly emphatic intervention within a broaderdevelopment, in legal systems across the globe, to acknowledge the limits of the gender binary. Explicitrecognition of non-binary or otherwise gender-variant persons2 had previously found its way, for example,into the legal systems of Australia, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan and parts of the US,with contestation or reform of the binary system also reported to be ongoing in many other states. Suchdevelopments are usually quite limited in scope (restricted, for example, to certain issues such as passports,census categories or birth certificates) or plagued by a lack of proper implementation beyond initial, oftenjudicial, pronouncements—but they nonetheless serve to showcase that non-binary persons are slowlybeing written into legal existence.3With the judgment of the German Constitutional Court as well as recent policy changes in Malta, themove beyond the gender binary has now arrived in Europe. Further challenges by way of judicial*A previous version of this article was presented at an expert seminar on trans rights, organised by Eva Brems and Pieter Cannoot at the HumanRights Centre of Ghent University; many thanks are due to all the participants of that seminar for the insightful comments and discussions, and alsoto Katharina Wommelsdorff, Felix Bieker, Damian Gonzalez-Salzberg and Kay Lalor for reading drafts of the article in its various stages and offeringfurther helpful comments.1German Federal Constitutional Court, App. No.1 BvR 2019/16 decision of 10 October 2017; for more context, see fn.28 below.2 In what follows, I will use only the term “non-binary”. Not all persons outside of the gender binary identify with this term (or even accept thedichotomy between binary and non-binary); its use here is not intended to be prescriptive.3To borrow a phrase from A. Sharpe, Transgender Jurisprudence. Dysphoric Bodies of Law (London and New York: Cavendish, 2002), p.80.249[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsproceedings are ongoing, for example, in Austria, Belgium and the UK4; and there is hope that the Germanjudgment will push the courts seized of these cases to rethink the binary assumptions which, until now,have so often been taken for granted within Europe. Against the backdrop of these ongoing challengesand the questions they open up for courts across Europe, this article will reflect on the rationale of legalgender recognition for non-binary persons in relation to previous European jurisprudence on transgenderrights. Building on the judgment of the German Constitutional Court and other judicial pronouncementsin favour of non-binary recognition from outside Europe and using the case-law of the European Courtof Human Rights as a foil,5 I will discuss whether moving beyond the gender binary constitutes a simpleextension of previous rationales for legal gender recognition or whether it necessitates a more radical shiftin thinking about how and why we retain legal gender markers.Legal sex or legal gender: confronting (bio)logicWithin Europe, the landmark case for transgender rights is commonly considered to be the judgment bythe European Court of Human Rights in Goodwin, which established a right to legal gender recognitionas part of the right to private life (art.8 of the ECHR) as well as the relevance of the gender thus recognisedfor the purposes of marriage (art.12 of the ECHR).6 Yet while this ruling obliged the State Parties toprovide for some kind of legal gender recognition, it took the view that the “appropriate means” for doingso fall within their margin of appreciation,7 and subsequent judgments have mostly rubber-stamped variousbarriers to recognition.For present purposes, it is particularly relevant to note that, in Goodwin, the Court itself restricted itsruling to “post-operative transsexuals”.8 In other words, while acknowledging a person’s gender identitymay be the driving factor behind legal gender recognition, a right to such recognition remains dependenton bodily modification by way of hormone therapy and surgery. On this approach, legal gender recognitionremains grounded in a concern with anatomy which Alex Sharpe has dubbed (bio)logic.9 As DamianGonzalez-Salzberg summarised it with regard to the Court’s position at the time, legally relevant genderis “no longer determined by an immutable ‘biological’ truth of the body, but it is found in the surgicallymodified anatomy of the transsexual genitalia”.10A similar concern with (bio)logic may be found in various cases ostensibly establishing legal genderrecognition for non-binary persons—although, given the continued focus on anatomy, it may be moreaccurate to speak of “legal sex” than “legal gender”.11 This is perhaps most clearly in evidence in the caseof Norrie, in which the High Court of Australia ruled that it was permissible to change the applicant’s4 For updates on the latter, see https://elancane.livejournal.com [Accessed 25 May 2018].5 For a very cautious move beyond the binary within the broader Council of Europe system, see Parliamentary Assembly, Resolution 2048 (2015)at 6.2.4. Another possible point of reference is the legal order of the EU, which—similarly to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights—iscurrently phrased or interpreted predominantly within the gender binary but also carries the potential for its subversion. On both aspects (in the contextof intersexuality), see e.g. M. Travis, “Accommodating Intersexuality in European Union Anti-Discrimination Law” (2015) 21 European Law Journal180. I will, however, mostly leave EU law aside here—it is difficult to discern clear rationales for legal gender recognition in the case-law of theEuropean Court of Justice since it deals with civil status law only obliquely, through the lens of other areas of law (e.g. in cases relating to equality inpensions). See very clearly in that regard the recent opinion of Advocate-General Bobek inMB v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (C-451/16),5 December 2017, particularly at [22]-[29], [76], [79] and [98].6Goodwin v United Kingdom (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 447.7Goodwin (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 447 at [93]; see J.T.

Sandland, “Crossing and NotCrossing: Gender, Sexuality and Melancholy in the European Court of Human Rights” (2003) 11 Feminist Legal Studies 191, 200.11While I take sex to be socially constructed (see e.g. S.J. Kessler, Lessons from the Intersexed (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press,1998)), I use it here as a reference to biology (and anatomy in particular) in the way legal discourse commonly does.250 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorslegal sex from “male” to “non-specific”.12 It did so on the basis of the applicant’s submission that “thepurpose of the Register is to state the truth about matters recorded in the Register to the greatest possibleextent” and that, in light of the applicant’s “ambiguous” sex, “it would be to record misinformation in theRegister to classify her as male or female”.13 As Neuman Wipfler has argued, the High Court thus seeslegal gender as a form of truth-acknowledgment, while “locating the truth of gender in a person’s genitals”.14There are many drawbacks to such an approach. Let me highlight just one: the connection to theterminology applied to the non-binary option. Before appeal to the High Court, the New South WalesCourt of Appeal had ruled that besides “non-specific”, other “appropriate identifications such as ‘intersex’,‘androgenous’, [sic] or ‘transgender’, being words that appear to be recognised designations of sexualidentity, may be registered”.15While this is a relatively vague proclamation, the reference to “identifications”and “designations of sexual identity” as well as the mention of the term “transgender”, which is commonlyconnected more to gender identity and expression than to biology and anatomy,16 inject an element ofidentity-based self-declaration into the Court of Appeal’s approach. The High Court’s ruling, by contrast,remains firmly grounded in (bio)logic throughout. Accordingly, it rejected the multiplicity of possibleterms proposed by the Court of Appeal and instead allowed only the term “non-specific” to cover all thosepersons whose sex is considered to be “ambiguous”.17 Some non-binary persons may well accept or evenprefer such a designation, but as the developments in the German legal system mentioned below willdemonstrate, many will not find it sufficient—as Wallbank has noted, its vagueness makes it appear notso much as “a ‘third’ Legal Sex, but a catch-all Legal Sex indicating no Legal Sex classification or aNon-Sex Legal Sex”.18In light of its recent case-law, it seems unlikely that the European Court of Human Rights could relyon such “sex classification” rather than truly establish legal gender recognition for non-binary persons.While it has never formally abandoned its reliance on (bio)logic, its judgment in AP, Garçon and Nicotfound a violation of art.8 of the ECHR because legal gender recognition was made conditional on“sterilisation surgery or on treatment which, on account of its nature and intensity, entailed a very highprobability of sterility”.19 Surgical intervention in general is not explicitly discussed, nor is the judgment’srelation to the notion of “post-operative transsexuals” as encountered in Goodwin—but the importanceof physical integrity is stressed throughout the judgment,20 and it is difficult to imagine how the previousapproach could be upheld without risking inconsistency. Unless the Court adopts a highly regressivestance, then, it cannot mirror Norrie in perpetuating (bio)logic and treating the recording of anatomical“truth” as the rationale of legal gender recognition for non-binary persons.12High Court of Australia, NSW Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages v Norrie [2014] HCA 11.13NSW Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages v Norrie [2014] HCA 11 at [30].14A.J.A.

One of the most oftenand enthusiastically quoted passages from that judgment states that lack of legal gender recognition leadsto a “conflict between social reality and law” which “places the transsexual in an anomalous position, inwhich he or she may experience feelings of vulnerability, humiliation and anxiety”.21 Besides noting theuse of the pronouns “he or she”, which confirm the binary outlook of the European Court of Human Rights,wemay also ponder the reference to “social reality”. For many trans men and women, this is an intelligibleconcept—they will, at some point during or after their transition, pass as male or female, respectively,and by obtaining legal recognition of their gender, the chance that they will be unwillingly outed as transis greatly reduced. They can thus, as Paul Kavanagh put it, achieve “the freedom, like everyone else, toslip quietly into the crowd”.22This is an important rationale, and slipping quietly into the crowd should certainly be an option forthose who wish it. Yet even within the gender binary, this rationale by no means covers all trans men andwomen, particularly those whose “social reality” is less clear-cut because they do not conform to genderstereotypes regarding their conduct and appearance.23 Most legal regimes, including courts that havetraditionally been quite active in combatting restrictive regimes of legal gender recognition, continue toaccept preconditions relating to the visual appearance of trans persons as legitimate,24 thus forcing themto create an ostensibly coherent “social reality” which contrasts with their legal classification before theyare allowed to change the latter.Focusing specifically on recognition of non-binary persons brings the problems involved in this approachinto stark relief. Given the binary outlook which continues to be deeply inscribed into the fabric of most(Western) societies, can we even imagine what a culturally legible “social reality” for non-binary personswould look like? On the rare occasions on which a person’s gender presentation differs so drastically fromthe common norms that they cannot be easily identified as either male or female, they will nonethelessbe measured against that binary, leading to confusion at best—“you should be women, and yet your beardsforbid me to interpret that you are so”25—or violence at worst.26 It seems unlikely, therefore, that non-binarypersons would be able to “slip quietly into the crowd”.To be sure, by adapting their gender presentation in a certain way, some non-binary persons can passas male or female. Yet the crucial point is that a non-binary legal gender will make this more difficultsince it will show them to be at variation from the gender binary in those situations in which legal genderbecomes relevant, and thus make them stand out.27 In other words, contrary to the argument of the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights that legal gender recognition (within the binary) allows trans persons to pass ascisgender and avoid an “anomalous position”, legal gender recognition for non-binary persons showcasesand confirms their difference from dominant gender norms. Far from allowing them to “slip quietly intothe crowd”, it becomes, in a sense, the confirmation of a position of involuntary defiance in the face ofthe gender binary.The judgment of the German Constitutional Court is particularly helpful to illustrate this shift inperspective. The crux of that case was whether a blank space, as already provided for under German law21Goodwin (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 447 at [77].22 P. Kavanagh, “Slipping Quietly into the Crowd—UK Transsexuals Finally out of Exile” (2005) 9 Mountbatten Journal of Legal Studies 21, 42.23 See critically Sharpe, Transgender Jurisprudence.

Namaste, Invisible Lives: The Erasure of Transsexual and Transgendered People (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000),ch.6, particularly p.144 on the gender binary.27Hence the importance of avoiding it for those who do not wish it; see fn.57 below.252 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsfor intersex persons,28 provided sufficient legal gender recognition. The Constitutional Court held that itdoes not:“The blank space retains the exclusively binary model of gender and creates the impression thatthe legal recognition of an additional gender identity is not an option, with the entry of a legalgender instead being merely unsettled, unresolved or forgotten about. This does not constituterecognition of the applicant’s own experience of gender.”29The legislator was instructed to adapt the regime of legal gender accordingly. Renouncing the notionof legal gender altogether would be one permissible option30; so long as it is retained, all current options(male, female, blank space) must likewise be retained,31 as well as being supplemented by an additional“uniform affirmative designation” (einheitliche positive Bezeichnung).32This notion of an affirmative designation (or “empowering terminology”, as an Australian report putit33) rather than a blank spacemakes the point of legal gender recognition for non-binary persons particularlyclear. The Constitutional Court further argued that the lack of such a designation “makes it more difficultfor those concerned to move in public and be perceived by others as a person of the gender which theyare” and that it contributes, in day-to-day interactions influenced by legal gender, to a lack of recognitionwith the same “self-evidence” (Selbstverständlichkeit) as male or female persons.34 An affirmativedesignation, it may be concluded by way of contrast, would be a step towards empowering non-binarypersons by disrupting the self-evidence of the gender binary—proactive recognition by the law “couldhave a powerful personally validating and socially authorising effect”.35 As with those trans men andwomen who do not get read as unambiguously male or female, respectively, legal gender recognition fornon-binary persons thus “places the weight of the state behind the trans person” in everyday interactions,36and provides “an authoritative resource in situations of perceived gender misrecognition”.37Self-determination and social transformationLet me further develop the matter through a different prism. Another rationale that has often been said tounderlie legal gender recognition is that of personal autonomy or self-determination. For example, theEuropean Court of Human Rights has cited these notions both in Goodwin and in a number of subsequent28 Paragraph 22(3) of Personenstandsgesetz (PStG), inserted by amendment of 7 May 2013, Bundesgesetzblatt 2013 I, p.1122: “If the child can beassigned to neither the female nor the male sex, then entry into the birth register is to be made without any such specification”. I should note that whilemy focus here is on non-binary recognition, whether for those intersex persons who identify as such or for trans persons, this issue cannot resolve themost pressing concern of many intersex activists: preventing non-consensual surgeries on intersex infants; see R. Hupf, “Allyship to the IntersexCommunity on Cosmetic, Non-Consensual Genital ‘Normalizing’ Surgery” (2015) 22 William & Mary Journal of Women and the Law 73.29German Federal Constitutional Court, App. No.1 BvR 2019/16 at [43].

The German Constitutional Courtbased its argument on the general right to self-determination of one’s personality, to which it held thelegal recognition of one’s gender identity to be inextricably connected,39 while the Supreme Court of India,in its NALSA judgment on recognition of a “third gender”, referred repeatedly to principles like personalautonomy and self-determination throughout its reasoning.40If there seems to be general agreement on the importance of self-determination as a rationale for legalgender recognition, then much turns on how that concept is understood. Judith Butler has distinguishedbetween two different conceptions: one that is “individualist, if not libertarian”,41 and one which is moresensitive to societal context. She favours the latter, arguing that “we must be part of a larger social fabricof existence in order to create who we are”,42 and that “self-determination becomes a plausible conceptonly in the context of a social world that supports and enables [an] exercise of agency”.43 Indeed, both theapproaches discussed in the preceding section—enabling trans men and women to “slip quietly into thecrowd” as well as providing legal affirmation to non-binary persons—in some way take into account theeveryday context within which trans persons are situated, i.e. their interactions with other people whohave a particular understanding of gender. In that sense, the two approaches are structurally similar,although they then go on to twist these interactions between an individual and society at large in verydifferent directions (the possibility of passing and the affirmation of difference, respectively).These differences become more prevalent when we further broaden our perspective to include theimplications of a contextualised understanding of self-determination. Assuming that self-determinationis only possible within “a larger social fabric of existence”, Judith Butler argues that “changing theinstitutions by which humanly viable choice is established andmaintained is a prerequisite for the exerciseof self-determination”, and thus that “individual agency is bound up with social critique and socialtransformation”.44 In other words: If self-determination is dependent on societal context, then it becomescrucial to change said context in such a way as to increasingly make self-determination possible.This aspect is entirely lacking within the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, whichaccepts a right to legal gender recognition in some contexts, but only in such a way that it does not challengebroader societal gender norms such as the gender binary.45 By way of contrast, consider the NALSAjudgment: Justice Sikri, in particular, argued that legal recognition of the “third gender” can only constitutethe “beginning” of a broader movement to “a dignified life of transgender people”.46 Sometimes, he notes,“a change in the law precedes societal change and is even intended to stimulate it”; in order to bring abouta “complete paradigm shift”—i.e. to move beyond the gender binary in the broader societal context—law38Goodwin (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 447 at [90]; van Kück v Germany (2003) 37 E.H.R.R. 51 at [73]; YY v Turkey (App. No.14793/08), judgment of 10March 2015 at [102]; AP, Garçon and Nicot v France (App. Nos 79885/12, 52471/13 and 52596/13), judgment of 6 April 2017 at [93]; see alsoInter-American Court of Human Rights, advisory opinion OC-24/17, esp. at [88] and [127].39German Federal Constitutional Court, App. No.1 BvR 2019/16 at [45].40Supreme Court of India, National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) v Union of India, Writ Petition (Civil) No.400 of 2012, esp. at [74]; see alsoe.g. at [20], [61], [67]-[68] and [70] (per K.S.

An “affirmative designation”for those non-binary persons who wish it, as proposed by the German Constitutional Court, would ideallyboth support them in day-to-day interactions in which legal gender becomes relevant and, in doing so,serve to challenge the gender binary and bring about societal change more generally.The implications of different rationalesI have treated different rationales for legal gender recognition of non-binary persons separately for thesake of analytical clarity, but it is important to note that, in practice, they do not usually appear in such aclear-cut manner. For example, whileNorriemost strongly emphasises the rationale of recording anatomical“truth”, elements of (bio)logic also shine through in the judgments of the Supreme Court of India and theGerman Constitutional Court. The prior classifies hijras as “third gender” in part because they “do nothave reproduction capacities as either men or women”51which, as AniruddhaDutta has noted, “homogenizesthe hijra community in reductive biological terms” and poses issues of both over- andunder-inclusiveness52—even though other passages in the same judgment contain a strong rhetoric infavour of self-declaration regardless of biological status.53 The reasoning of the German ConstitutionalCourt similarly refers to general notions of self-determination which build on its previous case-lawconcerning trans persons and can thus be read in a broad manner—yet, in light of the facts of the case,the ruling is formally restricted to intersex persons or, as the Court puts it, “persons whose sex developmentexhibits variations compared to male or female sex development”.54 It thus remains to be seen how inclusivethe legislator’s response will be.55Despite these amalgamations, I would argue that legal gender recognition for non-binary persons willtake a different form depending on which rationale(s) mainly underpin(s) it. Of the possible rationalescanvassed above, for example, a focus on recording anatomical “truth” will lead to a relatively static47 Supreme Court of India, NALSAWrit Petition (Civil) No.400 of 2012 at [119] (per A.K.

Finally,a form of recognition that seeks to foster self-determination within a larger social fabric of existence shouldbe more fluid and lay a stronger focus on empowering forms of “affirmative designation”, as well asaiming to reach beyond civil status law to also reform other areas of law and further disrupt the self-evidenceof the gender binary.58The different rationales are perhaps most radically in evidence if we consider when legal genderrecognition should take place. So long as recording anatomical “truth” remains an aim of the state, thecurrently widespread system of registration soon after birth—usually on the basis of phenomenologicalsex—can be said to contribute to that aim. Yet if the rationale of legal gender recognition is to fosterself-determination within a larger social fabric of existence, then classification by others, before one’slegal gender can be self-designated, simplymakes no sense59—rather, such externally imposed classificationsthen constitute an unnecessary “legal branding of a child”, as Darren Rosenblummemorably put it.60 Thus,if we were to take the rationale of fostering self-determination seriously, then there should arguably beno entry of a legal gender at birth, but rather at a later point when it can be based on gender identity ratherthan sex.OutlookIt remains to be seen, of course, how various courts across Europewill fare when confrontedwith non-binaryapplicants—or whether legislative reform proves to be the more fertile ground. With regard to regionalhuman rights protection, art.8 of the ECHR is certainly broad enough to accommodate claims by non-binaryapplicants.61 I have argued that the recent case-law of the European Court of Human Rights has laid thefoundations for it to move beyond (bio)logic and that, even in Goodwin, it made reference to a notion ofself-determination which showed an awareness of societal context. These elements could be built upon,although the latter would need to be rethought in such a way as to go beyond an emphasis only on allowingtrans persons to “slip quietly into the crowd” and instead also encompass a form of “affirmative designation”that actively challenges the gender binary.In light of the Strasbourg Court’s generally cautious approach to delicate subjects involving structuralchange in recent years, it may seem unlikely that it would take such a progressive stance: AsMerris Amoshas recently put it in a different context, the Court “is not willing to be the catalyst for change”.62 Its useof European consensus as an interpretive method makes things more complicated still.

At its best, legal genderrecognition for non-binary persons can foster self-determination within a larger social fabric of existence.At its worst, however, it can be used as “a way of purifying” the pre-existing categories rather thanchallenging them,65 and further contribute to the stigmatisation of trans, intersex and non-binary persons.Not every legal move beyond the gender binary is progressive: Some may be harmful.63 See J.T.

TheStory of Life Imprisonment Cases at the EuropeanCourt of Human RightsLewis Graham*Doctoral Student at the University of CambridgeInhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;Mandatory life imprisonment; Prisoners’ rights;Wholelife ordersAbstractThe imposition of life sentences upon prisoners, and their compatibility with the European Conventionon Human Rights, is a contentious legal and political issue, especially in the United Kingdom. Applicationsto the Strasbourg Court against the UK have resulted in a number of legally significant and sometimesseemingly contradictory outcomes. The Grand Chamber’s controversial 2017Hutchinson judgment seemsto come to the opposite conclusion to the landmark Vinter judgment four years earlier, which may at firstseem to demonstrate a watering-down of Convention standards. However, by looking at Hutchinson inits wider context, including its interpretation in the subsequent case of Matiošaitis v Lithuania, it seemsto be the case that, at least in the eyes of the Second Chamber, the significance of Hutchinson is largelylimited to the factual situation in the United Kingdom, and does not seem to signal a wider change ofdirection for the general Strasbourg jurisprudence.Over the last 10 years, in what has been described by one judge as a “breathtakingly fast process”,1 theEuropean Court of Human Rights has handed down a series of rulings on whether so-called “lifesentences”—imprisonment for an indefinite term without any formal opportunity for parole, release orreduction—are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention). The relevantright engaged in such cases is art.3, which prohibits the infliction of torture, inhuman or degrading treatmentin absolute terms.2 The Court has suggested that the imposition of a truly irreducible life sentence wouldconstitute such treatment because:“Even those who commit the most abhorrent and egregious acts nevertheless retain their essentialhumanity and carry within themselves the capacity to change… to deny them the experience of hope[of release] would be to deny a fundamental aspect of their humanity, and to do that would bedegrading.”3Until recently, the jurisprudence in this area has been relatively clear, with the Court handing down aset of cases which were, albeit sometimes imperfectly, generally consistent with each other. Change, if it* I would like to thank Elise Maes for comments and assistance with an earlier draft of this article.1Matiošaitis v Lithuania (App Nos 22662/13, 51059/13, 58823/13, 59692/13, 57900/13, 60115/13, 69425/13 and 72824/13), judgment of 23 May2017, concurring opinion of Judge Kūris at [3].2Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights.

This article seeks to go beyond this preliminary evaluation by assessing theHutchinsoncase in its proper context; looking at the preceding case-law, the judgment itself, and, crucially, the wayin which the case was considered in the Court’s more recent judgment of Matiosaitis v Lithuania.7 Indoing so, it will be questioned whether Hutchinson really does signify a wider change of direction in theCourt’s jurisprudence, or whether, construed retrospectively, it should be treated as an exceptional caseif applicable only to its own facts.The emergence of the jurisprudence: The Kafkaris eraIn 2008, the Grand Chamber handed down its judgment in Kafkaris v Cyprus,8 finding, for the first time,that the imposition of a whole-life sentence could violate art.3 of the Convention. The Court establishedthat where a prisoner was held without “any prospect of release”9 whatsoever, this would constitutedegrading treatment and fall foul of art.3. To remedy this possibility, the Court held that some “possibilityof review”10 allowing for the consideration of release must be in place.Whilst undoubtedly a landmark case, establishing important principles and setting the path for furtherdevelopment, Kafkaris and the cases that immediately followed it now seem relatively conservative intheir scope. For example, in subsequent cases, when invoking Kafkaris, the Court tended to synthesise itsprinciples into a singular requirement—that the sentence is “de facto and de jure reducible”.11 Generally,this did not mandate a particularly high level of scrutiny; the Court said that if a prisoner was “not deprivedof all hope” of release or reduction of their sentence, they could not rely on art.3.12 Thus prisoners wereheld not to be deprived of all such hope where their sentence was subject to a discretionary Presidential(or Vice-Presidential) power of clemency,13 nor when the possibility of parole fell on a date outside theirexpected lifespan.14On one occasion the Court found that the mere existence of “mechanisms… available”was enough to satisfy the requirements art.3, without further scrutiny.15 It would seem that the Court wasreluctant to find a breach of art.3 so long as it could identify any potential avenue for release, howeverremote or unrealistic. Perhaps because of this, the early case-law indicates no real trouble in applyingKafkaris; its application in each case was presented as relatively straightforward in practice, without theneed for any major elaboration.164Hutchinson v United Kingdom (App No.57592/08), judgment of 17 January 2017 (Grand Chamber).5Vinter v United Kingdom (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 1.

Indeed, commentators have drawn a distinction between the early case-law on theone hand and the “post-Vinter case-law”19 on the other.Vinter upheld much of the essence of the previous law; the Court repeated that in order to comply withart.3, any sentence must be “de facto and de jure reducible”,20 requiring a “possibility of review” (executiveor judicial)21 regarding a “prospect of release”.22 Article 3, therefore, was read as “requiring the reducibilityof the sentence”23 and later cases explicitly confirmed that the absence of any review mechanism wouldtherefore breach art.3.24 All of this sits easily with Kafkaris.However, the Court went further. In the case itself, and through its progeny,25 it established that in orderfor a sentence to be reducible in practice, in addition to the mere existence of a review mechanism, fouradditional criteria must be met: first, the review must meet a certain standard; secondly, the conditions ofthat review must be clear and knowable to the prisoner; thirdly, the review mechanism must be in placefrom the imposition of the sentence; and fourthly, the conditions must be clear and knowable from theimposition of the sentence.In elucidating the first requirement, a sufficient standard of review, the Court set out what a reviewmechanism must do to ensure a sentence is really “de facto and de jure reducible”. Thus, the conditionsof review must relate to the appropriateness of the sentence under relevant penological grounds.26 As theCourt put it in Öcalan (No.2), any review must assess:“whether the applicant’s continued incarceration is still justified … either because the requirementsof punishment and deterrence have not yet been entirely fulfilled or because the applicant’s continueddetention is justified by reason of his dangerousness.”27As such, post-Vinter, a review based on unrelated considerations such as ill-health or the whim of apresident will not meet such criteria.28 In addition, these conditions have to be possible to attain; prisonersmust be given “a chance, however remote, to someday regain their freedom”29 and impossible conditionsor insurmountable barriers, such as the inclusion of psychiatric requirements in a facility without relevantfacilities to identify these30 will not grant the prisoner the necessary hope of release.

The conditions themselvesmust be sufficiently clear and understandable. It must be clear “what [a prisoner] must do to be consideredfor release and under what conditions”36 and these conditions must be made known to the prisoner, to theextent that they can gain a “precise cognisance” of such requirements.37The third requirement is that the reviewmechanismmust be in place from the imposition of the sentence.In other words, if no review mechanism is in place, the breach of art.3 will be found from the veryimposition of the sentence.38 The corollary of this position is that the reviewmechanismmust exist throughall stages of the incarceration. If at any point the prisoner does not have at their disposal a possibility ofreview, art.3, it would seem, will be breached for the duration of that period, even if remedied at a laterstage.39The fourth requirement is that like the existence and effectiveness of a reviewmechanism, the necessaryclarity of the conditions of that mechanismmust also be in place from the start of the sentence.40 In Trabelsi,the Court used the language of “objective, pre-established criteria” allowing the prisoner to know theconditions of release “at the time of imposition of the sentence”.41 Like with the third requirement, a levelof clarity is continuously required. If conditions are not sufficiently clear and cognisable, art.3 will bebreached for the duration of their absence, even if clear rules are introduced later.42The Court applied these requirements stringently to the cases which came before it, including in Vinteritself. The case concerned the UK’s life sentencing practice, in which a life sentence, once imposed, wasonly able to be mitigated through the statutory power of compassionate release exercised by the HomeSecretary.43 Such a release required, as a prerequisite, something akin to terminal illness or seriousincapacitation.44 To bolster its argument, the UK government suggested that since the Home Secretaryhad a duty to act compatibly with art.3, she would not (and legally could not) interpret the compassionaterelease guidelines restrictively, and would instead adopt a broad position with regards to its use, compatiblewith the Court’s case law.45Ultimately, the Court found against the government. It stated that the strict compassionate releasegrounds, taken literally, did not meet the substantive criteria required by art.346 and the Court was31Vinter (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 1 at [120].32Bodein (App No.40014/10) at [61]-[62].33 TP and AT (App Nos 37871/14 and 73986/14) at [45].34 TP and AT (App Nos 37871/14 and 73986/14) at [48].35Vinter (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 1 at [119]-[121].

The requirements for satisfying art.3 as laid down in Vinterare different—or at least more developed—than those in Kafkaris; Judge Kūris goes so far as to suggestVinter effectively overrules the previous case-law.52 In addition, it is doubtful that certain early cases whichpassed theKafkaris threshold would survive post-Vinter. InHarakchiev, for example, the Court, in findinga violation of art.3, compared its conclusion with its previous finding to the contrary some years earlierin an almost identical factual situation. In justifying the difference, the Court pointed out that it was“decided after Kafkaris… but before Vinter” and that it “cannot adopt the same approach … in light ofthe Grand Chamber’s later ruling, in … Vinter”.53In sum, through Vinter, the Court ushered in a new understanding of what the Convention required interms of life sentences. The case was followed faithfully in a number of decisions,54 resulting in a relativelyconsistent and authoritative line of case-law.55A change in approach? Hutchinson v United KingdomAfter the Grand Chamber’s ruling in Vinter, the English Court of Appeal handed down its ruling inMcLoughlin.56 It “clarified” the operation of the Home Secretary’s statutory power of compassionaterelease, describing it as having a “wide meaning”57 beyond its literal (and non-binding) wording, allowing(and requiring) the evaluation of penological grounds for incarceration. As a result, and disagreeing withthe European Court’s conclusion in Vinter, the Court of Appeal concluded that the UK system met theart.3 criteria.58Following this, in January 2017, the Grand Chamber availed itself of a new opportunity to examine thesituation in the UK. In that case,Hutchinson v United Kingdom,59 the Court essentially accepted the Courtof Appeal’s argument, and found that the UK’s life sentences framework did not breach art.3. This, ofcourse, is the opposite conclusion to the one it reached in Vinter. But in Hutchinson, the Grand Chambercited both Vinter and Murray in its judgment60; nowhere in the judgment does it overrule or overtlydisregard any previous authority. In setting out the relevant law, the Court reiterated the post-Vinterprinciples: there must be review on legitimate penological grounds,61 these grounds of review must beclear, and crucially, must be in force and knowable “from the outset”.62 This clearly matches up with the47Vinter (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 1 at [126].48Vinter (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 1 at [125], [129].49Vinter (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 1 at [128].50Vinter (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 1 at [130].51 TP and AT (App Nos 37871/14 and 73986/14), dissenting judgment of Judge Kūris at [27].52Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13), concurring opinion of Judge Kūris at [2], [5].53Harakchiev and Tolumov (App Nos 15018/11 and 61199/12) at [252]-[253]; compare Iorgov (No.2) (App No.36295/02).

Why, then, did the majority of judges in the Grand Chambercome to the opposite conclusion to those in Vinter when the principles it espoused were identical?The answer falls to the very dubious application of the law to the facts. As regards the first criterion,the standard of review, the Court accepted and upheld the Court of Appeal’s statement of the law, acceptingthat it had “clarified” 63 the UK position and, by implication, admitted it had previously misunderstood itin Vinter. Thus, the Court agreed that the Home Secretary’s power of compassionate release, properlyunderstood, actually required her to review the penological justifications of an individual sentence. Thisis, of course, a contestable claim,64 especially as the same argument was emphatically rejected in Vinter.65Nothing had changed in practice between Vinter and Hutchinson, after all.Even more troublesome is the application of the “clarity” criterion. Thus, even if the Home Secretary’spower is construed widely enough to include a proper review of the sentence, this does not in itself satisfyart.3 unless the conditions in which this will take place are clear and knowable to the prisoner(s) servinga life sentence. The Home Secretary’s powers stem not from a clear code or legislation, but the abstractlegal requirement to act in a way that is compliant with art.3. It is not obvious how this can be sufficientlyclear and knowable to prisoners, especially given that this had been unclear to the Grand Chamber fouryears prior.66 Indeed, the only document prisoners had at their disposal indicating the possible conditionsof release—the “Lifer Manual” detailing the operation of the “compassionate grounds” for release—wasproblematic for two reasons: it was both non-binding in nature and actually set out incorrect information,67pointing exclusively to ill-health or similar circumstances as conditions of release and not anything likethe post-Vinter penological grounds which the Court accepted were nonetheless operational and crucialto satisfy art.3. This clearly seems to be out of step with the previous post-Vinter application of the principle.If the first and second Vinter requirements, that the conditions of release meet a certain substance andclarity, were dealt with poorly in Hutchinson, more worrisome still is that the third and fourthrequirements—that conditions for release should be in force and knowable from the imposition of thesentence—were barely acknowledged at all. It is unclear whether the Court deemed the “clarification” ofthe law to apply from the point of its enunciation (either when given by the Court of Appeal in 2014 oraccepted by the Grand Chamber in 2017) or whether it applied ex tunc.68Naomi Hart notes that the prisonerin question inHutchinsonwas sentenced prior to the Human Rights Act 1998 becoming coming into forcein the UK, and thus the Home Secretary would have been under no direct art.3 obligations from that sourceat the time of the imposition of the prison sentence.69 Thus even if accepted that the Home Secretary hada sufficiently substantive power to review sentences at the time of the prisoner’s imposition, it seemsimpossible to suggest that this was sufficiently clear and knowable to the prisoner from the start of theirsentence. Frustratingly, the Court glossed over this aspect of the case-law altogether. The Court explicitlystated that it would evaluate only on the position of the law as in force at the time,70 specifically goingagainst both the earlier case-law and the Court’s own statement of the law earlier in the case.71 Dissenting63Hutchinson (App No.57592/08) at [38]-[41].64 See, e.g. M. Pettigrew, “A Vinter Retreat in Europe: Returning to the issue of whole-life sentences in Strasbourg” (2017) 8(2) New Journal ofEuropean Criminal Law 128, 136. Alternatively, it might be said that the Court of Appeal’s so-called “clarification” itself had the effect of wideningthe UK position so that it is (from that point) compliant with Strasbourg standards. But this does not solve other related problems, such as the fact thatthis policy was not in force from the beginning of the sentence, violating Vinter’s third and fourth requirements—see below.65Vinter (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 1 at [126].66This point has been made forcefully by a number of commentators in the area: A.

On its face, the case seems to show a “backtracking”73 or “retreat”74from Vinter, either by applying an unusually lenient standard of assessment or declining to assess someparts of the post-Vinter framework altogether. But the wider significance of this is obfuscated by the factthat the Court places this new approach alongside a promulgation of the otherwise orthodox principles ofthe case-law. This disingenuous tactic—saying one thing and doing another—leaves the law in a state ofconfusion.75 It is unclear from the judgment alone whetherHutchinson should be seen as the Court pullingback from Vinter and adopting a new, weaker standard of review,76 or whether the Court is continuing toadhere to the Vinter standard, but just applying it sloppily to the facts of this case, perhaps mindful of theparticular political implications behind its judgment.77 Given that “the Convention is what the StrasbourgCourt says it is”,78 the Court in Hutchinson—the Grand Chamber, no less—succeeded only in making theConvention requirements inherently more uncertain.Testing the waters:MatiošaitisSo what is the status of the Vinter case-law post-Hutchinson? A first indication was given by the UK PrivyCouncil in July 2017. In Lendore,79 perhaps unsurprisingly, that court treated Hutchinson as confirminga narrower art.3 standard and bolstering the UK’s own preferred position,80 consistently withMcLoughlin.In fact, it deemed cases like Trabelsi—with its emphasis on “objective, pre-established criteria”—asrepresentative of an overzealous misapplication of the art.3 requirement, later corrected by Hutchinson.81However, more illustrative is the May 2017 Second Chamber judgment ofMatiošaitis v Lithuania.82 Inthat case, life prisoners complained that their sentences, indefinite but for the possibility of presidentialpardon, breached art.3. The Court took its usual route of setting out the case-law before applying it to thefacts. In doing so, it re-emphasised that there must exist a review mechanism allowing for the prospectof release, that review being on proper grounds; an “actual assessment of the relevant information [of]whether his or her continued imprisonment is justified on legitimate penological grounds”83 rather thanof capricious things like age and illness.84 It also emphasised that the conditions must be attainable inpractice85 and reiterated the principle that any grounds for review need to be sufficiently clear andknowable.86Murray87 was cited and paraphrased as authority for this, part of the case-law canon seeminglydiscarded in the earlier Privy Council judgment.8872Hutchinson (App No.57592/08), dissenting opinion of Judge Lopez Guerra.73A.

Whilst in the applicants’ cases their possibilityof release came in the form of a presidential pardon, the Lithuanian review system was much moreformalised than the one in, say,Kafkaris. Unlike inHutchinson, there existed a published list of qualifyingconsiderations, all of which related to the ongoing justification of the sentence, which the authoritieswould take into account when reviewing the sentence. Whilst this list was non-exhaustive, this was notin itself fatal.89 The Court accepted that the review criteria went unchanged during the tenure of theapplicants’ incarceration,90 that it was available to them and any other prisoner at any point91 and that thatthe prison authorities had also put in place certain programmes aimed at social rehabilitation of prisoners,thus enabling them to take steps towards attaining the conditions required for their release.92Despite this, the Court found that the system did notmeet Convention standards. The reviewmechanism,despite the merit of the pre-established criteria, was nonetheless found to be insufficient for prisoners “toknow what [they] must do to be considered for release and under what conditions”93 especially due to thelack of specific reasons given alongside rejections of review applications.94 The absence of such specificreasons meant that prisoners, according to the Court, would be left in “a conundrum as to what he or shemust do” to gain a pardon.95 This, coupled with the fact that applications for release were very rarelysuccessful in practice,96 caused the Court to deign the pardon system a royal prerogative of mercy ratherthan the type of sophisticated review mechanism necessary for art.3.97In addition, whilst accepting that a social rehabilitation programme was a positive initiative, the Courtstill found that the poor living conditions within the prison, particularly the number of hours life prisonersspend in total isolation, mitigated the effectiveness of any reform programme: the “deleterious effects ofsuch life prisoners’ regime must have seriously weakened the possibility of the applicants reforming”98and therefore the ability to meet the conditions for release. Taking these issues together, the Court foundthat the Lithuanian system ultimately fell beneath the high standard required to satisfy the requirementsof art.3.99The decision is strikingwhen compared directly withHutchinson for several reasons. First, inHutchinson,the Court easily accepted the claim that the Home Secretary’s discretion would be carried out in a waywhich allowed the assessment of penological grounds without any real evidence to support this; inMatiošaitis, on the other hand, the Court very carefully considered whether the required assessment ofthe required penological grounds would be carried out de facto. To this effect the frequency and operationof the pardoning mechanism in practice was not an issue in Hutchinson100 but was deemed very importantinMatiošaitis.Secondly, the mere existence of an abstract legal obligation stemming from the operation of art.3(clarified only through case-law, no less) upon the Home Secretary was enough to satisfy art.3’s clarityrequirements in Hutchinson; from this, prisoners were apparently able to know what they must do to beeligible for release.101 On the other hand, the detailed published list of considerations available to prisonerswas not enough in Matiošaitis, partially because of a lack of reasons given by the president in practice.89Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [168].90Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [166].91Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [167].92Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [178].93Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [175], [181]94Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [170], [181].95Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [176].96Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [172].97Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [173].98Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [179].99Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [181]-[182].100Hutchinson (App No.57592/08) at [53]101Hutchinson (App No.57592/08) at [63]-[64].From Vinter to Hutchinson and Back Again? 265[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsOn this point, Hutchinson simply said that to act compatibly with art.3 and the Human Rights Act, theHome Secretary would be required to “give reasons”—without analysing whether this had ever occurred.102Thirdly, the adequacy of reform programmes or the de facto possibility of achieving the conditions forrelease, so fatal a problem in theMatiošaitis judgment, were not even mentioned in Hutchinson.Fourthly, as regards toHutchinson’s most glaring omission, namely the lack of examination into whetherthe incarceration breached art.3 from the start of the sentence, Matiošaitis is less directly helpful. Theparticular case facts established that the review mechanism here had been in force, relatively unchanged,since the imposition of the sentence.103Matiošaitis does reiterate that an absence of review mechanismsfrom the beginning of a sentence would mean that a breach of art.3 “arises at the moment of the impositionof the life sentence”,104 although Hutchinson also relied on authority suggesting the same.105 Nonetheless,the more oblique nature of that statement, alongside an emphasis on the fact that art.3 was breached inone applicant’s case despite the fact that he had not yet reached the time period to make him eligible forreview,106 as well as the apparent examination of how long the review mechanism has been in force,107emphasised the temporal aspect of art.3 and strongly suggests that the requirement of a framework fromthe imposition of the sentence has not been jettisoned from the jurisprudence.To summarise, it is clear that the Court in Matiošaitis employed a more penetrating assessment ofLithuania’s prison system than theHutchinson Court did with regards to the UK. It emphasised to a muchgreater extent the reducibility of the sentence de facto and the clarity of associated criteria for this; asserteda higher standard of proof; applied greater scrutiny to the state’s claims, and, crucially, seemed to reassertthe strand of jurisprudence that art.3 requirements must be present from the start of the sentence, a facetso gravely overlooked in Hutchinson.Conclusions: the current law and the status ofVinter in a post-Hutchinson landscapeMatiošaitis, then, helps shed light on how best to construe Hutchinson, at least according to the Europeanjudges. It seems like the Court takes an approach that is more consistent with the rest of the post-Vintercase-law than the Court in Hutchinson did. How is that possible, given Hutchinson was decided by theGrand Chamber just six months prior?One possible explanation is that the Court in Matiošaitis cleverly engineered its way around theHutchinson precedent. Elements of this could be gleamed from the language of theMatiošaitis judgment;in the sections dealing with the Court’s findings, Hutchinson is mentioned just six times, compared tonine times for Vinter and fourteen times forMurray. Where Hutchinson is cited, it is used as authority forsetting out a useful overview of the case-law108 or as a citation for the use of the margin of appreciation.109It could be, then, that the Court inMatiošaitiswas doing exactly what the Court inHutchinson did—sayingone thing and doing another—by saying a case (here, Hutchinson) applies without actually applying it inpractice.But the Court need not be framed in such a duplicitous way. Rather than viewing Hutchinson asestablishing a new approach which must be artificially worked around, we can—as it seems the Court inMatiošaitis did—instead take Hutchinson as authority only as regards to its own factual situation, ratherthan for a general change in the case-law. Hutchinson can be retrospectively classified as a case of badapplication of the existing law, rather than the good application of some modification of it.102Hutchinson (App No.57592/08) at [51].103Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [167].104Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [182].105Hutchinson (App No.57592/08) at [44].106Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [182].107Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [167].108Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [156], [160].109Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [181].266 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThis sits more easily with the Court’s approval of Hutchinson in Matiošaitis; it is cited alongsideauthorities like Vinter and Harakchiev without distinction,110 and nowhere in the judgment does the Courtsuggest thatHutchinson represents any sort of departure from the previous case-law; on the contrary, fromthe outset, it is presented as an equally authoritative statement of the law, standing for exactly the sameprinciples, as the post-Vinter case ofMurray.111 In confirmingHutchinson in this way, the Court, seeminglyparadoxically, also confirms Vinter.In conclusion, the Court in Matiošaitis has shown that Hutchinson need not necessitate the discardingof the stringent post-Vinter requirements. On the contrary, Hutchinson can be treated as an orthodoxstatement of law, with the specific application of its facts an isolated example, rather than indicating ageneral trend in the case-law. However seemingly fictitious this may seem, this seems to be the way theCourt is squaring that circle. With at least two forthcoming cases in the near future,112 time will tell whetherthis narrative will prevail in the long term.110Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [160], [171], [181].111Matiošaitis (App No.22662/13) at [156].112 Tekin and Baysal v Turkey (App Nos 40192/10 and 8051/12), communicated to the Turkish government on 20 July 2015 and Viola v Italy (AppNo.77633/16), communicated to the Italian government on 30 May 2017.From Vinter to Hutchinson and Back Again? 267[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCase AnalysisThe Right to be Forgotten in Cases InvolvingCriminal ConvictionsRóisín A. Costello*Data subjects’ rights; EU law; Human rights; Internet service providers; Personal data; Public interest;Right to erasure; Spent convictionsAbstractIn NT1 and NT2 v Google and The Information Commissioner the High Court of England and Walesconsidered the applicability of the right to be forgotten to cases involving “spent” criminal convictionsunder the Data Protection Directive and in light of the decision of the Court of Justice of the EuropeanUnion (CJEU) inGoogle Spain v AEPD. The decision represents an important development in the evolvingbody precedent concerning the right to be forgotten in European law while also offering an insight intoa potential shift in attitude among common law courts towards the applicability of art.8 rights in thecontext of criminal convictions.IntroductionNT1/NT21 is perhaps the most high-profile consideration of the right to be forgotten in a common lawjurisdiction following the decision inGoogle Spain SL v Agencia Espanola de Proteccion de Datos (AEPD)2in 2014. The case, more accurately two joined cases, concerns NT1 and NT2, two businessmen previouslyconvicted of criminal offences. The claimants sought the removal by the defendant, Google, of searchresults concerning their previous convictions on the basis that the results conveyed inaccurate, out-of-dateand irrelevant information, failed to attach sufficient public interest and/or otherwise constituted anillegitimate interference with their right to be forgotten as established in Google Spain.1. The right to be forgotten in Google SpainIn Google Spain the CJEU interpreted art.14 of the Data Protection Directive 19953 and the Charter ofFundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular arts 7 and 8, as including a “right to be forgotten”.In that case a Spanish national, Mr Gonzalez, complained to the AEPD that a Google search of his namerevealed an article from Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia containing information related to the 1998sale of his property in satisfaction of social security debts.The AEPD upheld Costeja’s complaint and ordered Google to delist the results. On appeal before theSpanish High Court a preliminary referral was made to the CJEU. The referral sought clarification inrelation to three questions. First, the High Court queried the application of the Directive to Google as aUS-based company. Secondly, the Court sought clarification on the “controller” status of a search engine*LL.B.

Henceforth Google Spain.3Directive 95/46/EC.[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors268under the Directive and finally whether individuals had a “right to be forgotten” by a search engine and,if so, what the scope of such a right might be.The CJEU found the Directive did apply to Google, and that in making the information containingpersonal data available an internet service provider processed personal data and was therefore a datacontroller for the purposes of art.2 the Directive.4The Court also held a “right to be forgotten” exists under arts 7 and 8 of the Charter of FundamentalRights, which entitles individuals to request that information no longer be made available to the generalpublic by means of search engine results.5 In acknowledging the right, the Court held privacy would “asa rule” outweigh the interests of internet users in finding information, and Google’s economic interests,but noted the right was not absolute.As a result of Google Spain, data subjects may apply to the relevant national authority or court underart.12(b) and/or art.14(1)(a) of the Directive to remove links to third party publications from the resultsof internet search engines.6 Subsequent to the decision the art.29 Working Party issued Guidelines on theimplementation of the judgment. Part II of the Guidelines outline common criteria for handling complaintspursuant to Google Spain, on which Warby J drew in assessing the claims of NT1 and NT2.72. Claims in the caseIn accordance withGoogle Spain the claimants each sought delisting orders under s.14, and compensationunder s.13 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), which gives effect to the Directive.8 Additionally, theclaimants sought compensation for the tort of misuse of private information as a result of Google’s conductin continuing to return search results in the period following their complaints.9Drawing on the ruling in Google Spain as well as the art.29 guidelines, Warby J identified the mainissues in NT1/NT2 as:1. Whether the claimants were entitled to have the links complained of excluded fromGoogle’sSearch results:a. due to contents which constituted inaccurate personal data; orb. because the continued listing constituted an unjustified interference with the dataprotection or privacy rights of the complainant.2. If the claimants were entitled to have the links excluded, whether the claimants were entitledto compensation for the persistence of the listing pending the judgment.103. NT1’s caseIn the late 1980s and early 1990s NT1 was involved in a property business in connection with which hewas later convicted of a criminal conspiracy to defraud consumers and was sentenced to a term ofimprisonment. NT1was also accused, but not convicted of, a separate conspiracy connected with the sameundertaking. There was contemporaneous media coverage of these and related matters, links to whichwere made available by Google Search. NT1 was released on licence having served half his custodialsentence in the early 2000s.4Google Spain at [28], [33]-[34], [38].5Google Spain at [94], [96].6Google Spain at [81], [85], [94], [99].7Google Spain at [135], [141], [159].

Google replied in October 2014 agreeing to delist one link but declining in respectof the remaining five. NT1 requested that Google reconsider the decision, which Google declined to do.Subsequently, NT1’s solicitors repeated the request for removal, which was again refused. Consequently,NT1 brought suit leading to NT1/NT2.123.1 Abuse of process?Warby J first considered Google’s contention that NT1’s claims were an abuse of the Court’s process asthey amounted to an illegitimate attempt to circumvent the procedural and substantive law applicable toclaims in defamation.13 Warby J dismissed this argument noting that a claimant may choose to “… relyon any cause of action that arises or may arise from a given set of facts” without such choice beingconsidered an abuse.143.2 Google’s claim of journalistic exemptionWarby J also rejected Google’s contention that it should be permitted to avail of the journalism exemptioncontained in s.32 of the DPA which provided that processing for special purposes, included journalism,enjoyed exemptions from the provisions of the Act including s.14.15 Google contended that the processingwas undertaken with a view to publication for journalistic purposes and should therefore be exempted.Warby J found that although he could accept that the concept of journalism was broad, the conceptwas not so elastic as to embrace every activity connected to conveying information or opinions.16 Nor didhe find that he could agree with the narrower version of Google’s argument that the concept of journalismcovered services the purpose of which was to enable users to access third-party publisher content whichdisclosed information, opinions and ideas. The judge noted that Google’s service was a commercial oneand that Google’s own purposes were therefore separate and distinct in nature.17The judge noted, obiter, that Google’s argument, if accepted, would fail to meet the elements requiredby s.32(1)(b) and (c) as there was no evidence that Google had given consideration to the public interestin its continued publication of the URLs complained of at any time before NT1’s delisting request.18 WarbyJ thus found that the claim failed at the threshold stage and proceeded to consider the grounds on whichthe claimant might assert a successful claim for delisting pursuant to Google Spain.3.3 Could a delisting order be made?3.3.1 Were the data accurate?NT1 made six complaints of inaccuracy in relation to the use of particular words or phrases though noparticulars of the alleged inaccuracies were provided. This required the judge to carry out his own analysisfrom which he concluded that there were three complaints about the first article complained of, five aboutthe second article complained of and two about a book extract.19 In assessing whether inaccuracy was11NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [5].12NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [6].13NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [57], [58].14NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [61].15NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [95].16NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [98].17NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [98]-[101].18NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [102].19NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [79].270 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsindeed present, Warby J endorsed the understanding of the court in Charleston v New Group NewspapersLtd20 that words must be read and interpreted in context. NT1 resisted this view as imposing “artificialrestrictions” on the meaning of words or phrases used — an assertion not accepted by the Court.21Noting the inherent difficulty in assessing the truth of statements published two decades previously,particularly in light of the testimony of NT1 who under cross-examination tended to “evade, to exaggerate,[and] to obfuscate”Warby J found himself unable to accept much of the claimant’s testimony and rejectedall six complaints of inaccuracy.223.3.2 Was there an interference with NT1’s privacy or data protection rights?The CJEU in Google Spain made clear that where evidence exists that the availability of a search resultis causing prejudice to the claimant’s rights this would be a strong factor in favour of delisting. TheWorking Party in its discussion cited an example of undue prejudice in which a foolish misdemeanor, nolonger the subject of public debate and with no wider public interest, would lead to a situation in whichthe disproportionately negative impact on the privacy of the data subject would merit delisting.23In analysing the remaining information, Warby J noted the claimant’s allegation that the continuedavailability of the information had infringed his right to privacy and caused substantial damage and distressto him as a result of his subsequent treatment as a “pariah” in his business and social life, as well as makinghim the subject of threats in public places. NT1 also alleged that there had been disruption to his familylife.24Warby J noted that while there was some information in the articles which related to the complainant’shealth, information which was prima facie private, the information was trivial, historic and made in publicin the course of proceedings such that it was not intrinsically private.25In assessing the remainder of the claims, Warby J noted NT1’s case suffered from a lack of causationin establishing whether the harm would have resulted irrespective of Google’s actions.26 In particular, thejudge noted that the only evidence of threats dated from incidents during NT1’s term in prison and shortlyafter his release and could not be attributed to any illegitimate processing by Google.27 Equally, the judgefound he could not attribute the only specific incident recounted by NT1 in which a business deal washindered by the counterparty’s knowledge of his conviction to the behavior of Google as it occurred beforeNT1’s conviction became spent.28In relation to the impacts on the claimant’s family and private life, the judge noted that the claims werelittle more than a reiteration of the pleaded case with no specific incidents or detail as to the nature of theimpact with the result that the evidence of harm or prejudice to NT1’s rights to privacy and data protectionwas insufficient to add any great weight in favour of delisting.293.3.3 Balancing individual rights and the public interestIn seeking to balance NT1’s rights as against the public interest, Warby J noted that the Working PartyGuidelines identified the overall purpose of its criteria as assessing whether the information is relevantaccording to the interest of the general public. The Guidelines noted that whether the claimant was still20Charleston v New Group Newspapers Ltd [1995] 2 A.C. 65.21NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [83], [142].22NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [92]-[94].23NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [147].24NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [149].25NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [140], [145], [146].26NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [151].27NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [152].28NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [153].29NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [154], [155].Case Analysis 271[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsengaged in the same professional activity and was a public individual would be particularly relevant insuch an assessment.Google contended that NT1’s business career since his release from prison, combined with misleadingclaims made online,30 supported their contention that the information should remain available to act ascorrection to the narrative promoted by the claimant.31 In response, NT1 contended that the right to receiveinformation is inherently less weighty than the right to impart it.32Warby J found no support for NT1’s contention at law or in the argument presented33 and went on tonote that NT1’s post-prison career included lending money to businesses and individuals—a pursuit whichthe judge found it reasonable to assume was funded by the proceeds of the fraud perpetrated on consumerswho had moved abroad prior to the claimant’s arrest and imprisonment.34 Warby J further noted that thescale of NT1’s fraud was far from negligible and that the claimant’s portrayal of himself online and onsocial media were aimed at the public and were known to be false and misleading.35The judge then turned to examine whether, as a result of NT1’s role in public life, the informationcomplained of constituted genuinely private information. TheWorking Party Guidelines provide that therewill be a stronger argument against delisting where the information concerns a public figure, or an individualplaying a role in public life.36 The judge noted the Working Party’s definitions of “public figures”, whichincludes individuals who have a degree of media exposure and “playing a role in public life” which theWorking Party suggests should be guided by whether the public have an interest in information whichmay protect them against improper public or professional conduct.37The judge noted that though NT1’s role in public life was no longer prominent it subsisted, in light ofwhich, and combined with the claimant’s misrepresentation of his reputation online, Warby J found thatNT1 was a public figure and that the Working Party Guidelines favoured the continued availability of theinformation.383.3.4 Criminal nature of the offenceFinally, Warby J considered the criminal nature of the offence involved. The judge noted that the contextin which the information was published was that of substantially fair and accurate reporting in nationalmedia of public legal proceedings and that such reporting was both a natural and foreseeable result of thedishonest criminal conduct of the claimant.39Warby J dismissed NT1’s claim that he had a legitimate expectation of rehabilitation after leavingprison noting that, had the law remained as it stood when NT1 was released, his sentence would neverhave become spent, only becoming entitled to such an expectation in 2014 following the revision of thelaw.40 The issue to be addressed was therefore whether the fact that the conviction was spent was sufficientlyweighty to mandate an order for delisting.41This section of Warby J’s consideration is perhaps where the impact of Google Spain at a nationallevel becomes most obvious—requiring the Court to reconcile, in light of legislation passed 25 yearsbefore the advent of the internet, the right to rehabilitation as an aspect of the law of personal privacy with30 Subsequent to his release and resuming his business NT1 also caused online postings to be made about his business experience and reputationwhich promoted the idea of NT1 as a man of “unblemished integrity”.

Thejudge went on to note that despite this there may come a time, determined by Parliament, when a convictionbecomes spent and an individual’s art.8 rights are engaged.However, Warby J found that it did not follow from this that the individual’s art.8 rights are ofpreponderant weight and observed that there is no bright line in art.8 jurisprudence on when the articlewill outweigh other rights.43 The judge found that NT1’s case lay at the very outer limit of those sentenceswhich could become spent under the statutory scheme, and indeed would never have become spent underthe law as it stood from 1974 to 2014 in accordance with the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.44Moreover, Warby J remarked that the comments of the sentencing judge clearly indicated the claimant’ssentence would have been longer but for his ill-health.Warby J concluded that NT1’s art.8 rights were not engaged due to his conduct subsequent to hisrelease, the nature of his offence, including the length of his sentence, and his failure to proffer detailedevidence of the impact on his rights which was attributable to the continued availability of the searchresults.45The judge also emphasised that while it was of limited relevance to those with whomNT1 had businessdealings to learn of his conviction, there were people who had a legitimate interest in such knowledge,still more so in circumstances where the claimant’s own postings online had misrepresented his businessrecord and reputation.46 Warby J thus found that retention would serve the legitimate purpose of correctingthe record in circumstances where it was not clear the relevance of the information had been exhausted.473.4 Decision and remediesWarby J thus dismissed NT1’s claims of inaccuracy and also dismissed the remainder of the delistingclaim on the basis that the claimant had failed to satisfy the criteria established in Google Spain. WarbyJ further found that the claim for misuse of private information failed, having found Google’s processingto be justified, and that there was thus no basis for the award of compensation.484. NT2’s caseIn the early 2000s NT2 was involved in a firm which was subject to public campaign of opposition dueto its environmental practices. Criminal and nuisance acts were committed against the firm and NT2received death threats. In response, the firm hired private investigators to seek to identify those responsible.In his role within the firm NT2 authorised these investigators to use surveillance methods which he knewto be illegal.49NT2 pleaded guilty at an early stage and was sentenced to sixth months’ imprisonment of a potentialmaximum sentence of 12 months, which was reduced in light of his guilty plea and the presence of personalmitigating factors.50 Both the conviction and sentence were reported in national and local media. NT2served six weeks in custody and was released in 2008. As with NT1 the conviction became “spent” but42NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [165]-[166].43NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [166].44Subsequently the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO) the rehabilitation period after which sentences becamespent was reduced.45NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [167].46NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [168].47NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [168], [169].48NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [56].49NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [179]-[181].50NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [182].Case Analysis 273[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthe original news reports remained available. Unlike NT1, however, NT2’s conviction and sentence werealso mentioned in more recent publications, two of which were reports of interviews given by NT2.NT2 requested the removal of eight links by Google in April 2015. 51 Google declined on the groundsthat the reports related “to matters of substantial public interest regarding [NT2’s] professional life”.52NT2 subsequently issued proceedings seeking relief in respect of the eight links as well as three furtherlinks two of which were subsequently removed voluntarily.53At the outset Warby J noted that Google’s claims of abuse of process and journalistic exemption alsofailed in respect of NT2.544.1 Could a delisting order be made?4.1.1 Were the data accurate?The claimant alleged inaccuracy in respect of one of the articles only. NT2 alleged the piece was inaccurateas it suggested, incorrectly, that he had gained financially from his crime.55 Google accepted that the itemconveyed serious imputations against suspected criminals but argued that those portions of the piece couldnot have been understood as referring to NT2.56 Warby J, however, found that the article was inaccurateas it gave the misleading impression that the claimant’s criminality did result in financial gain, by describingand comparing the claimant’s case to those involving instances in which individuals had received financialgain as a result of criminal activity.57 The judge thus made the appropriate delisting order.584.1.2 Was there an interference with NT2’s privacy or data protection rights?As with NT1, NT2 claimed the availability of the links complained of had resulted in a profound impacton his business and personal life. Warby J noted that, as with NT1, much of the emphasis was on theimpact of the listings on the claimants’ business. In NT2’s case the impacts were a subsequent disadvantageor difficulty in securing banking facilities and business opportunities. The judge noted that though theinformation given exceeded that provided by NT1, the claims remained vague and lacked detail.594.1.3 Balancing individual rights and the public interestIn considering whether NT2 constituted a public figure, the judge found that while the complainant didnot enjoy the status as a public figure which he previously had, he remained a public figure in a reducedbut not wholly eliminated capacity.60Warby J continued, noting that the claimant was no longer involved with the industry of which he hadbeen a part at the time of the crime nor had he misrepresented his reputation or history as NT1 had. Googlemaintained that despite this the information in NT2’s case remained relevant and that the self-promotionengaged in by NT2 supported the claim that the articles complained of should remain available to correctthe record.Google drew, specifically, on two press interviews given by NT2 subsequent to his conviction becomingspent, as well as a personal website and online news reports which promoted NT2 as a successful51NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [7].52NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [8].53NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [8], [174].54NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [177].55NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [212], [187].56NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [188].57NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [190].58NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [191].59NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [216]-[218].60NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [210].274 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsbusinessman with experience in finance and environmental matters. Warby J found that the interviewsindicated NT2 was not seeking to hide his crime from the public and that neither the publications nor theinterviews made claims which were inconsistent with the evidence against him or “extravagantly beyondwhat might have been justified by reference to the principle of rehabilitation”.614.1.4 The criminal nature of the offenceThe most significant point on which the cases of NT1 and NT2 differed, in the opinion of the judge, wasthe nature of the criminal offences involved. As with NT1 the judge noted that the reporting at issue wasa natural, probable and foreseeable consequence of the complainant’s conviction and that, with the exceptionof the article delisted for inaccuracy, the reporting was fair and accurate in the context of the remainingpublications.62Warby J noted that while a criminal offence was at issue in both cases, distinctions were apparentbetween the claimants’ cases. The first was that NT2’s conviction was always due to become spent—bothunder the 1974 Act as well as following its 2014 revision with the result that NT2 had a legitimateexpectation of rehabilitation from the time of his release.63 The judge also noted that, unlike NT1, NT2provided credible evidence in support of his case that the availability of the search results had causeddamage to his business. In a private context the judge noted that the presence of a young family in NT2’scase strengthened his case for the existence of an interference with his art.8 rights.64The judge also emphasised the nature of NT2’s conviction as a significant factor in deciding whetherthe information had prejudiced his rights under arts 7 and 8. Warby J noted that the crime of invasion ofprivacy was not a crime of dishonesty, as had been the case with NT1 and that NT2 had acted in goodfaith believing his actions were necessary in light of his targeting by malign actors. The judge placedparticular emphasis on the fact that NT2 did not contest the charges, had pleaded guilty at an early stageand showed an awareness and remorse for his crime which Warby J deemed to be genuine.65 Finally, thejudge repeatedly noted that the relevance of the crime to potential customers was “slender to non-existent”and that there was no suggestion the wrongdoing would be repeated.664.2 Decision and remediesBased on these factors Warby J noted that the information complained of had become irrelevant and ofinsufficient, legitimate interest to users to justify its continued availability.67 The judge found the informationhad been public at the time of publication but that that position had changed over time and that art.8 wasengaged, in particular by the presence of a young family in NT2’s life.68While the judge noted the interference with the claimant’s art.8 rights was not grave he found theimpact on NT2’s rights was nevertheless sufficient to require justification based on relevance whichGoogle had been unable to provide.69Therefore, Warby J, in addition to upholding the complaint of inaccuracy, found there had been amisuse of private information in as much as the claimant had established a reasonable expectation ofprivacy as a result of: the fact that his sentence would always have become spent; the change in thecharacter of the information over time; and the engagement of his art.8 rights. As a result the judge issued61NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [205], [206].62NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [219]-[220].63NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [222].64NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [221]-[222].65NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [222].66NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [203], [204], [222].67NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [223].68NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [224].69NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [226].Case Analysis 275[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsan order for delisting in respect of the remaining articles.70 However, the Court found Google had takenreasonable care, and that as a result the claimant was not entitled to either compensation or damages.715. Analysis of the judgmentThe decision inNT1/NT2 is particularly relevant given the traditional hostility of common law jurisdictionsto rights of privacy that extend to historical criminal convictions.72 Common law jurisdictions havetraditionally privileged principles of open justice in contrast to the approach of many civil law jurisdictionswhich, in general, opposes punitive shaming and presumes criminal records to be confidential.73 The civillaw approach is reflected in the 1981 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals withregard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data as well as the Data Protection Directive art.8(5) and theGeneral Data Protection Regulation.74NT1/ NT2 thus represents an explicit departure from traditional common law attitudes toward criminalhistories. However, several aspects of the judgment deserve particular attention in relation to the potentialof the decision to act as a useful precedent.The most evident issue is that the judgment has been anonymised and referred to the convictions andcircumstances of the claimants’ crimes as well as the impact on their private and family lives in a mannersufficiently broad so as to preserve their identities. The emphasis placed by Warby J on the personaldispositions of both claimants and the absence of detailed evidence presented in the case make thisproblematic. The result is a judgment whose criteria are largely subjective, and whose findings are renderedin broad strokes, lacking a nuanced analysis of the specific details, or levels of detail, futile to futureclaimants.In particular, the anonymisation poses challenges in distinguishing the criteria which will be consideredsufficient to trigger a “grave” interference with arts 7 and 8, though this may also be attributable to thepaucity of evidence offered by the claimants themselves. As a result of the anonymisation it is difficultto determine accurately which, if either, is the case.In relation to the criteria associated with a criminal offence which favour delisting, Warby J centredhis analysis on the guidelines established by the Working Party, of which the presence of criminalconvictions is an aspect. However, his judgment neglected to establish a more specific set of criteria.Based on Warby J’s remarks, it appears that the length of the sentence and its relative placing on thescale of offences which may become “spent” will be relevant. However, Warby J specifically noted thata spent conviction would not be determinative and would be merely “weighty” in balancing individualrights and the public interest. There was no clarification of whether convictions which were not, and wouldnot, become spent would be amenable to delisting though given the differentiation between NT1 and NT2based in part on the severity of their sentences such convictions would implicitly not be amenable todelisting.The judge also referred in his decision regarding NT2 to the fact that the crime at issue was not one of“dishonesty”. However, there was no discussion of whether the differentiation as between a crime ofdishonesty and other crimes was a determinative factor. Again, the implication from the judgment is that,as with a spent conviction, this will be a consideration rather than determinative factor.70NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [224]-[226].71NT1 and NT2 [2018] EWHC 799 (QB) at [227], [228], [230].72For a comparative analysis as between a common law and civil law jurisdiction see J.B.

The resultis an unclearmélange of a public interest test with a categorical sliding scale of offences defined in relationto their relative degrees of deception. The implication that a conviction for a violent crime committedwithout deception would bemore favourably treated than a non-violent offence of dishonesty is problematicon a public policy basis.Moreover, as criminal acts generally involve an individual recklessly or knowingly breaking the law,invariably in a manner which seeks to avoid detection, the merits of using honesty as a distinguishingmetric is of questionable merit.The most substantively considered andmost portable aspect of the judgment is its treatment of self-help.Both claimants, on the advice of reputation management professionals, had generated content with theexpress aim of influencing Google’s list of returned results prior to the decision in Google Spain. Indifferentiating between the legitimate self-help employed by NT2 and the misleading informationpromulgated by NT1, Warby J clarified that self-help can be counted against claimants only where it isdeliberately misleading.ConclusionThe decision in NT1/NT2 is somewhat confined to its facts due to the emphasis placed by the judge on asubjective assessment of credibility and remorse. Despite this, the case offers a tentative first step towardsclarifying the criteria for a delisting order in cases involving criminal convictions and offers a significantendorsement of the right to be forgotten in such cases.The decision in relation to NT1 may be clarified on appeal. However, the trial judge’s comments onthe claimant’s credibility and the paucity of evidence offered would seem to make the likelihood of asuccessful appeal remote. Furthermore, the High Court case has generated significant media attention andan appeal to the Supreme Court would likely generate still more. In such circumstances were the reportingrestrictions to be lifted following an appeal NT1’s conviction would, somewhat ironically, be more publicthan if had he chosen not to pursue a delisting, as indeed was the case with the original appellant inGoogleSpain.Case Analysis 277[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCase and CommentSelected decisions from the European Court of Human Rights for Januaryand February 2018Editor: Dr Sofia Galani, Lecturer in Law, Human Rights Implementation Centre, University of BristolLaw School.Contributors: Richard Costidell, Pablo Fuenzalida, Christopher Gray, Kaj Hadad, Lucie Laffont,Jordan Owen, Alice Venn, Jennyfer Vervisch (University of Bristol).Note on Court judgments: European Court judgments can be delivered by a Grand Chamber of 17judges, a chamber of seven judges from one of the Court’s five sections or, where the issue is already thesubject of well-established case-law, by a committee of three judges from one of the sections. GrandChamber and committee judgments are final. Within three months of a chamber judgment either theapplicant or the respondent government may request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber. Achamber judgment becomes final when the parties confirm that they will not seek a referral to the GrandChamber, when three months have elapsed from the date of the chamber judgment without any requestfor a referral, or, if there has been such a request, when a panel of the Grand Chamber rejects it.Protection of whistleblowersWhistleblowing—dismissal—reinstatement—public interest—freedom of expression—freedom to impartinformation—art.10—new issues for adjudication—compliance with the Court’s decisions—art.46Dismissal; Freedom of expression; Journalists; Moldova; WhistleblowingGuja v Republic of Moldova (No.2) (Application No.1085/10)European Court of Human Rights (Second Section): Judgment of 27 February 2018FactsThe applicant, Mr Iacob Guja, aMoldovan national and journalist formerly employed as Head of the PressDepartment in the Prosecutor General’s Office, alleged that his art.10 right to freedom of expression hadbeen violated as a result of his dismissal in contravention of the previous judgment of the European Courtof Human Rights (the Court) delivered on 12 February 2008. Mr Guja was initially dismissed in 2003 forsharing material detailing the attempts of government officials to influence the prosecutorial decisions incases concerning the alleged misconduct of police officers with two newspapers, an act the ProsecutorGeneral found to be in contravention of departmental regulations.The applicant challenged his dismissal before the domestic courts, arguing that the information hadbeen shared with the aim of tackling corruption. The domestic courts, however, upheld the decision ofthe Prosecutor General’s Office to dismiss on the basis of the applicant’s failure to adequately consultwith colleagues internally and to comply with the duty of confidentiality his role entailed. Lodging aninitial complaint before the Court, the applicant argued that his art.10 right to freedom of expression hadbeen violated. The Court in its judgment of 12 February 2008 held that the dismissal had amounted to a[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors278violation of art.10. The Court held that although themeasure was prescribed by law and pursued a legitimateaim within the meaning of art.10(2), the measure was incommensurate with what is “necessary in ademocratic society”. The Court referred to the applicant’s lack of alternative means of disclosing theinformation and to the public interest in being informed of wrongdoing within the Prosecutor General’sOffice. Following the judgment, the Supreme Court of Moldova ordered the applicant’s reinstatement andon 5 June 2008 he was ordered reinstated by the Prosecutor General.The applicant alleged that he was not given access to an office or allocated tasks. On 16 June 2008, theapplicant was subsequently presented with a dismissal order subject to the Public Service Act which hadbeen granted the requisite trade union approval. The applicant’s further challenges before the domesticcourts were unsuccessful, the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court citing the reinstatement of the applicantfollowing the 2008 judgment and the compliance with domestic law requirements of the ProsecutorGeneral’s Office in ordering his subsequent dismissal. Lodging a complaint before the Court, the applicantalleged that the actions of his employers in ordering his dismissal for a second time and in failing to complywith the Court’s 2008 judgment, constituted a new breach of his art.10 right.Held(1) The application was admissible (unanimous).In its consideration of admissibility, the Court took the opportunity to clarify the consequencesof a failure by High Contracting Parties to comply with judgments of the Court. In accordancewith art.46 of the Convention, it was affirmed that respondent states are under an obligationto abide by the Court’s judgments and to adopt any necessary measures with the aim ofproviding full restitution to applicants. Although the Committee of Ministers remainsprimarily responsible for evaluating the compliance of High Contracting Parties withjudgments of the Court under art.46, it was affirmed that this shall not prevent the Courtfrom choosing to examine applications relating to the state’s execution measures for aprevious judgment, if new information on an issue not previously adjudicated upon ispresented. The existence of new issues for consideration by the Court are to be determinedcontextually on a case-by-case basis. In the present circumstances, the Court held that theapplication related to new proceedings before the domestic courts and to the dismissal ofthe applicant for a second time, matters which were not addressed in its previous judgmentand were therefore eligible for consideration. The complaint was further held not to bemanifestly ill-founded for the purposes of art.35(3) or to be inadmissible on any othergrounds.(2) There had been a violation of art.10 (unanimous).The Court held that the central issue to be determined was whether the second dismissal ofthe applicant was motivated by his decision to share information with the press in 2003 andtherefore amounted to a new interference with his right to freedom of expression. The Court,in rejecting the argument of the respondent government that the second dismissal wasunrelated to the applicant’s former actions, cited the fact that the applicant was the firstemployee to be dismissed pursuant to the Public Service Act in the period 2003–2008 whichhad seen the appointment of two new Prosecutors General. It was further noted that the tradeunions’ approval to dismiss the applicant had been sought on the day of the applicant’sreinstatement, and that the respondent government had failed to present evidence in supportof their rebuttal of the applicant’s claims that he had not been allocated an access badge, anoffice or any tasks upon his return.In relation to the domestic proceedings, the Court underlined the failure of the ProsecutorGeneral to offer the same justification for the dismissal of the applicant offered by theCase and Comment 279[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsrespondent government in its submissions. Consequently, the Court concluded that therewere “sufficiently strong grounds” to infer that the applicant’s dismissal in 2008 had notbeen because of a reshuffle in the wake of the appointment of a new Prosecutor General,but rather could be viewed as a retaliatory response to his actions in 2003. The failure ofthe domestic courts to consider the applicant’s allegations that he had been effectivelyexcluded from work on his reinstatement and any further interference with his art.10 rightwas cited as a crucial factor influencing the Court’s conclusion. Accordingly, it was heldthat the actions of the respondent authorities amounted to an interference with the applicant’sart.10 freedom to impart information, and that this interference could not be justified asnecessary in a democratic society.(3) The respondent state was obliged to pay €10,000 in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniarydamages in addition to any tax due, within a period of three months (unanimous).(4) The respondent state was obliged to pay €1,500 in respect of costs and expenses in additionto any tax due, within a period of three months (unanimous).(5) The remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction was dismissed (unanimous).Cases consideredBochan v Ukraine (2015) 61 E.H.R.R. 14Egmez v Cyprus (No.2) (App. No. 12214/07), judgment of 18 September 2012Emre v Switzerland (2014) 59 E.H.R.R. 11Guja v Moldova (2011) 53 E.H.R.R. 16Liu v Russia (No.2) (App. No. 29157/09), judgment of 26 July 2011Marckx v Belgium (1979–80) 2 E.H.R.R. 330Nikolov v Bulgaria (App. No.38884/97), judgment of 30 January 2003Piersack v Belgium (1985) 7 E.H.R.R.

TheCourt’s previous judgment in Guja v Moldova delivered in 2008 served to develop key points of law inrelation to the protection of whistle-blowers, in particular on the balancing of duties of discretion held bypublic servants and the public interest in the disclosure of information. Public servants disclosinginformation in the public interest were held to be subject to duties to report wherever possible in the firstinstance to superiors, to verify the authenticity of the information, and to act in good faith. Meanwhile, itwas held that the Court should balance the public interest in disclosure against any damage suffered bythe authority in question prior to making a determination on the permissibility of any interference withan applicant’s right to freedom of expression. These key points of law were subsequently collated, alongwith those emerging in the case-law that followed, by the Committee of Ministers in the form ofRecommendation CM/Rec (2014) on the protection of whistle-blowers. The Court took the opportunityin the present case to reaffirm its previous reasoning, yet it was simultaneously careful to stress thelimitations on its jurisdiction in relation to art.46 and questions surrounding the execution of its previousjudgments which fall within the remit of the High Contracting Parties and the Committee of Ministers.The decision of the Court on admissibility therefore raised some interesting questions, particularly inlight of the execution procedure for the Court’s 2008 judgment before the Committee of Ministers which280 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsremained ongoing when the judgment was issued. The Court can be seen to have trodden a careful linebetween the defence of its competence to examine new issues arising in relation to a previous case on theone hand, and acknowledging the limitations upon its jurisdiction, notably in the responsibility of theCommittee of Ministers for monitoring the execution of judgments, and the discretion enjoyed by statesto decide upon their own compliance measures on the other. It is clear that the Court wished to retain abroad discretion in this respect, holding that the existence of a new issue engaging its competence willdepend upon the circumstances in question and be decided on a case-by-case basis.The strongly worded reasoning of the Court on the merits raises similar points of contention. For thepurposes of establishing whether the applicant’s second dismissal amounted to an unjustified interferencewith his freedom to impart information under art.10, the Court chose to focus exclusively upon the secondground capable of justifying an interference under art.10(2), namely that of being “necessary in a democraticsociety”, deeming it unnecessary to consider whether the interference was prescribed by law or in pursuitof a legitimate aim. The conclusions drawn with respect to the actions of the respondent state authoritieswere heavily critical, the Court arguing that “the Prosecutor General did not even attempt to maintain theimpression of a simple labour dispute” and that the actions taken made it “obvious” that the applicant wasnot welcome to return to work. The findings were similarly critical of the domestic courts which it washeld had “paid no attention at all” to the applicant’s allegations regarding his reinstatement and therebyfailed in their duties to examine the protection afforded under art.10.Once again, however, the strong wording of the reasoning was tempered by a recognition of the discretionof the domestic authorities with respect to labour procedures, the Court stressing that “the obligation toreinstate does not preclude future dismissal on another, justified ground”. This case evidences the difficultiesfaced by the judges in balancing the interests of the domestic authorities and jurisdictional boundarieswith the Court’s own desire to secure comprehensive and effective protection for the art.10 rights ofwhistle-blowers, an issue which in the intervening period since its 2008 judgment, has been the subjectof increasing international attention, including by the Council of Europe’s own Committee of Ministers.Hidden camerasHidden recordings—public figures—public interest—legitimate expectation to privacy—responsiblejournalism—right to information—freedom of expression—art.10—length of proceedings—sanctions—right to a fair trial—art.6Broadcasters; Freedom of expression; Greece; Public figures; Right to respect for private and familylife; Surveillance; Surveillance camerasAlpha Doryforiki Tileorasi Anonymi Etairia v Greece (Application No.72562/10)European Court of Human Rights (First section): Judgment of 28 February 2018FactsThe present case concerns a conflict of rights between the right to freedom of expression and the right toprivacy, regarding the use of hidden recordings and broadcasting of the images obtained through thosemeans with respect to a politician’s private behaviour.The applicant is a Greek company owner of the television channel ALPHA. The conflict regarded thebroadcasting of three videos recorded using hidden cameras. The first video showed amember of parliament,AC, and chairman of the inter-party committee on electronic gambling, entering a gambling arcade andCase and Comment 281[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsplaying on two machines. The second video showed AC meeting with associates of the television hostand watching the first video. The third video showed the discussion between AC and the host of theprogramme held at the latter’s office. In this video AC requested the said host to present the footage toimply that he was first-hand experiencing with gambling to understand the problem as the chair of theparliamentary committee, in exchange for which he would attend their programme as an interviewee.The National Council of Radio and Television sanctioned the company for the use of hiddencameras—which this public body estimated should be restricted to situations such as national security orcrime prevention—and the entrapment of AC. This decision was confirmed afterwards by the Ministerof Press and Media.The applicant company lodged an application for annulment before the Supreme Administrative Court.In this court’s assessment, a legitimate use of hidden cameras refers to reporting on specific news whosemain source was the image of a specific person recorded by secret means, whereas an illegitimate use ofthose means refers to the broadcasting of the relevant and secretly recorded image as, in principle it violatesa person’s right to her or his own image. Therefore, the sanction had been imposed exclusively for thebroadcasting of the images and not because of the transmission of the news about those images. Aconcurring opinion considered that the use of hidden cameras violated the right to dignity, as AC wasreduced to an instrument for the applicant’s goals. The dissenting opinions contended the distinction usedby the majority, as in the case of television broadcasting the image went together with broadcasting thenews itself. Furthermore, AC, as a public figure, does not enjoy the same absolute level of protection ofhis right to his own image, particularly as the images were obtained in public spaces and it was of publicinterest to inform about them considering the role that ACwas expected to play with respect to prospectivelegislation on electronic gambling. The Supreme Court dismissed the application for annulment by amajority of its members, therefore exhausting domestic remedies.The applicant alleged that the sanctions imposed by the domestic authorities violated its rights asguaranteed in art.10 of the Convention. Those sanctions consisted of €100,000 for each of the two televisionshows during which the videos were shown and the obligation to broadcast on three days in a row on itsmain news show the content of that decision. Additionally, the applicant claimed there was a violation ofart.6 of the Convention—the right to have a fair trial within a reasonable time—considering the excessivelength of the procedures which led to the imposition of the sanctions and its dismissed application forannulment before the Supreme Administrative Court, respectively, as they prolonged for seven years andtwo months.Held(1) The Court declared the complaint admissible (unanimous).(2) There had been a violation of art.10 with respect to the first video (unanimous).The Court initiated its assessment using two main approaches to evaluate if the Greekauthorities had properly balanced the rights to freedom of expression and privacy. The firstregards its institutional role within the Convention’s system, where for these matters itssubsidiary role consists of a supervisory function for reviewing if the balancing processfollowed by the national authorities has been compatible with the provision of the Convention.If the domestic authorities have not considered one of the fundamental rights at stake, theCourt would be less deferential, adopting a narrower margin of appreciation over theirdecision. On the contrary, if the national authorities have followed the criteria set by theCourt, only if there exist strong reasons the Court could intervene substituting the domesticauthorities’ view. The second approach regards the actual criteria set in previous case-lawfor balancing these competing rights: the contribution to a debate of public interest; thedegree to which the person affected is well-known; the subject of the news report; the method282 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsof obtaining the information and its veracity; the prior conduct of the person concerned; thecontent, form and consequences of the publication; and the severity of the sanction imposed.In its assessment of the first and second criteria, the Court retorted to a highly deferentialapproach, as the domestic decisions did not explicitly consider them. Accordingly, the Courtconsiders that, by applying the relevant legislation as well as from the conclusion that newswhose source was the videos could be legitimately broadcast, the domestic authorities haveimplicitly addressed that the report concerned a matter of public interest and the public figurestatus of AC. Furthermore, the Court agrees with the distinction between news broadcastingand broadcasting of the videos itself as one grounded on the Court’s previous case-law “sincethe audio-visual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than theprint media”. As regards the criteria of prior conduct of the person concerned, the Courtconcurred with the absence of comment from both the authorities and the parties especiallyas it has previously upheld that toleration or accommodation with regard to publications onan individual’s private life does not deprive her or him of the right to privacy. With respectto the content, form and consequences of the broadcast, the Court acknowledges that theyhave not been contested by the parties and that the removal of AC from the parliamentarygroup has been a serious consequence which affected him directly.The Court also considered that the domestic authorities failed to take into account thecircumstances under which it was obtained. The first video, though it was filmed usinghidden cameras, was recorded in public premises and, considering the public status of AC,he could not have the same legitimate expectation of privacy regarding the monitoring ofhis conduct and to have it recorded on camera. Therefore, the domestic authorities did notstrike a reasonable balance of proportionality between the restrictions on the applicant’sfreedom of expression and the legitimate aim pursued.(3) There had been no violation of art.10 with respect to the second and third video (unanimous).With respect to the second and third video, the Court argued that AC was entitled to havea legitimate expectation of privacy as he entered private spaces and to not have hisconversations recordedwithout his consent. The Court links this feature with its understandingof the concept of responsible journalism, to determine whether the journalists involved inthis case behaved in good faith. This standard of conduct governs the contents of theinformation which is collected and/or disseminated by journalistic means as well as thelawfulness of the conduct of the journalists involved. In this second scenario, the locus ofthe second and third videos, the journalists did not act in good faith as the aim of theserecordings was to exercise pressure on AC. This was a decisive element in the domesticauthorities’ consideration, as they had labelled a situation of entrapment. As professionals,argues the Court, they should have been aware of the relevant law governing theirperformance provision, as with their behaviour they were breaching both professional ethicsand criminal law. To justify its position, the Court distinguished this case from two previousones. Alpha Doryforiki is distinguishable from Haldimann as the applicant did not makeany effort to compensate for the intrusion into AC’s private life—inHaldimann the applicantshad taken measures to protect the subject’s image. With respect to Radio Twist, where theillegal recording in question was undertaken by third parties, in the present case theapplicants’ employees did the recording.(4) There had been a violation of art.6 with respect to the length of the domestic procedures(unanimous).The Court reasoned that length of the proceedings was excessive, particularly as only forone instance the proceedings lasted more than seven years.Case and Comment 283[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors(5) The Court awarded €33,000 in pecuniary damages as the applicant had paid only half of thefine and only the first video was found a violation of art.10 of the Convention.With respect to the severity of the sanction, the Court agreed that, though significant, it wasnot disproportionate, and that the domestic authorities have evaluated several factors beforedeciding on the appropriate sanction: the gravity of the offence, the number of viewers, thesize of the investment that the applicant had made and the fact that the company had beenrepeatedly sanctioned for the same offence in the past. In addition to the previous factors,the Court concluded that the sanctions have not had a deterrent effect on the press reportingon matters of public interest, particularly as they were not imposed on the journalists but onthe applicant company.(6) The Court awarded €7,000 in non-pecuniary damages to the applicant for the harm causedto the company’s reputation and prolonged uncertainty.Cases consideredAxel Springer AG v Germany (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 6Haldimann v Switzerland (App. No.21830/09), judgment of 24 February 2015Handyside v United Kingdom (1976) 1 E.H.R.R. 737Jersild v Denmark (1995) 19 E.H.R.R. 1Radio Twist, AS v Slovakia (App. No.62202/00), judgment of 19 December 2006Stoll v Switzerland (2007) 44 E.H.R.R. 53Von Hannover v Germany (No.2) (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 15CommentaryAlpha Doryforiki is illustrative of the delicate task that requires balancing a conflict between the rights tofreedom of expression of the press in a democratic society to report on political actors’ private behaviourwhich may affect their official duties, and the latter’s right to privacy. The Court attempts to strike abalance between both rights by attending to the location where the footage was obtained. By proceedingthis way, the Court safeguards that public interest information such as that concerning public authority’spotential contradicting behaviour between their public stances and their private conduct are imparted tothe public, reducing the risk of further exploitation of that situation through clandestine recordings obtainedin private spaces. Nonetheless, the legitimacy of covert filming is still an open issue, as the Court doesnot state a general opinion regarding the adequacy of these journalistic methods with respect to the rightsguaranteed by the Convention, or about the criteria that national jurisdictions may need to follow to adapttheir legislation to the standards set by human rights.Expulsion proceedings of terrorist suspectsPermanent residence permits—migration authorities—expulsion—terrorist suspects—assurances—rightto freedom from torture—art.3Deportation; Inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; Sweden; TerrorismX v Sweden (Application No.36417/16)European Court of Human Rights (Third Section): Judgment of 9 January 2018284 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsFactsThe applicant, who had been residing in Sweden since 2005 was granted permanent residence in 2007and had married a non-Swedish national in 2009, who also held a permanent residence permit in Sweden.In March 2016 the Swedish Security Service applied to the Migration Agency requesting the applicant’sexpulsion to Morocco. The applicant applied for asylum claiming that he would be forced to confess actsof terrorism and would be at risk of torture, if expelled. In April 2016 the Agency rejected the applicantsclaim for asylum noting that the human rights situation in Morocco had improved significantly. TheAgency found no reason to question the Security Service’s assessment and found the applicant lackedcredibility, as information provided by him had contradicted information of the Security Service. TheAgency also found that the applicant had not justified the claim that he risked persecution upon return toMorocco, taking into account that “no objective evidence suggested that the Moroccan authorities wereaware of his case”. This led the Agency to conclude there were grounds to expel the applicant, reject hisclaim for asylum and international protection, revoke his permanent residence, order his expulsion andimpose a lifelong ban on returning to Sweden. The applicant appealed, claiming the Agency had notconducted a careful examination and that the proceedings had been unfair and partial; with this leadingto the Agency forwarding the case to the Migration Court of Appeal. The Agency maintained its stanceand the Security Services stated that, while being as transparent as possible, they could not reveal theirworking methods and sources. On 22 June 2016 the Court of Appeal recommended that the Agency’sdecision be upheld and found that “there was nothing to support that the applicant at that point in timewas known by the Moroccan authorities and of interest to them.”Subsequently, the applicant applied to the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) on the 27 June2016 claiming a violation of arts 3 and 8. On 8 September 2016 the government upheld the Agency’sdecision in full. However, after interimmeasures indicated by the Court, on 22 September the governmentdecided to stay the enforcement of the expulsion order until further notice. On 3 November 2016 thecomplaint concerning art.3, relating to his expulsion to Morocco, was communicated to the governmentand the remainder of the application was declared inadmissible.Held(1) The application was admissible (unanimous).(2) The implementation of the expulsion order against the applicant would give rise to a violationof art.3 (unanimous).In assessing relevant general principles, the Court noted that art.3 implies an obligation tonot deport a person to a country where they face a real risk of being subject to treatmentcontrary to art.3. This is absolute and cannot be weighed against reasons put forward for theexpulsion. The Court recognised that the national authorities are best placed to assess thefacts in such cases, but theymust be satisfied that their assessment is adequate and sufficientlysupported by materials originating from other reliable and objective sources. If the applicanthas not already been deported, the material point in time for the assessment must be that ofthe Court’s consideration of the case. A full examination is required, which requires takinginto account information that has come to light after the final decision by the domesticauthorities. The Court’s assessment must focus on the foreseeable consequences of theapplicant’s expulsion, taking into consideration the general situation there and the applicant’spersonal circumstances. It is the applicant who must adduce evidence capable ofdemonstrating that there are substantial grounds for believing they would be exposed to areal risk of being subject to treatment contrary to art.3, with the respondent state responsiblefor dispelling any doubts raised by the applicant’s evidence. The Court accepts that thisCase and Comment 285[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsinvolves a “certain degree of speculation” and does not require the applicant to necessarilyprovide clear proof of their claim.In applying these general principles, the Court noted that, as seen within a series of citedinternational materials, the human rights situation in Morocco has indeed improved. TheCourt also recognised that the applicant had failed to show that he was of previous interestto the Moroccan authorities, citing his ability to freely travel in and out of Morocco as wellas to use his passport to travel internationally. Consequently, the Court found that there were“no indications that the applicant would be detained and ill-treated by the Moroccanauthorities upon return for any reason unrelated to his being considered a security risk inSweden”. This led to the Court assessing whether his return for being a security risk inSweden would result in the applicant facing a real risk of being subject to ill-treatment oftorture. The analysis began with the applicant’s claim that, as theMoroccan authorities knowhe is considered a Swedish security threat, he will be arrested on return and subject to torture.It was recognised by the Court that the government had acknowledged that the SecurityServices have informed the Moroccan authorities about the applicant, thus making themaware that he was considered a security threat in Sweden. Having had regard for reliableinternational sources that showed arbitrary detention and torture continue to occur inMoroccoin cases concerning persons considered security threats and suspected of terrorism, the Courtfound that the applicant has shown that there is a risk of him being subjected to treatmentcontrary to art.3 if expelled to his home country.At the same time, the Swedish authorities failed to dispel the doubts raised by the applicant.The Court noted that both the decision of the Migration Agency and Court of Appeal weremade without knowledge of the Security Services having contactedMorocco and informingit of the applicant’s expulsion. As a result, the Court found that it could not rely on thosedecisions. The Court also noted that the government had seen no reason to take specialmeasures to ensure the applicant was not subject to treatment contrary to art.3, despite theirrecognition of the risk of ill-treatment during detention of suspected terrorists in Morocco.The Court considered that themigration authorities lack of access to all relevant and importantinformation raises concern as to the rigour and reliability of the domestic proceedings.Furthermore, the Court highlighted that, although the human rights situation is improvingin Morocco, the relevant authorities had given no assurances concerning the safety of thevictim should he be expelled. As a result, the Court concluded that the applicant’s expulsionto Morocco would involve a violation of art.3.(3) It indicated to the government that is desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of theproceedings not to expel the applicant until such time as the present judgment becomes finalor until further order under r.39 of the Rules of Court.Cases consideredAssenov v Bulgaria (1999) 28 E.H.R.R. 652Chahal v United Kingdom (1997) 23 E.H.R.R. 413FG v Sweden (App. No.43611/11), judgment of 23 March 2016Hirsi Jamaa v Italy (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 21Maslov v Austria (App. No.1638/03), judgment of 23 June 2008Othman (Abu Qatada) v United Kingdom (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 1Paposhvili v Belgium (App. No.41738/10), judgment of 13 December 2016Saadi v Italy (2009) 49 E.H.R.R. 30Salah Sheekh v Netherlands (App. No.1948/04), judgment of 11 January 2007286 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsTrabelsi v Belgium (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 21Vilvarajah v United Kingdom (1991) 14 E.H.R.R. 248CommentaryThis case provides interesting insights into the Court’s considerations with regards to cases concerningexpulsion to countries where applicants could be at risk of being subjected to torture or other ill-treatment.A particular area of interest is the extent to which the Court might use its own investigations to challengethe proceedings of a state in expulsion cases. The Court recognised within the case that, “as a generalprinciple, the national authorities are best placed to assess” such cases, though such assessments shouldbe both “adequate and sufficiently supported”. However, the Court also accepts that, in cases such as this,it has to carry out a full and ex nunc evaluation of the foreseeable consequences of the applicant’s removalin light of the human rights situation in a country and of his/her personal circumstances. In this case, thisevaluation led the Court to consider information not available to theMigration Agency of the state, leadingto the conclusion that the government’s activities raise concern as to the rigour and reliability of thedomestic proceedings. This resulted in the finding that the Court could not rely on the domestic decisions,which in effect led to the Court’s analysis substituting that of the national authorities when finding thatexpelling the applicant would violate art.3. Although the lack of communication and transparency betweenthe national Security Services andMigration Agencies certainlymade the domestic proceedings inadequate,it is still notable that the Court has taken such an active role. It is questionable whether making use of itsfull and ex nunc evaluations the Court could in future end up substituting a respondent state’s domesticdecisions in expulsion-related cases. What is undeniable, however, is the approach of the Court that theprotection of art.3 is absolute and that security or terrorist threats cannot be used as an excuse for restrictingits absolute nature.Pre-trial detention of minors and right to freedom of peaceful assemblyPre-trial detention of minor—propaganda—terrorist organisation—Kurdish Working Party (PKK)—Abdullah Öcalan—Turkey—right to liberty—art.5—right to freedom of peaceful assembly—art.11Demonstrations; Detention; Freedom of peaceful assembly; Minors; Pre-trial procedure; Right toliberty and security; TurkeyAgit Demir v Turkey (Application No.36475/10)European Court of Human Rights: Decision of 27 February 2018FactsIn December 2009, the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party organised a demonstration in Cizre, Turkey,against the detention conditions of the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), Abdullah Öcalan.The applicant, who was 13 years old at the time, was suspected of propaganda in support of the PKK andof having stood against security forces by use of arms. After being arrested in January 2010, the applicantconfessed to waving a portrait of Abdullah Öcalan. However, he denied having thrown stones at thesecurity forces. He was placed in pre-trial custody. A criminal action was opened against him in February2010 for participating in an illegal demonstration called upon by the PKK and for membership of thisorganisation. The applicant claimed before the Court of Assize of Diyarbakir that he was coming backCase and Comment 287[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsfrom school when he found himself in the middle of the demonstrators and had only picked the sign withÖcalan’s portrait up from the floor. The Court of Assize of Diyarbakir declined jurisdiction in December2010, considering that it was a matter for the Correctional Tribunal of Cizre as a juvenile court. An expertreport on the video records confirmed that the applicant was among the demonstrators, waved a portraitof Abdullah Öcalan and threw a stone at the security forces. He was sentenced in March 2012 by thetribunal to a year and 15 days imprisonment for propaganda in support of a terrorist organisation andparticipating in a violent demonstration. However, the tribunal decided to stay the judgment for a periodof three years and the applicant was acquitted from the charge of membership of a terrorist organisation.The applicant claimed that his pre-trial detention was in violation of art.5(1)(c) of the Convention, onthe ground that it was not a measure of last resort. He also complained about the length of his detentionunder art.5(3), as well as a violation of his right to have an effective remedy under art.13. Moreover, healleged violations of arts 10, 11, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 14.Held(1) The Court declared the complaint regarding art.5(1)(c) admissible (unanimous).(2) There had been a violation of art.5(1)(c) (unanimous).The Court reiterated that one of the main elements to be considered when assessing thelegality of the detention was the absence of arbitrariness. The deprivation of liberty cannotbe ordered unless other less severe measures have been contemplated by the judge anddeemed insufficient in the safeguard of the personal and public interest. The Turkish CriminalProcedure Code provides that a person can be placed in detention if two cumulative conditionsare met: there must be a strong suspicion that the individual committed the alleged offence;and there must be a ground of detention. However, even if those conditions are met, thejudge is still under an obligation to search for less severe alternative measures. The Courtnoted that, in this case, the applicant was a minor and had been detained for more than twomonths, mainly on accusation of propaganda in support of a terrorist organisation throughhis participation in a demonstration. The Turkish legislation guarantees that the detentionof a minor must be a measure of last resort. In the circumstances of the case, the judge didnot appear to have considered alternative measures.(3) There was no need to examine art.5(3) (unanimous).The Court considered that the complaint in relation to the length of detention under art.5need not be examined. It further contended that the allegation of violation of art.5(4), whichis the lex specialis of art.13 and guarantees that everyone who is deprived of their libertyby arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of theirdetention shall be decided speedily by a court, was inadmissible. The Court relied on itsearlier jurisprudence in which it concluded that the procedure that was available underTurkish law to oppose decisions of detention did not meet the requirements of art.5(4) inthat it was not judicial in nature and did not present the procedural guarantees required fora deprivation of liberty. However, the legislation was amended in 2004. Since then, detaineescan be heard by the judicial authority during the examination of the opposition request. TheCourt concluded that the opposition procedure constituted a proceeding within the meaningof art.5(4), and that the applicant had failed to oppose any of the detention decisions thatwere taken against him.(4) There had been a violation of art.11 (unanimous).Although this was not expressly invoked in the applicant’s complaint, the Court decided toexamine the potential existence of a violation of his right to freedom of peaceful assemblyunder art.11, in light of art.10 of the Convention. The applicant’s conviction for propaganda288 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsin support of a terrorist organisation implicitly put into question his right to freedom topeacefully protest.The Court declared that the circumstances of the case were similar to the ones in the Gülcucase, in which it concluded that the detention and conviction of M. Gülcu constituted aninterference with the latter’s right to freedom of assembly. The interference in the presentcase was provided for by the law and pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of nationalsecurity and public order. However, the Court had already held in its previous case-law thatthe mere act of waving a portrait of Abdullah Öcalan during a demonstration was neither aform of expression inciting to violence, to armed resistance or to insurgency, nor constitutedhate speech. The Court recognised the Contracting State’s margin of appreciation in decidingwhich measures the national authorities could use to protect the judicial and public order.Although the applicant’s judgment was stayed for three years, this did not lessen the factthat he had been detained for over two months and was threatened with a three-yearimprisonment sentence, especially since he was only 13 years old at the time. Hence, themeasures taken were not proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued.(5) The complaints under arts 3, 8, 2 of Protocol No.1 to the Convention, and 6, 7 and 14 wererejected.(6) The state was ordered to pay €7,500 for non-pecuniary damage.Cases consideredAltinok v Turkey (App. No.31610/08), judgment of 29 January 2011Ambruszkiewicz v Poland (App. No.3879/03), judgment of 4 May 2006Bağrıyanık v Turkey (App. No.43256/04), judgment of 5 May 2007Bolech v Switzerland (App. No. 30138/12), judgment of 29 October 2013Centre for legal resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v Romania [GC] (App. No.47848/08),judgment of 17 July 2014DG v Ireland (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 33Faruk Temel v Turkey (App. No.16853/05), judgment of 1 February 2011Ezelin v France (1992) 14 E.H.R.R. 362Fressoz and Roire v France [GC] (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 2Gavril Yosifov v Bulgaria (App. No.74012/01), judgment of 6 November 2008Gülcü v Turkey (App. No.17526/10), judgment of 31 August 2012Jėčius v Lithuania (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 16Kadem v Malta (2003) 37 E.H.R.R. 18Kasparov v Russia (App. No.21613/07), judgment of 3 October 2013Khayredinov v Ukraine (App. No.38717/04), judgment of 14 October 2010Konolos v Romania (App. No.26600/02), judgment of 10 March 2011Korneykova v Ukraine (App. No.39884/05), judgment of 19 January 2012Kudrevicius v Lithuania [GC] (2016) 62 E.H.R.R. 34Ladent v Poland (App. No.11036/03), judgment 18 March 2008Lütfiye Zengin v Turkey (App. No.36443/06), judgment of 14 April 2015Müdür Duman v Turkey (App. No.15450/03), judgment of 6 October 2015Murat Vural v Turkey (App. No.9540/07), judgment of 21 October 2014Nikolova v Bulgaria (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 3Özgür Radyo-Ses Radyo Televizyon Yayın Yapım Ve Tanıtım AŞ v Turkey (App. Nos 64178/00,64179/00, 64181/00, 64183/00 and 64184/00), judgment of 30 March 2006RT v Greece (App. No.5124/11), judgment of 11 February 2016Case and Comment 289[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsŞayık v Turkey (App. Nos 1966/07, 9965/07, 35245/07, 35250/07, 36561/07, 36591/07 and 40928/07),judgment of 8 December 2009Schwabe and MG v Germany (2011) 59 E.H.R.R. 28Şık v Turkey (App. No.53413/11), judgment of 8 July 2014Sevim v Turkey (App. Nos 7540/07, 7859/07 and 11979/07), judgment of 5 January 2010Suso Musa v Malta (App. No.42337/12), judgment of 23 July 2013Valada Matos das Neves v Portugal (App. No.73798/13), judgment of 29 October 2015Women on Waves v Portugal (App. No.31276/05), judgment of 3 February 2009Yılmaz et Kılıç v Turkey (App. No. 68514/01), judgment of 17 July 2008CommentaryThe decision of the Court in this case is relatively straightforward in that the Court was unanimous andessentially reaffirmed its existing jurisprudence. The judges firmly asserted that the detention of a minorcould only be for a short time. The Court drew a comparison with the Gülcu case, in which a minor wasdetained for two years after he participated in a demonstration in Diyarbakir. The facts were very similar,in that M. Gülcu had also thrown stones at the security forces. He was convicted of membership of thePKK and of propaganda in support of a terrorist organisation and resistance to the police. The Court haddenounced the harshness of the sentences imposed on him. In the present case, the Turkish judge appearsnot to have considered alternative measures, even though this is required by the law. Beyond the severityof the sentences, this case reflects a wider political debate. The applicant did not invoke art.11 in hisapplication and expressly claimed a violation of art.11 in later observations. However, the Court drewfrom the fact that he was detained for membership of a terrorist organisation and propaganda in supportof the PKK a substantial claim that his right to freedom of assembly had been breached. Many peoplehave been detained and convicted on similar charges for taking part in pro-Kurdish protests in Turkey.This case may be even more significant in the current context of emergency state which was proclaimedafter the attempted coup in July 2016. Since then, the Turkish government has brought criminal proceedingsagainst numerous people accused of defamation or based on terrorist charges. This case thus falls withinthe scope of an ongoing political repression of freedom of speech and assembly in Turkey.Providing care for the children of arrested parentsArrest—caring responsibilities—children—best interests—positive obligations—right to family—art.8Bulgaria; Children’s services; Children's welfare; Right to respect for private and family lifeHadzhieva v Bulgaria (Application No.45285/12)European Court of Human Rights (Fifth Section): Judgment of 1 February 2018FactsThe present case concerns a claim brought by a child of Russian and Turkmen nationality, Ms DzherenAnnadurdievna Hadzhieva (the applicant) against the Republic of Bulgaria for a breach of art.8. Originallyfrom Turkmenistan, the applicant, along with her parents, moved to Bulgaria in late 2001. Whilst inTurkmenistan the applicant’s father was the deputy chair of the Central Bank of Turkmenistan and acritical opponent of the domestic legal regime. On 22 October 2002 the applicant’s father and mother290 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorswere charged with embezzlement of $40million and the prosecutor of Turkmenistan ordered their detentionand sought an extradition order from Bulgaria. On 4 December 2002 the applicant, whilst at home byherself, was confronted by around 10 police officers who had arrived at her home, seeking to arrest herparents. The applicant rang her parents and they returned home also bringing their lawyer with them.Upon their return, they were immediately arrested. The next day, after previously having a 24-hourdetention order set aside for lack of legal grounds, the applicant’s parents were served with a new 72-hourdetention order and again immediately detained. On 6 December 2002, the detention order was extendedto a period of 30 days by the Varna Regional Court. During the hearing, in accordance with domesticlegislation, the judge sought to discover whether there would be anybody available to care for the applicantwhilst her parents were detained. It is alleged by the applicant that when asked by the judge whether therewould be anybody to care for her the mother simply “shook” her head which in Bulgaria is used to signifyagreement whilst “nodding” is used to signify disapproval. As such, it is alleged by the applicant that thejudge mis-recorded her mother’s response when he noted that there was somebody available to care forthe applicant.In the 13 days between 4 and 17 December 2002, the applicant alleges that there was nobody to takecare of her. Due the hastiness of the arrest, her parents had no chance to leave her any money and she wasrequired to attempt survival on the 15 levs (around €7) which she had found in the house. She furtheralleges that as a result of having been left alone without supervision she suffered from insomnia ornightmares during the rare instances when she could sleep. Further, she was also constantly worried aboutbeing sent back to Turkmenistan where her family had faced persecution. The applicant also alleged thatshe had to ask neighbours how to get to school as she did not know the way and was, at some point, bittenby a stray dog on the leg—a wound which went untreated until 18 December when her mother took herto hospital.After a previous failed attempt due to the misinterpretation of points of law the applicant brought aclaim to the Varna Regional Court on 25 October 2007 alleging a breach of the Bulgarian Child ProtectionAct. A psychiatric-psychological report was prepared which diagnosed the applicant with post-traumaticstress disorder. This report was confirmed by a second report prepared in 2009. However, during theseproceedings the Regional Court also heard evidence from the applicant’s teacher who stated that she couldnot remember a time when the applicant had missed class or gone hungry at school as alleged by theapplicant. Based on the above evidence, the Varna Regional Court rejected the applicant’s claim on thebasis that it had not been proven that she was left on her own during the time her parents were detained.The applicant appealed to the Varna Court of Appeal which affirmed the findings of the lower court.Following that decision, the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation which rejected herappeal on the grounds that there were no points of law on which to advance an appeal.The applicant then complained to the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that the failure ofdomestic authorities to provide her with care whilst her parents were detained constituted a breach of art.8.Held(1) There had been a violation of art.8 during the first two days for which the applicant’s parentswere detained (four votes to three).The Court affirmed that although art.8 is primarily concerned with preventing arbitraryinterference with a citizen’s private life by state officials those negative obligations are alsoaccompanied by positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private and familylife. The Court also reaffirmed its previous jurisprudence and stated that the positiveobligations upon the state under art.8 in the context of minors require that the best interestsof the child be respected.Case and Comment 291[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe Court noted that the police had not notified the relevant authorities that the parents ofa minor were being detained, and that this meant she was subsequently left unattended. TheCourt also considered that the first time the domestic authorities had enquired into the careof the applicant was at the hearing which took place two days after her parent’s arrest. Basedon these facts, the Court took the view that the domestic authorities had a positive obligationto either allow the applicant’s parents to arrange care for her when they were taken intocustody or to do so themselves. Accordingly, the Court found that there had been a breachof art.8 between 4 and 6 December.(2) There was no violation of art.8 for the period after the 6 December (unanimous).In relation to the period after 6 December, the Court noted that the applicant’s parents wererepresented at all of their hearings by a lawyer who was also a family friend and neighbour.The Court also noted that the applicant’s parents were highly educated professionals froma prominent background and that her mother had confirmed that there was someone availableto care for their daughter. In any event, the parents had not raised the question of theapplicant’s care with any of the authorities and had not sought to correct the misinterpretationof the domestic court’s record which would have been sufficient to alert the authorities.Taking these points together the Court found that the domestic authorities had no reason toassume or suspect that after 6 December 2002 the applicant was uncared for, and as a resultthe positive obligation to ensure the child was cared for was not relevant.Cases consideredBevacqua and S v Bulgaria (App. No.71127/01), judgment of 12 June 2008Ioan Pop v Romania (App. No.52924/09), judgment of 6 December 2016Haase v Germany (2005) 40 E.H.R.R. 19Mayeka v Belgium (2008) 46 E.H.R.R. 23X v Netherlands (1986) 8 E.H.R.R 235CommentThe judgment is significant as it demonstrates the extent to which art.8 can be interpreted to go outsideof its ordinary meaning. The majority had no hesitation in interpreting previous jurisprudence of the Courtin a way that supports the activation of art.8 in circumstances in which children whose parents are arrestedare uncared for. Judges Møse, O’Leary and Rousseva, however, contended that the question of whethera state has fallen short of its positive obligations under art.8 requires a careful case-by-case analysis. Theytherefore argued that the cases relied upon by the majority should have been distinguished from this casebecause of their very different set of facts. The dissenting opinion placed more emphasis on the lack ofevidence to suggest that the parents had enquired the arrangements which had beenmade for their daughter.When the above fact was coupled with the prominent and well-educated background of the applicant’sparents, the dissenting judges found this sufficient to find that the domestic authorities had not failed todischarge their obligations under art.8. In practical terms, the case confirmed the approach of the Courtthat art.8 should be interpreted to protect children’s best interests, while also reiterating that the positiveobligations of states under art.8 cannot be unlimited.292 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsRight to stand for electionBy-elections—general elections—party unrepresented in Parliament—prohibition of discrimination—art.14—right to free elections—art. 3 of the Protocol to the ConventionBy-elections; Discrimination; Election candidates; Right to free elections; RomaniaCernea v Romania (Application No.43609/10)European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section): Judgment of 27 February 2018FactsThe applicant, M. Remus Florinel Cernea, is Romanian national residing in Bucharest. At the materialtime, he was the Executive President of Partidul Verde, a political party affiliated with the European GreenParty.In 2008, Partidul Verde fielded candidates for the legislative elections but none of them obtained a seat.A year later, a seat became vacant in a Bucharest constituency, and by-elections were organised on 17January 2010 in order to fill that seat. Partidul Verde presented the applicant as its candidate for theseby-elections but the Electoral Board rejected the candidature on the ground that the party was not representedin Parliament. This was justified by the Parliamentary amendments to Law No.35/2008 that made itimpossible for a party not represented in Parliament, or for an independent candidate, to respectively fieldcandidates or to run for by-elections.M. Cernea contested before the Bucharest County Court the decision to reject his candidature arguingthat art.48(17) of Law No.35/2008 was unconstitutional. He alleged in particular that the impossibilityfor candidates of a party not represented in Parliament and for independent candidates to run for by-electionsinfringed the right to free elections and created an unjustified discrimination vis-à-vis parties representedin Parliament. The county court referred the case to the Constitutional Court which dismissed the exceptionof unconstitutionality. In March 2010, the county court followed the Constitutional Court’s reasoning anddismissed the case arguing that Partidul Verde could not field candidates for the by-elections because ithad not passed the electoral threshold at the general legislative elections.The applicant complained before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that art.14 (prohibitionof discrimination) read in conjunction with art.3 of Protocol 1 to the Convention (right to free elections)have been breached by Romania.Held(1) There had been no violation of art.14 read in conjunctionwith art.3 of Protocol 1 (unanimous).The Court reiterated that discrimination consists of treating differently, without an objectiveand reasonable justification, persons in comparable situations. A differential treatment isdevoid of an objective and reasonable justification when it does not pursue a legitimate aim,or the means employed are disproportionate to the aim pursued.First, the Court noted that the differential treatment provided for by law had prevented M.Cernea from running for the by-elections because his party was not represented in Parliament.The Court also noted that the Constitutional Court had responded to the applicant’s argumentconcerning the Venice Commission’s recommendation on electoral matters. Indeed, theCase and Comment 293[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsVenice Commission’s Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters which recommends toeither avoid amending the electoral law less than a year before any elections or writing theamendments in the constitution or at a level higher than ordinary law, had been respectedsince Law No.35/2008 was amended under an organic law which, in the RomanianConstitution, requires a broader consensus than ordinary law. Moreover, the particularcontext of by-elections which are not supposed to be held at regular and foreseeable intervalsand which randomly depend on seats falling vacant in Parliament, was also taken into accountby the Court.Second, concerning the legitimate aim of the different treatment, the Court agreed with theRomanian government that the aim of the amendment was to reinforce the expression ofthe opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature. The objective was to preserve thestructure of Parliament and to prevent the fragmentation of the political views following thegeneral elections.Concerning the proportionality of the different treatment, the Court noted that the by-electionshad been organised only for one vacant seat in a Bucharest constituency. The limitation ofthe applicant’s right must therefore be relativised, especially since he, together with hisparty, had not reached the electoral threshold to enter Parliament in the 2008 general elections.As the Constitutional Court had noted, the aim of by-elections is certainly not to open abackdoor to a party which had previously failed to obtain seats in Parliament.The Court concluded that the amendment of Law No.35/2008, which has limited theapplicant’s right to run for the by-elections, had been objectively and reasonably justified.The amendment did not violate the essence of the people’s right to freedom of expressionof their opinion in the choice of the legislature and was consequently not disproportionateto the legitimate aim pursued.Cases consideredAndrejeva v Latvia (2010) 51 E.H.R.R. 28Dupré v France (App. No.77032/12), judgment of 3 May 2016Etxeberria v Spain (App. Nos 35579/03 and three others), judgment of 30 June 2009Mathieu-Mohin v Belgium (1988) 10 E.H.R.R. 1Matthews v United Kingdom (1999) 28 E.H.R.R. 361Özgürlük ve Dayanisma Partisi (ÖDP) v Turkey (App. No.7819/03), judgment of 22 October 2012Sejdić and Finci v Bosnia-Herzegovina (App. Nos 27996/06 and 34836/06), judgment of 22 December2009Soukhovetski v Ukraine (App. No.13716/02), judgment of 28 March 2006Yumak and Sadak v Turkey (App. No.10226/03), judgment of 8 July 2008CommentaryIn the present case, the Court reiterated that the terms “free expression of the opinion of the people”contained in art.3 of Protocol 1 to the Convention mean that no pressure shall be put on the electors in thechoice of one or more candidates, and that the electors cannot be unduly induced to vote for one party oranother. The word “choice” means that political parties should have a reasonable opportunity to field theircandidates to the elections. However, the rights contained in art.3 of the Protocol are not absolute and theContracting States have a wide margin of appreciation in this regard. Moreover, concerning the right tostand for election, the Court considers it should be especially cautious when examining limitations in thatcontext. With that in mind, the Court considered that the restriction on M. Cernea’s right to stand in the294 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsby-elections, arising from the law, was justified by the aim of preserving the structure of Parliament andpreventing major change in its political composition obtained after the general elections. The restrictionwas not considered disproportionate by the Court since the by-elections were organised only for one vacantseat and M. Cernea had had the opportunity to stand for the general elections. Therefore, the restrictionattached to right to stand as a candidate for elections in this case did not infringe the essence of the rightsat stake.Involuntary hospitalisation of mentally ill individualsCompulsory treatment—involuntary hospitalisation—consent—criminal offenders—judicial authorisation—deprivation of liberty—art.5Detention in hospital; Personality disorders; Right to liberty and security; RussiaX v Russia (Application No.3150/15)European Court of Human Rights (Third Section): Judgment of 20 February 2018FactsMr X, a Russian national born in 1995 and residing in Moscow, is the applicant and has requestedanonymity. He was diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder (date unspecified) and was beingvoluntarily treated for this.On 24 April 2014, Mr X was in the Bibirevo district of Moscow and arrested for allegedly harassingan underage teenager. He was taken to a local police station, but later transferred to Central ClinicalPsychiatric Hospital of the Moscow Region. The ambulance service reported Mr X to be “mentally alert[and] aware of his surroundings”. However, the applicant was unwilling to engage in contact, butacknowledged the existence of the teenager and the repeated instances of sexual harassment. The psychiatristresponsible for admitting Mr X to the hospital reported him “ask[ing] for some time to spend with boys”and on the following day the applicant was jointly assessed with another psychiatrist. Mr X revealed thatfor the past three years he had been “fixated on these thoughts” of “feeling the desire to be in contact withboys, to look like a girl” and he had “started contemplating the possibility of gender reassignment”. Onthis same day, the applicant requested to be discharged from the hospital, but to no avail. A medicalcounselling panel of the hospital’s resident psychiatrists insistedMr X to be a danger to himself and others,in need of involuntary placement and treatment.On 25 April 2014 the hospital also applied for judicial authorisation to involuntarily hospitalise theapplicant under s.29(a) and (c) of the Psychiatric Assistance Act 1992. On 5 May 2014 the SavyolovskiyDistrict Court of Moscow held a hearing which was attended by the applicant, his mother and father, theattending psychiatrist (Mr P), the head of a hospital department (Mr L) and a representative of the hospital(Mrs K), along with the prosecutor. All medical staff insisted Mr X needed treatment for the organicdelusional disorder they had diagnosed himwith and should he go untreated,Mr Xwould risk deterioration.The applicant and his parents denied that Mr X was unwell. After considering all statements, the policereport andmedical opinions, the district court authorised involuntary hospitalisation.Mr X’s father appealedon the grounds of inconsistencies in evidence and that the court had mainly relied on psychiatricassessments.On 20 May 2014 the applicant was discharged from the hospital after his mental health improved. Theapplicant complained to the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that his involuntary placementCase and Comment 295[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsin a psychiatric facility had been in breach of art.5 (1) and (4) because it failed to meet the substantiveand procedural requirements for involuntary hospitalisation.Held(1) There had been a violation of art.5(1) (unanimous).The Court reiterated that a person’s physical liberty is fundamental to the protection ofphysical security of the individual. Only “very weighty reasons” can justify a restriction ofone’s rights and only in a situation where less severe measures have been deemed inadequatein upholding personal and public safety. Detention of a person of unsound mind can onlybe lawful under art.5 in an emergency situation, when the mental disorder is of a kind thatwarrants compulsory confinement, or where continued confinement is due to the persistenceof the disorder. Domestic proceedings in such cases must offer the applicant “fair and properprocedure” and satisfactory protection against deprivation of liberty.There was no need to separately examine the complaint under art.5(4) that there had beenprocedural shortcomings in the judicial authorisation of his involuntary hospitalisation.(2) The state is to pay the applicant €7,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage (unanimous).(3) The remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction was dismissed (unanimous).Cases consideredAlajos Kiss v Hungary (2013) 56 E.H.R.R. 38Herz v Germany (App. No.44672/98), judgment of 12 June 2003Karamanof v Greece (App. No.46372/09), judgment of 26 July 2011Luberti v Italy (1984) 6 E.H.R.R. 440McKay v United Kingdom (2007) 44 E.H.R.R. 41Mifobova v Russia (App. No.5525/11), judgment of 5 February 2015Ruslan Makarov v Russia (App. No.19129/13), judgment of 11 October 2016Shtukaturov v Russia (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 27Vasileva v Denmark (2006) 40 E.H.R.R. 27Winterwerp v Netherlands (1979) 2 E.H.R.R. 387Zagidulina v Russia (App. No.11737/06), judgment of 2 May 2013CommentaryThe Court’s decision on this case was unanimous. Unfair and improper procedure can be observed inseveral aspects of the case. This can be seen in both the domestic court, which had based their judgmententirely on the evaluations of the resident psychiatric staff, but also in the hospital’s conduct towards theapplicant.The police report regarding Mr X’s arrest on 24 April 2014 failed to detail the events which led to theapplicant’s arrest—or even whether the arrest was prompted by a complaint made by the teenage boyinvolved or another member of the public. The local police station’s certificates, issued in May 2014,stated that the applicant had not committed any administrative or criminal offence. In light of this, onebegs the question of whyMr X was arrested in the first place. The domestic courts failed to independentlyestablish whether or not he posed a real threat to himself or others. The hospital had also failed to exploreother treatment avenues before they insisted on involuntary hospitalisation and their decision of treatmentwas based on the failure of the applicant to clearly answer questions regarding the incident with the teenageboy.296 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsIn light of these failures, the decision of the Court is a strong reminder of the safeguards needed fordepriving mentally ill individuals of their liberty. The case is also important both because of the legalregulation of mental healthcare and the treatment of homosexuals in Russia. Under the Russian CriminalCode, compulsory treatment can be given to patients with a mental illness who commit socially dangerousacts. This requires the police to confirm that an individual poses threats to the public and a psychiatricexpert who assesses and confirms the risk. This means that it is the duty of the police to prove that anindividual is dangerous, which did not happen in this case. Given the treatment of homosexuals in Russia,it is unsurprising both that the police found against the applicant without any evidence and that the applicantwas anxious about answering questions regarding his relationship with the teenage boy. The case istherefore important not only for mentally ill individuals, but also for those individuals whose personalcircumstances might make them even more vulnerable.Expropriation of property for commercial useExpropriation of property—public interest—commercial use—delayed compensation—right to fair trial—art.6—right to property—art.1 Protocol 1Expropriation; Malta; Protection of property; Right to fair trialGalea v Malta (Application No.68980/13)European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section): Judgment of 13 February 2018FactsThe applicants were six Maltese nationals who held utile dominium over a piece of land in Zabbar, Malta,since 2002. The land had previously been held by generations of their family for 150 years, and their rightsover the land were due to expire in 2047. On 7 May 1965 the government took possession of an 80 m2part of the land, including a shop building which was being rented out to third parties, by way of the LandAcquisition (Public Purposes) Ordinance, to build a civic centre and servicing roads.The shop was demolished, but subsequent changes to the building plans in 1972 meant that a new(larger) shop building was built, partly on the land which previously belonged to the applicants, to servicethe civic centre. The shop was leased to the same third party, and the remaining land which was not usedfor the shop and had previously belonged to the applicants was returned to them in 1988. Compensationof €13,000 was finally offered in October 2010.The applicants sought return of the property used to build the shop by way of extra-judicial requestsand filed constitutional redress proceedings. The extra-judicial requests were unsuccessful, but theapplication for constitutional redress was successful at first instance, and the Civil Court (First Hall)annulled the Governor’s original declaration of May 1965 taking possession of the property, on the basisthat the delayed compensation had denied the opportunity to appeal the amount, and that the land had notbeen taken in the public interest as it had been leased to third parties as a shop (therefore for commercialpurposes).This decision was appealed by the government to the Constitutional Court, which reversed part of thefirst instance decision. It held that the taking of the property had been in the public interest despite itschange in use in 1972. While upholding that the applicants’ property rights had been violated by the delayin compensation, they reversed the remedy offered by the first instance court, annulling the return orderfor the property and offering non-pecuniary damages less than the value of the property (€10,000).Case and Comment 297[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe applicants complained before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that the expropriationof their property without compensation was a violation of their right to property.Held(1) The Court decided to join to the merits the government’s objection concerning the applicants’lack of victim status and dismissed it after considering the merits (unanimous).The government argued that the application was inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded onaccount of the applicants’ lack of victim status. They claimed that this was lost followingthe Constitutional Court judgment, which granted them compensation for violations of art.6and art.1 of Protocol No.1 of the Convention. The applicants claimed that the judgment bythe Constitutional Court, in not awarding pecuniary damage, had not sufficiently rectifiedthe violation of their property rights. They also disputed that their art.6 claim had beenexamined by the Constitutional Court, but the government claimed that this had been donetogether with art.1 of Protocol No.1. The Court considered the government’s objection tobe closely linked to the substance of the applicants’ complaints, and so examined this withthe merits.(2) The Court declared the application admissible in so far as it refers to the period after 23January 1967 (unanimous).The appropriation of the applicants’ property had occurred in 1965, prior toMalta becomingparty to the Convention in 1967. On this basis, they argued that no consideration was owedprior to 1967. The Court acknowledged that deprivation of property is viewed as aninstantaneous act rather than a continuing situation but found that the applicants’ complaintrelated to the failure of the Constitutional Court to order payment of pecuniary damage. TheCourt found themselves able to examine the failure to pay final compensation with respectto the events taking place after Malta’s 1967 accession to the Convention but upheld thegovernment’s objection with respect to the period before that date.(3) The Court held that there was a violation of art.1 of Protocol No. 1 (unanimous).The Court held that there was a violation of the applicants’ right to property on the basisthat compensation still had not been paid to the applicants five decades after the propertyhad been taken. The Court considered that compensation could provide a justification forinterference, but that the government’s undue delay in providing compensation diminishedits adequacy, owing to the reduction in value and uncertain position in which the applicantswere for that time.The Court noted that non-pecuniary damage had been offered but refused, and consideredthat regardless of the adequacy of this, the delay would constitute a violation. They did,however, consider that the solely non-pecuniary damage (with potential to bring compensationproceedings 45 years after the taking) was not sufficient, and therefore dismissed thegovernment’s objection as to the victim status of the applicants.(4) The Court awarded €21,000 in respect of pecuniary damage to the applicants.(5) Having held that failure to grant pecuniary damage by the Maltese Constitutional Courtconstituted a violation of art.1 of Protocol No.1, the Court awarded this, but held that theoffer of €13,000 in non-pecuniary damage should also be maintained so that the applicantsmay benefit from this also.With respect to the calculation of pecuniary damage, the applicant offered valuation basedon market value of the property with the original shop building, whereas the governmentoffered a counter-valuation of a lesser sum, and argued that, the taking being lawful and in298 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthe public interest, the applicants should not be entitled to the market value, and they shouldnot be entitled to loss of rent, but instead the value of the property.The Court found that the property had originally been taken in the public interest, but thatwith the change of use in 1972 the property had been held for commercial gain. As such,they opted to adjust the valuation for pecuniary damage according to this factor, as well asthe returning of partial title, the increased rent from the building of a new shop, and thenature of the title held by the applicants.(6) The Court dismissed the remainder of the applicants’ claim for just satisfaction (unanimous).Cases consideredAbdilla v Malta (App. No.38244/03), judgment of 3 November 2005Aka v Turkey (2001) 33 E.H.R.R. 27Akkuş v Turkey (2000) 30 E.H.R.R. 533Garrett v Portugal (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 23Bezzina Wettinger v Malta (App. No.15091/06), judgment of 22 February 2012Curmi v Malta (App. No.2243/10), judgment of 22 November 2011Frendo Randon v Malta (App. No.2226/10), judgment of 22 November 2011Former King of Greece v Greece (2001) 33 E.H.R.R. 21Jahn v Germany (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 49James v United Kingdom (1986) 8 E.H.R.R. 123Malhous v Czech Republic (App. No.33071/96), judgment of 12 July 2001Mason v Italy (App. No.43663/98), judgment of 24 July 2007Schembri v Malta (2011) 52 E.H.R.R. SE2CommentaryThis case features a unanimous decision of the Court intervening to protect the applicant’s property rights.The taking of the property itself was not so much an issue as this happened prior to the accession of Maltato the Convention, however, the commercial gain by the state from the appropriated land after its changeof use was. The Court circumscribes the principle that the taking of the property is an instantaneous actand is not a continuing situation of deprivation by centring the discussion in the case around the processof obtaining compensation, to dispense with the ratione temporis objection. While this, as the applicantsoften argue, could be construed as an art.6 issue with relation to the failure to properly administer justice,the Court chose to look at this solely with respect to art.1 of Protocol No.1.The Court also notes that the taking of the property, while originally in the public interest, was solelybeing used for commercial purposes when the new shop was rented back to the third party after 1972.This holding is used solely in the context of the calculation of compensation, as they neglect to examinethe lawfulness of the deprivation itself as discussed above. The Court acknowledged that the public interestcan be inclusive of economic and social benefit (relevant could have been the use of the shop for lorrydrivers at the civic centre), however, the result of this decision to grant higher compensation is perhapsunderstandable, as the Court stresses many times that the applicants had to wait over five decades for it.Case and Comment 299[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsBook ReviewsThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: ACommentary, by Valentina Della Fina (ed.), Rachele Cera (ed.) and Giuseppe Palmisano(ed.), (Springer, 2017), 804 pages, hardback, £128, ISBN: 978-3-31-943788-0.The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and its Optional Protocol wasadopted on 13 December 2006. Its purpose is “to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoymentof all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect fortheir inherent dignity”. The CRPD achieved the highest number of signatories recorded for a UNConventionon its opening day. It was the first comprehensive human rights treaty of the 21st century, and broke newground by being open for signature by regional organisations, such as the EU which ratified it on behalfof all of its Member States. The CRPD entered into force on 3 May 2008.The CRPD, as a human rights instrument, is explicit in its social development aim and dimension. Itachieves this by recognising and promoting a new human rights model for disability in order to ensurethat disabled people are treated as individuals with rights, and as active participants and members ofsociety. This is reflected both in the Convention’s protocols and within the substantive body of the treaty.An integral feature of the Convention lies in its recognition that the removal of societal barriers for disabledpeople is a critical factor in promoting and achieving equality.In this weighty textbook, the editors, who are based at the Institute for International Legal Studies inRome, have sought to produce an in-depth scholarly analysis of the Convention’s provisions and Protocolmarking its 10th anniversary. They provide a comprehensive analysis of the law and jurisprudence relatingto the CRPD, including by reference to relevant international human rights norms. They consider theprocess and debate which led to the creation of this treaty, a detailed analysis of the treaty articles, as wellas its continuing evolution as a result of the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of Personswith Disabilities (CRPDCommittee) and its opinions on individual or group complaints under the OptionalProtocol. They also consider the interpretations provided in the Committee’s General Comments, such asGeneral Comment No.1 on women and girls with disabilities and No.2 on the right to inclusive educationof persons with disabilities. The Convention’s provisions are examined also as they have been appliedand interpreted pursuant to EU law.The early chapters provide useful context and historical background of the struggle for the recognitionof the rights of persons with disabilities at the United Nations and the emergence of the disability rightsmovement internationally and then later the period in which international disability policy developed intoa rights-based policy. It was this new rights-based approach that led to the human rights model of disabilitywhich the Convention enshrines and promotes. That model is explored at the outset of book, and examineswhy the human rights model represents an improvement on the social model of disability. This is aconceptually important lens through which to interpret the CRPD’s provisions. As domestic judges areinvited more frequently to consider the CRPD, this informative but succinct chapter may prove to be auseful theoretical introduction as to why the human rights model succeeds where the social model onlypartially meets and confronts current challenges.Whereas the social model is intended to explain disability,the human rights model places dignity for disabled people at its heart. Whilst the social model of disabilitysupports anti-discrimination frameworks, the human rights model goes further and includes not only civiland political human rights, but social and economic rights as well in recognition of their interdependenceand indivisibility.[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors300This background material then leads on to a detailed analysis of the Preamble and each Conventionarticle. It considers the normative content, interpretation, concepts and difficulties arising from each article,as explored against human rights instruments and a wide variety of relevant case-law.The international range of editors and contributors to this volume is impressive and includes respectedacademics and lawyers, steeped in disability law and policy, as well as individuals who participated inthe negotiations and drafting of the CRPD itself. Thematerial is formatted in an accessible and user-friendlymanner. Whilst this is no doubt an academic text, it is a practical and valuable resource for practitionersand scholars alike, drawing together the editors’ and contributors’ own cumulative expertise and experiencein order to improve knowledge and promote more extensive use of the CRPD as an important tool tostrengthen disability protections worldwide. It will prove to be an important contribution to disabilityrights law and increased understanding of this ground-breaking Convention.Schona Jolly QCBarrister at Cloisters Chambers, LondonThe Rule of Law in the European Union: The Internal Dimension, by TheodoreKonstadinides, (Oxford: Hart, 2017), pp.200, £55, ISBN: 9781849464703.At the risk of portentousness, the Rule of Law in the European Union might be thought to be underconsiderable strain. Recent events in Hungary and Poland concerning judicial independence, the responseto the migration challenges, the Eurozone crisis, and Brexit—the modern legal equivalent of the internet’sGodwin’s Law—may well lead some to that conclusion. Indeed, it has been said that the Rule of Law inthe European Union is under a process of “backsliding”.1 In such circumstances—and whether or not sucha description is ultimately accurate—a book considering the rule of law in the European Union could notbe timelier.The Rule of Law in the European Union: The Internal Dimension by Thoedore Konstadinides (SeniorLecturer in Law at the University of Essex) purports, in its Preface, to be an “overarching guide to therule of law in the EU”. It achieves that aim comprehensively, yet concisely. The monograph begins, inPart 1, by exploring the design of the rule of law in the EU—its foundations (both descriptively andnormatively), evolution and geography. Part 2 is more likely to appeal to the practitioner, exploring howthe rule of law is enforced in the EU—first against EU institutions (Ch.4), and secondly against MemberStates (Ch.5).Across these two parts, a number of interweaving themes begin to emerge. The first theme is that ofevolution of the very concept of the rule of law as applied in the EU across time. Konstadinides states hisaim to explore what he calls “the EU rule of law” (p.15). This, he states, “does not imply the creation ofa new concept of the rule of law but rather a system where laws are applied and enforce as opposed to asystem characterised by arbitrary rule” (p.15). That may well be so, but—as is acknowledged—the ruleof law lacks a formal definition in the Treaty on European Union. The textual support is located in in parts2, 4(3) and 19(1) of the TEU, and (now also) the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.That leaves something of a conceptual vacuum, however, which has been filled, or perhaps simply covered,somewhat haphazardly over time.Konstadinides acknowledges that the rule of law conceptually is something of a “puzzle” (p.9) or a“stretch concept” (p.38) and “an empty vessel or a legal zeitgeist, depending on one’s view” (p.1). Heattempts to fill this vacuum by an exploration of the underpinning values and meaning of the EU rule of1 See further: Kim Lane Scheppele, https://verfassungsblog.de/what-is-rule-of-law-backsliding/ (2 March 2012), verfassungsblog.de (Accessed 21May 2018).Book Reviews 301[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorslaw in Ch.2 by addressing whether the EU rule of law is formal (focusing just on the manner in whichlaw is made or promulgated) or substantive (adding in content as well as the form of the law). He concludesthat it is both, and that the rule of law—in practice—can be located not just in the TEU and Charter (andthe substantive rights contained within), but also the constitutional principles of sincere co-operation,consistency, legitimate expectations, legal certainty, legality, and proportionality as developed over time(Ch.3). It strikes me, however, that this conception of the rule of law ought not to be “stretched” (to useKonstadinides’s term) too far. Konstadinides may himself do so: he claims that it “follows” from the factthat EU law has enriched UK law with rights that “the quality of the rule of law would be negativelyaffected when the UK decides to leave the EU due to the effect of such departure upon … EU-conferredrights” (p.27). Whatever one’s views on Brexit—and the consequences thereof—to claim that the veryessence of the rule of law is thereby necessarily infringed as a result is probably a stretch too far.The second theme—closely connected to the first—is the mode of the aforementioned evolution. Thedevelopment of the EU rule of law’s application in practice has been spearheaded not just by legislativedevelopment (e.g. the Charter), but primarily by the CJEU in well known cases beginning with Les Vertsand developed thereafter, most recently in C-64/16Associação Sindical dos Juízes Portugueses v Tribunalde Contas (decided after publication of the monograph). The role of the CJEU in this development andits utilisation of the EU rule of law is not without critics, a theme explored in Ch.4 rehearsing thewell-trodden criticisms of, for example, the restrictive test for individual standing in direct actions. AsKonstadinides states, the EU has a “newly-usurped rule-of-law guardian role” (p.3) and the CJEU playsa “pivotal role” in fulfilling that function (p.30). Whether that is desirable is a somewhat evolving matteropen for further exploration, as evidenced by the difference in approaches to the situations in Hungaryand Poland (and the differences between the art.7 TEU and art.258 TFEU procedures).The third theme is that of the tensions and contradictions within what the author calls “the EU rule oflaw” (p.15). This is evidenced across the monograph by various examples. First, as discussed in Ch.5, thegradual formulisation and judicialisaiton of the EU rule of law (especially with regard to holding EUinstitutions to account), compared with the increasing use of soft law and political means to promote therule of law at the same time (particularly in relation to the Member States’ adherence to the rule of law).Second, the asymmetry between the use of the rule of law internally in the EU, and the external standardssettings in the EU’s external relations. Third, the “double standards” in the rule of law’s application (p.6):as Konstadinides acknowledges, “the EU institutions” acts tend to be less prone to review compared tothose of theMember States”. Finally, there is an inherent tension between the EU rule of law being locatedin the concept “as it is commonly understood in the Member States and charges them with its promotion”(p.1), against the “EU offer[ing] a dynamic way of extending the rule of law principles beyond the strictbounds of the nation state” (p.1). This has created a “somewhat cryptic” (p.101) understanding of the EUrule of law such that Konstadinides is surely right to opine that “the adaptation of the rule of law to thesupranational level is a work in progress” (p.101). To end where this review began—the rule of law withinthe EU is a work in progress which is under strain. Anyone interested in that work in progress (or, indeed,examining or resolving those strains) would be well served by reading Konstadinides’ contribution to thedebate.Jack WilliamsBarrister, Monckton Chambers302 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsOpinionThe Case for aMore Ready Resort to DerogationsFrom the ECHR in the Current “WarOn Terror”Professor Helen FenwickDurham UniversityDr Daniel FenwickNorthumbria UniversityComparative law; Deprivation of citizenship; Derogations; Detention; EU law; France; Human rights;Prevention of terrorism; Terrorism prevention and investigation measures; TurkeyAbstractOver the last four to five years the terrorist threat faced by the contracting states of the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights (ECHR) has intensified and become more widespread.

IntroductionOver the last four to five years the terrorist threat faced by the contracting states of the ECHR has intensifiedand becomemore widespread. The threat has come to a significant extent from their own citizens, whetherfrom the far right or from jihadist Islamist groups. Since suspect nationals usually cannot be deported, itmight have been expected that detention or control measures, requiring derogations under art.15 of theECHR, would have been put in place in a number of the states. It is therefore of interest to note that veryfew derogations have been sought, despite the significant rise in recent terrorist activity. At present, onlyone derogation is in place in the contracting states, i.e. Turkey.This article considers why derogations have not played a pivotal role in the current “war on terror”,and connects the answer to some of the advantages of relying on derogations as opposed to exploringalternative ways of evading the ECHR guarantees. It argues that derogations are not currently playing therole envisaged for them by the founders of the ECHR, and that there is a case for resorting to reliance onthem more readily in the current situation.303[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors2. Methods of evading or minimising ECHR guarantees absent a derogationThe threat from ISIS-supporting nationals and from the far-right in ECHR contracting states has led themto consider and introduce an increasing array of counter-terrormeasures, including non-trial-basedmeasures,creating tensions with human rights norms. If the terrorism threat comes from a state’s own citizens, theyhave to be retained within its borders (with some exceptions), prompting the search for counter-terrormeasures that can be used to control their activities. But such measures may come into conflict with theECHR guarantees, in particular that of the right to liberty under art.5. If no derogation from art.5 or otherderogable articles is sought, other methods of evading their strictures may be explored.One such method takes the form of liberty-invading non-trial-based executive measures. Clearly, suchmeasures tend to be in tension with domestic and international human rights law, but they have often beenpresented as reconcilable with them, via downgrading recalibrations of human rights, as was necessitatedby control orders, and similar measures, which have recently spread from the UK to other contractingstates. The UK was the first European state to introduce such measures, but recently, as pointed out byAmnesty International in a report concerning counter-terror measures in 14 European countries,1 a numberof other Member States have followed suit, or are about to do so. The report found that the adoption ofvarious legislative measures has resulted in a downgrading of safeguards for rights to privacy, expressionand liberty across Europe, disproportionate to the terrorist threat.2 The report noted that “In a number ofstates, emergencymeasures that are supposed to be temporary have become embedded in ordinary criminallaw” contrary to the temporarily and operationally limited understanding of derogations in the context ofthe ECHR and other international human rights instruments. The report highlighted the specific issue ofcontrol orders and related measures,3 the use of citizen-stripping measures, and measures that temporarilyexclude suspected foreign fighters from the country, mentioned below.4As is well known, in the UK after the decision in A v SSHD,5 a further non-trial-based measure emergedunaccompanied by a derogation in the form of control orders applicable to suspect nationals andnon-nationals alike under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (PTA). Control orders, and the measurethat replaced them in the UK in 2011—Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Orders (TPIMs)—arenon-trial-based executive measures which have provided the model for the introduction of such measuresin a number of the ECHR contracting states in Europe. The 2017 Amnesty report criticised “the regionaltrend [in Europe] of using such measures instead of charging and prosecuting people in the criminal justicesystem”. 6 In the UK they are imposed by the Home Secretary, with court review, on a low standard ofproof and enable individuals to be subjected to significant restrictions on liberty, including house detention,but not to imprisonment. Measures on the control orders model rely on targeting terrorist suspects to curtailtheir liberty without the need for a criminal trial, by imposing specific restrictions on them, related to theparticular types of activity it is thought that they might engage in (due to previous behaviour), with theaim of preventing future terrorist activity before it occurs.Control orders as non-trial-based counter-terror measures were designed to approach or possiblyoverstep the limits of human rights law, in particular of the substantive rights to liberty under art.5 of theECHR, to private life under art.8 and to a fair trial under art.6. The courts were impliedly required toreinterpret art.5 in a minimising fashion in relation to the content of control orders and to do the same inrespect of art.6 in respect of the process of reviewing them. Minimising human rights via reinterpretation,1Amnesty International, Europe: Dangerously disproportionate: The ever-expanding national security state in Europe (17 January 2017), availableat https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur01/5342/2017/en/ [Accessed 1 August 2018].2Amnesty International, Europe: Dangerously disproportionate, p.19.3Amnesty International, Europe: Dangerously disproportionate, pp.48–56.4Amnesty International, Europe: Dangerously disproportionate, pp.62–63.5A v SSHD (2004) UKHL 56.6Amnesty International, Europe: Dangerously disproportionate, p.48.304 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsrather than openly departing from them via a derogation, implies that a re-balancing between societalneeds and individual rights should occur, in effect emptying the right of part of its content.But in response the courts relied on arts 5 and 6 of the ECHR to bring the control orders scheme intocloser compliance with their demands, meaning that the scheme itself became, in various respects, lessrepressive. However, the courts also partially acquiesced in the notion of finding that the ECHR couldaccommodate the scheme by accepting somewhat recalibrated versions of arts 5 and 6. Thus reconciliationwith human rights law was achieved by relying on a degree of recalibration of the rights, although not ofthe extensive nature demanded by the initial iteration of the scheme. In other states, schemes on the controlorders model are being introduced without being covered by a derogation. So it is worth consideringwhether such schemes do necessitate a derogation, due to the damage done to certain Strasbourg conceptsif they are introduced and operated without one.A further means of evading the ECHR guarantees arises via a citizenship-deprivation order. Relianceon citizenship deprivation to protect security is currently being introduced and explored in a range ofdemocracies, including the ECHR-contracting states. If a terrorist suspect is stripped of citizenship anddeported to a non-ECHR state (or is already in that state when the citizenship-deprivation occurs) he orshe cannot—or is less likely to be able to—rely on the ECHR against the depriving state. Use ofcitizenship-stripping has become much more prevalent in Europe (and globally) recently as an aspect ofthe escalating “war on terror” and offers another means of evading ECHR safeguards without seeking aderogation.But states have not sought to issue citizen deprivation orders against mono-nationals who are suspectedterrorists even when facing an influx of foreign terrorist fighter returnees, and even in the face of theterrorist attacks and plots in Europe in 2015–2018. In the UK, citizenship can be stripped from a nationalif his actions are “seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK”, and he is a dual national, or “theSecretary of State has reasonable grounds for believing that the person is able, under the law of a countryor territory outside the UK, to become a national of such a country or territory” under the British NationalityAct 1981.7 Therefore, persons covered by those provisions can be stripped of citizenship and have theirpassports withdrawn while inside or outside the UK.In France, the Constitutional Reform Bill 2016 considered measures for removing citizenship fromFrench mono-nationals who were convicted as terrorists in the wake of the 2015 Paris attacks. While aclear majority of MPs in the lower House of Parliament approved the measures, they were ultimatelyabandoned. Dual nationals convicted on terror charges in Belgium face losing their Belgian citizenship,while Bulgaria, Denmark, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain have similar laws.The UK has also introduced temporary exclusion orders (TEOs) under the Counter-terrorism andSecurity Act 2015, which reportedly have already been used, although sparingly. They operate on thebasis that while the TEO subject is outside the UK, he or she is outside the UK’s ECHR jurisdictionalcompetence. Therefore, if that position is correct, the state which has control over the suspect at the timewhen the TEO is imposed, not the UK, is responsible for any violations of the ECHR that occur.It is arguable that a reluctance to seek to rely on a derogation may have prompted an exploration ofthese other methods of evading the ECHR—which in some instances would also allow evasion ofnon-derogable rights. If so, that would support the case for resort to derogations more readily, the pointpursued further below.7 Section 40(4A), (s.4A(c)) after amendment by the Immigration Act 2014 s.66).Opinion 305[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors3. The contrasting role of derogations in the UK, France and Turkey in the “waron terror”For the purposes of the argument being put forward in this article, it is argued that some lessons can belearnt from the use of derogations in the UK, France and Turkey in the current “war on terror”.As is well known, in the UK, immediately post-9/11, reconciliation between reliance on a non-trial-basedmeasure and human rights law was sought by use of a derogation from art.5 of the ECHR in 2001. Thatreconciliation failed since detention without trial under Part 4 of the Anti-Terrorism Crime and SecurityAct 2001 (ACTSA) for non-national terrorist suspects was abandoned after the House of Lords invalidatedthe derogation in A v United Kingdom on grounds of proportionality, and the Strasbourg Court laterconfirmed that finding.In A v United Kingdom,8 the first test under art.15 was found to be satisfied—it was accepted, concedinga wide margin of appreciation to the state, that an emergency had been in being. But the Strasbourg Courtthen went on to consider whether the Part 4 measures had been strictly required by the exigencies of thesituation. The Court reiterated that when it comes to consider a derogation under art.15, it allows thenational authorities a wide margin of appreciation to decide on the nature and scope of the derogatingmeasures necessary to avert the emergency, but stated that it was ultimately for the Court to rule whetherthe measures were “strictly required”. The Court found that it had not been provided with any evidencewhich could persuade it to depart from the conclusion of the House of Lords that the difference in treatmentbetween suspect nationals and non-nationals was unjustified, so the measures were not found to be strictlyrequired by the exigencies of the situation.The derogation relied on by France in 2015 may be contrasted with the one in the UK on a number ofgrounds—it did not create discrimination on grounds of nationality, it was introduced in the wake ofterrorist attacks on French soil, and it was abandoned by the government after two years. France instituteda number of emergency measures (etat d’urgence) in 2015 after the Paris attacks accompanied by aderogation under art.15 of the ECHR. The Constitutional Reform Bill (to create changes to arts 16 and36) came before the Senate in France on 10 February 2016 and a clear majority of MPs in the lower Houseof Parliament approved the measures. They were intended to enshrine the state of emergency powers intothe constitution, allowing a government to call on the powers in a time of crisis. The expanded emergencypowers allowed the government to: impose immediate house arrest without authorisation from a judge,if persons were considered a risk; impose traffic restrictions, and prohibitions on public assembly; orderclosure of public spaces; requisition property; prohibit entry into or residence of certain persons; conductsearches without a judicial warrant and seize any computer files found; and to block websites deemed toglorify terrorism, without prior judicial authorisation. These powers created interferences with the rightsto liberty, security, freedom of movement, privacy, and freedoms of association and expression and sorequired the derogation under art.15. The length of the state of emergency was criticised by AmnestyInternational, but France eventually abandoned the derogation on 1 November 2017.Turkey’s recent reliance on a derogation contrasts strongly with that of France in a range of respects.A group of members of the Turkish armed forces attempted to seize power in Istanbul on 15–16 July 2016.The attempted coup involved soldiers in an attack on several key state buildings, including Parliamentand the Presidential compound, and the Chief of General Staff was captured and taken as a hostage.9 Itwas reported that more than 300 people were killed during the coup and 2,500 people were injured. TheTurkish government alleged that the coup attempt was linked to FetullahGülen and allegedlymaster-mindedby the Gulenist terrorist group. On 21 July 2016 the government declared a national state of emergencypursuant to art.120 of the Turkish Constitution of 1982 to last for three months, which has subsequentlybeen extended. Subsequently, Turkey formally notified the Council of Europe that it intended to derogate8A v United Kingdom (2009) 49 E.H.R.R. 29.9Mehmet Hasan Altan v Turkey (App. No.13237/17), judgment of 20 March 2018 at [15].306 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsfrom the ECHR under art.15 but, unusually, no specific measure was identified in the notice, such asdetention without trial, and no article of the Convention was identified as having been derogated from.10In two cases in 2018, Mehmet and Sahin v Turkey11 the Strasbourg Court found that “the attemptedmilitary coup and its aftermath have posed severe dangers to the democratic constitutional order andhuman rights, amounting to a threat to the life of the nation” and, noting the broad margin of appreciationaccorded to the state in relation to the judgement that such a threat existed, accepted that the derogationwas relevant to its assessment of the merits of the applicant’s complaint.12 The Court in Mehmet and inSahin reaffirmed the approach to the margin of appreciation and the stance taken as to the question ofwhether the measures taken were “strictly required” in A v United Kingdom. Mehmet and Sahin were bothjournalists who were critical of the government. Both applicants were subject to criminal proceedings onthe basis of contravention of art.309 of the Criminal Code—attempting to overthrow the constitutionalorder—due to their alleged connections and sympathies with the Gulenist movement, despite there beingno evidence linking them to the coup attempt, or to active participation in the movement. Mehmet hadbeen held in pre-trial detention for over a year prior to being sentenced to life imprisonment (subject toongoing appeals) and Sahin had been held for a similar period, although his trial had yet to be heard atthe time of the Court judgment. Both Mehmet and Sahin involved claims of compensation for a lengthyperiod of pre-trial detention. The Turkish Constitutional Court, taking a stance similar to that of the Houseof Lords in the UK in A, had also accepted that there was a “public emergency” within the terms of art.15,but had also gone on to find that that the measures were not strictly required by the exigencies of thesituation. Since the derogation was found to be invalid domestically, a violation of the applicants’ art.5(1)rights was found in both cases.The European Court of Human Rights had regard to these findings. Unlike A v United Kingdom,however, in which the UK’s derogation referred to specific measures of pre-trial detention, in Mehmetand Sahin the derogation did not refer to such measures. Another crucial distinction is that inMehmet andSahin there was limited evidence that the two applicants had had any involvement in terrorist activity,and therefore the Court found that the pre-trial detention was not “lawful”, nor effected “in accordancewith a procedure prescribed by law” due to the lack of reasonable suspicion, and thus could not “be saidto have been strictly required by the exigencies of the situation”.13 So the derogation was not found tojustify the treatment of the applicants in Sahin orMehmet, as the measures taken were not “strictly requiredby the exigencies of the situation”. The Court thus found violations of art.5. In this regard the EuropeanCourt agreed with the Constitutional Court’s finding in relation to art.5(1) that “if it were accepted thatpeople could be placed in pre-trial detention without any strong evidence that they had committed anoffence, the guarantees of the right to liberty and security would be meaningless”. 14InMehmet and in Sahin the European Court of Human Rights also considered the question of whetherthe interference with the applicants’ art.10 (freedom of expression) rights was justified as a measure“strictly necessary” due to the exigencies of the situation. This issue was raised because the impositionof pre-trial detention had been linked explicitly to both applicants’ critical statements about the governmentin relation to the events leading up to and in response to the coup. The Court considered that:“… even in a state of emergency—which is, as the Constitutional Court noted, a legal regime whoseaim is to restore the normal regime by guaranteeing fundamental rights … the Contracting Statesmust bear in mind that any measures taken should seek to protect the democratic order from the10Mehmet (App. No.13237/17) at [81].11 Sahin Alpay v Turkey (App. No.16538/17), judgment of 20 March 2018.12Mehmet (App. No.13237/17) at [92]; Sahin (App. No.16538/17) at [76].13Mehmet (App. No.13237/17) at [140]; Sahin (App. No.16538/17) at [119].14Mehmet (App. No.13237/17) at [36]; Sahin (App. No.16538/17) at [32].Opinion 307[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthreats to it, and every effort must be made to safeguard the values of a democratic society, such aspluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness.”15The Court observed that detention of journalists in part for publication of articles and providingcommentary created a “chilling effect” on the press. The Court therefore found a violation of art.10 inboth cases. The Court awarded non-pecuniary compensation to the victims due to the lack of evidencethat either applicant was associated with terrorism or otherwise with violent opposition to the state. Theapplicants inMehmet and Sahin were granted €21,500 in non-pecuniary damages.It is clear that the actions taken in Turkey, including arresting and imprisoning thousands of academics,civil servants and journalists, could not be covered by a derogation from arts 5 or 10, as the StrasbourgCourt found in the 2018 cases considered, because they are clearly disproportionate to the threat in question.So it appears that Turkey is no longer adhering to the ECHR in a range of respects, and although it hasopenly declared that that is the case via the derogation, its engagement with the demands of art.15, andof the ECHR in general, may be viewed as a tokenistic one. The situation is precisely the one that art.15was designed to avoid. So while the vast majority of the ECHR-contracting states have not sought aderogation in the face of the “war on terror”, the only derogation currently in existence in a contractingstate relates instead to an attempted internal coup and shows little allegiance to ECHR values.4. Why have states largely avoided reliance on derogations?If further states had sought derogations in the last five years from art.5 to cover detention without trial,or to introduce lengthy periods of house arrest likely to create a “deprivation of liberty”, the StrasbourgCourt would have been likely to uphold them, provided the measures were compatible with the state’sother international legal obligations, depending on the precise measures introduced, given the relativeease with which it is possible to satisfy the jurisprudence governing the tests under art.15. The Court hastended to defer to the state’s judgment as to the existence of a state of emergency (the first question underart.15). Initially it appeared, as evidenced in certain decisions, such as Brannigan v United Kingdom,16that the Court would take the view that the margin of appreciation conceded would not differ in respectof the second question regarding proportionality. So the margin of appreciation conceded at Strasbourgon the “emergency” point meant that it was hard to challenge the state’s view as to the measures neededto combat the threat, and in most cases, until recently, once the emergency point was conceded, so wasthe point as to the measures needed to combat the emergency. But in more recent cases—Aksoy v Turkey17and A v United Kingdom—a change in that stance became apparent and the margin appears to havenarrowed at the second step, enabling the Court to come to a judgment differing from that of the MemberState. That stance was then confirmed in Sahin Alpay v Turkey andMehmet Hasan Altan v Turkey in 2018.The Court is showing a greater determination to scrutinise the measures taken; it is subjecting them to amore intensive review, having reduced the margin conceded on this issue. A divide between the width ofthe margin conceded as to making a determination as to an “emergency” and themargin conceded regardingthe proportionality analysis is apparent.It is possible that the reluctance of the contracting states to seek derogations from the ECHR post 9/11,even in the face of the increase in terrorist activity in Europe in 2015–2018, may have been influencedby the diminished deference shown in the case of A v United Kingdom (and perhaps to a lesser extent bythat of Aksoy v Turkey, in which the measures also failed the proportionality test). That stance of theStrasbourg Court, evident in A v United Kingdom in 2004, and its counterpart decision at Strasbourg in2010, may have sent a signal to the other states that use of derogations can be risky and—since they may15Mehmet (App. No.13237/17) at [210]; Sahin (App. No.16538/17) at [180].16Brannigan v United Kingdom (1994) 17 E.H.R.R. 539.17Aksoy v Turkey (1997) 23 E.H.R.R. 553.308 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsbe invalidated—de-stabilising to counter-terror efforts. If, combined with reluctance to rely on a derogation,other methods of evading or minimising the ECHR guarantees are available, the basis for seeking aderogation could appear to be undermined. Clearly, that suggestion must be treated with caution since ifno derogation is in place, counter-terror measures can be tested directly against the standards maintainedunder the relevant ECHR guarantees, which can also be de-stabilising to counter-terror efforts. But theperception that derogations are of value to the Member States in aiding in combatting terrorism appearsto have undergone some revision, and it would be strange if that was not connected to the recent adoptionof stricter scrutiny of proportionality under art.15 at Strasbourg.A further reason for a reluctance to seek a derogation in the Member States may be due to fear ofreputational damage and of handing a propaganda victory to ISIS and similar groups. If the “war on terror”relies on maintenance of a moral difference between a state and terrorist groups that threaten it, then anannouncement that human rights are to be partially abandoned may appear to fail to aid that enterprise.The risk that a derogation might be invalidated would add a further concern: unsuccessful reliance on aderogation, as found in A v United Kingdom, would create even greater reputational damage.5. The case for resorting to derogations more readilyAlthough the risk of terror attacks may be overstated by governments and the media, and the human rightsof suspects can be portrayed as needlessly interfering with a state’s ability to combat terrorism, that hasnot led in the last five years to a rush in most of the contracting states to deploy derogations to introducethe most draconian measures. The existence of a state of emergency is a necessary precondition forderogation—it does not mandate it, and a state which seeks to adhere to the Convention, despite the factthat it could probably defend a derogation at Strasbourg, may be said to deserve credit for doing so.However, if in the absence of a derogation other methods of evading the ECHR are resorted to, the optionof openly declaring that certain ECHR standards are not being maintained, on a temporary basis, maycreate less damage to human rights in the long run. In other words, if art.15 is relied on in a manner thattakes its demands seriously, and with a view to returning to normal human rights standards as quickly aspossible, as was arguably the case in France (and reiterated inMehmet and in Sahin), resort to a derogationmay have advantages over more stealthy departures from rights’ standards.So it is argued that current counter-terrorism debate needs to consider more openly the impact ofnon-trial-based liberty-invading measures as one aspect of the solution to the current terrorist threat inorder to question whether there is a case for openly seeking a derogation to protect such measures. Itshould be asked whether, given the principles underlying the current conception of international humanrights law, the cost of relying on such measures without a derogation from art.5 is out of proportion totheir value, since in particular they tend to lead to recalibration of the concept of “deprivation of liberty”.There is a case for contending that such measures should be covered by a derogation, which also requiresthat they should be non-discriminatory and proportionate to the specific threat emanating from membersand supporters of ISIS and similar groups, as well as from far-right secular groups. In general, relianceon a derogation is more transparent than relying on the other methods considered here of reconciling suchmeasures with human rights law, and less likely to lead to normalisation of such measures. A derogationmust be openly declared and therefore is less insidious in eroding rights-adherence than the stealthyavoidance of human rights laws via recalibrations of rights or by seeking to place suspects outside thearea of a state’s jurisdictional responsibility.Use of a derogation would also show respect for the mechanisms that international human rights lawhas provided for crisis situations, for use even against a state’s own citizens. Availability of derogationsunder the ECHR (and other international human rights’ instruments) means that states are encouraged,even when facing crisis situations, to remain within the ECHR system rather than considering withdrawal.Opinion 309[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsBut the derogation is still policed by the Court, and, as seen in Aksoy, A v United Kingdom, Mehmet andSahin, is not always accepted.Reliance on derogations when a state is or perceives itself to be in a state of emergency arguably meansthat the actions of the state still retain legitimacy (including satisfying the needs of transparency) since itcan only derogate to the extent, and for the period of time, that will satisfy the demands of proportionalityunder art.15, and that judgment is likely ultimately to be made by the Strasbourg Court. If a derogationwas continued after the point when the state of emergency had diminished, those demands would notcontinue to be satisfied. But reliance on derogations means adhering to transparency and proportionalityas demanded by art.15—the converse of the current position Turkey appears to be in in relation to art.15and the ECHR in general. Turkey has purported to remain within the Convention system by relying on aderogation, but the connection between the emergency caused by the attempted military coup and thewidespread arrest and detention of journalists, academics and others apparently linked to Gulenism is notapparent. Even if it was apparent, such arrests would not be viewed as a proportionate response to theemergency, while the purported derogation appeared to be intended to obscure rather than reveal adherenceto the ECHR.6. ConclusionsDespite the advantages of the use of derogations, this piece has explored the question why, in the face ofthe current and increasing terrorist threat in Europe, derogations have not on the whole been sought, sothey have not played a pivotal role in the “war on terror” in Europe. As discussed, reliance on evasion orrecalibration of the ECHR guarantees may lead to protracted court action, continued tension with humanrights law and an insidious undermining of respect for such law in the UK and elsewhere. Thus, art.15 isnot fulfilling the role it was originally intended to have, since it is either largely being sidelined in the“war on terror”, or misused as in Turkey at the present time.So this article has put the case for the open use of derogations as opposed to the use of more covertmethods of evading the impact of the ECHR. It acknowledges that so doing could encourage the use ofmore repressive measures (so long as the demands of proportionality were met) and would not necessarilyinhibit states from embracing the use of measures such as citizenship-stripping, but at the least it asks thatdebate as to the role of art.15 in the current situation, and in future, should be initiated.310 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsPoint of ViewBrexit, Human Rights and Self-determination—aPerfect Storm in the British Crown Dependenciesand Overseas Territories?Susie Alegre*Brexit; British overseas territories; Constitutional law; Crown dependencies; European DevelopmentFund; European Union; Human rights; Self-determinationAs the UK tears itself apart over Brexit, scrapping the human rights protections in the EU Charter andlimiting the powers of Parliament in a bid to “take back control,” we should not forget that the ripples ofBrexit reach far beyond the shores of Britain. The UK is responsible for the international obligations ofthree Crown Dependencies and 14 Overseas Territories (CDOTs) around the world. Their citizens are allBritish but, except for Gibraltar, because they have never been part of the European Union, they wereexcluded from voting in the referendum despite the impact the result would have on them.Each CDOT is unique in its historical, geographical, social and cultural make-up and this has influencedthe different ways they have developed their relationships with the UK and Europe. Some rely oninternational arrangements to function as financial centres or to sell their produce into the European Union,others rely on UK and European development aid to help keep them sustainable. Some are geographicallyEuropean like the Isle of Man; the Channel Islands; Akrotiri and Dehekelia; and Gibraltar. Others are farfrom Europe in the Caribbean, or isolated in the Pacific and South Atlantic with complex historical identitiesand interests. It is impossible to generalise about the CDOTs, but one thing they do have in common isthat, through Brexit, they have lost their voice.The Overseas Territories are, in many ways, the last remnants of Britain’s imperial past. Those withpermanent resident populations are classified as “non-self-governing territories” for the purposes of theUN Charter1 and the Special Committee on Decolonisation2. The UK has assumed the responsibility forthese territories recognising“the principle that the interests of the inhabitants of these territories are paramount, and accept[ing]as a sacred trust the obligation to promote to the utmost, within the system of international peace andsecurity established by the present Charter, the well-being of the inhabitants of these territories, and,to this end:a. to ensure, with due respect for the culture of the peoples concerned, their political, economic,social, and educational advancement, their just treatment, and their protection against abuses;b. to develop self-government, to take due account of the political aspirations of the peoples,and to assist them in the progressive development of their free political institutions, accordingto the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and their varying stages ofadvancement;”3*Associate Tenant, Doughty Street Chambers and Director, Island Rights Institute.1Charter of the United Nations (UN Charter), Ch.

But they have a significant amountof independence internally and in recent years, the UK has supported the development of their internationalidentity. In a framework for developing the international identity of the Isle of Man4 signed in 2007 theUK committed to not acting internationally on behalf of the Islandwithout prior consultation and recognised,in particular, that the interests of the Island may differ from the interests of the UK in relation to the EU.Gibraltarians were able to vote in the referendum and voted over 96% in favour of remaining in theEU—a reflection of the importance of the EU to their society and their livelihoods. Shortly after the vote,the Chief Minister of Gibraltar said that a hard Brexit was an “existential threat to Gibraltar’s economy”.5The fate of the thousands of workers who cross the border with Spain on a daily basis and their contributionto life on the rock still remains unclear.For those in Overseas Territories who did not get to vote, the impact of Brexit on their rights and theirability to sustain themselves may be equally dramatic. The Falkland Islands have seen new threats to theirsecurity as a result of Brexit with Argentina sensing that Britain may lose the support of the EuropeanUnion for its control of the islands.6 Their fishing industry, which accounts for 41% of their economy andtwo-thirds of the corporation tax they collect, relies almost entirely on tariff free access to the EU marketwith 94% of their products being sold in the EU.7 Other territories that rely on aid from the EU and theUK to sustain themselves and provide basic services like health and social care to their populations suchas St Helena, Montserrat and Pitcairn will see their aid budgets cut significantly when they are no longereligible for EU development aid as overseas countries and territories of the EU. Under the 11th EuropeanDevelopment Fund British Overseas Territories will receive a total of 76.8 million Euros until 2020. Forsmall communities development funding may be crucial for their continued viability. After Brexit thespecial relationship will be broken and it remains to be seen how the UK will plug the financial gap toensure it fulfils its obligations to guarantee the economic, social and cultural rights of its citizens in thoseterritories.And yet, the interests of the CDOTs were not taken into account in the decision to hold a referendumon UKmembership of the EU despite the obvious impact it would have on them. This is not just a questionof politics; it is an issue that will fundamentally affect their rights, including the economic, social andcultural rights, of people in the CDOTs in some ways more acutely than it will those in the UK. The scaleof small island economies means that they are more vulnerable to shocks and less able to diversify. TheirGovernments understand this, but their input has been minimal.The right to self-determination is a core principle of international law arising out of customaryinternational law and recognised in the United Nations Charter8 and the International Covenants on Civiland Political Rights and Economic Social and Cultural Rights.9 It is the right of all peoples to define theirdestiny in the international order and it has increasingly been recognised as including “internal”self-determination and intra-State relations.The peoples of the British CDOTs have their own governments and the UK has a responsibility tosupport them in the development of their right to self-determination. But while the UK has dedicated timeand effort to supporting the internal constitutional development of the OTs with the introduction in recent4 Statement of intent agreed on 11 January 2006, the Chief Minister of the Isle of Man and the UK Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs,https://www.gov.im/media/622895/iominternationalidentityframework.pdf [Accessed 1 August 2018].5A.

But for some, remaining British without the benefits ofEU citizenship and special access to the EU, may be a very different proposition. And Brexit is not theonly issue that has moved the right to self-determination up the political agenda in CDOTs.In May of this year Westminster passed the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 whichgave the British Government powers to require Overseas Territories to introduce publicly accessibleregisters of the beneficial ownership of companies if they have failed to do so by the end of 2020.10Interestingly, these powers applied only to Overseas Territories, not Crown Dependencies. It has beenargued that this was due to the different constitutional relationships the UK has with its CrownDependencieswhich would make it impossible to legislate in this way for them without sparking a constitutional crisis.11However, in those Overseas Territories in the Caribbeanmost acutely affected, there have been allegationsthat this distinction has more to do with the fact that the Crown Dependencies are European than any realconstitutional difference.12Douglas Parnell, the Chairman of the ruling party in the Turks and Caicos Islands said“…. this action highlights for us as a people the attitude towards us. If it suits their interests, an Orderin Council is easily passed. Our constitution is an Order in Council and could just as easily be changedif there was the political will in the UK. It is time that we seriously consider a different, moreempowering relationship with the UK. This should be seen for what it is – a constitutional smackdown by our overseers …”13And the Deputy Prime Minister of the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Dr Kedrick Pickering, addressinga crowd protesting about the legislation said BVI was “declaring war” on the UK, spoke of the need todiscuss divorce from the UK and called for experts from across the world to consider new constitutionaloptions for the BVI separate from the UK.14 Their concerns were reflected in the recent Joint MinisterialCouncil meeting in London where the OTs put the question of their constitutional relationship with theUK firmly on the agenda with assertions that the recent action of the “UK Parliament to impose legislationon the OTs was undemocratic, a step backwards and a clear contradiction to UK policy statements andcommitments to the OTs and the UN.”15For some OTs, this incursion on their sovereignty represents a tipping point. As the benefits of beingBritish become less clear against the backdrop of Brexit, with the loss of EU citizenship and preferentialaccess to EU markets, it seems likely that the constitutional fallout of the decision to leave the EU maynot be restricted to relationships between the “home countries” in the UK.

It will show that theidentity of the applicant himself, of the state, as well as the political context, have made possible this firstuse, rather than it being the consequence of a new strategy adopted by the Committee of Ministers. It willconclude that the European Court of Human Rights is being used here as one of the last bastions indefending the credibility of the Council of Europe in the context of the biggest scandal the organisationhas ever faced.For the first time since it was set up in 2010, the Committee of Ministers decided, on 5 December 2017,to launch infringements proceedings against Azerbaijan1 under art.46(4) of the European Convention onHuman Rights (ECHR), due to the authorities’ persistent refusal to releaseMr IlgarMammadov followingjudgment delivered by the European Court of Human Rights in 2014. Imprisoned since 4 February 2013,the applicant was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment on 17 March 2014 under arts 220.1 (massdisorder) and 315.2 (resistance to or violence against public officials, posing a threat to their life or health)of the criminal code.The purpose of this article is to explore how it has been possible to launch the infringement proceedingsfor first time. Does it mean a more offensive and punitive strategy adopted by the Committee of Ministerswith regard to the implementation of the European Court’s judgments? Rather, this analysis will showthat the identity of the applicant himself, of the state, as well as the political context have made possiblethis first use. It will conclude that the Court is being used here as one of the last bastions in defending thecredibility of the Council of Europe, in the context of the biggest scandal the organisation has ever faced.I. The IlgarMammadov case and the refusal of a full compliance by the authoritiesThe applicant has been detained since 2013 following protests in the town of Ismayilli, and, on 17 March2014, was condemned by the Sheki Court of Serious Crimes to a seven-year prison sentence because ofhis conviction of mass disorder and violence against public officials.

The Court also made it clear that it was called to “examine whether the deprivation of theapplicant’s liberty during the pre-trial period was justified” (at [100]). The Court ordered the respondentstate to pay the applicant €20,000 (the exact amount he had claimed) in respect of non-pecuniary damage,without recommending any other measure.A. Constant position adopted by the Committee of MinistersThe Committee has always shared the view that:“The violations found by the Court, in particular that of Article 18 taken in conjunction with Article5, cast doubt on the merits of the criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant and that itfollows that the authorities are required to ensure the applicant’s immediate release and to adopt theother individual measures necessary to erase for him the consequences of the violations.”3The case has been placed under enhanced supervision because of the complex problem and urgentindividual measure. Three regular interim resolutions called for the authorities to release Ilgar Mammadovand adopt general measures using a crescendo word register. In the Interim Resolution of March 2015,4the Committee, concerned about the decision of the Supreme Court to postpone sine die its decision,“reiterated with insistence its call to the authorities to ensure without further delay the applicant’s release…”. In the second interim resolution of 20155 the words are different: the executive body now recalls theobligation of each Member State under art.3 of the Statute of the Council of Europe, “called on theauthorities of the Member States and the Secretary General to raise the applicant’s situation with thehighest authorities in Azerbaijan in order to get him released”, and “invited the observer States to theCouncil of Europe and international organisations to do the same”. In the interim resolution adopted inJune 2016,6 the Committee decided to examine the applicant’s situation at each of its regular and humanrights meetings until Ilgar Mammadov is released. It recalled that: “It is intolerable that, in a State subjectto the rule of law, a person should continue to be deprived of his liberty on the basis of proceedingsengaged, in breach of the Convention, with a view to punishing him for having criticised the government”.It also stated that: “the Committee’s resolve to ensure, with all means available to the Organisation,Azerbaijan’s compliance with its obligations under this judgment”.On 20 September 2016, the Court communicated the second application brought by Ilgar Mammadovto the government.B. Partial compliance and arguments used by the Azerbaijani authoritiesThe Azerbaijani authorities submitted a first action plan on 26 November 20147 (just within the six-monthpost-judgment time-limit), but the content was quite deceptive, with references only to training sessionsand the announcement of the examination of the applicant’s cassation appeal.8 More than 26 months after2 “The restrictions permitted under this Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other than those for whichthey have been prescribed.”3Council of Europe, CM/Notes/1273/H46-3, 9 December 2016.

The completion of the criminal proceedings on 18 November 2016 before the Supreme Court did not result in the applicant’s release:Council of Europe, CM/Notes/1273/H46-3, 9 December 2016, 1273rd Meeting, analysis of the Secretariat, p.5.326 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthis submission, and one month after a visit by the Secretary General using the art.52 enquiry procedure,a revised action plan was submitted. The updated action plan9 mentions a 10 February 2017 executiveorder by the president of Azerbaijan to prevent arbitrary arrests and “which foresees the elaboration withintwo months of draft laws notably on: the decriminalisation of certain crimes, in particular in the economicfield; a greater recourse to alternatives to imprisonment” and a “wider application of substitution ofremainder of imprisonments by lighter punishment, parole and suspended sentence”.10 Consequently, theSecretariat noted that “the recent adoption of the Presidential Executive Order appears to be a promisingdevelopment”.11 Furthermore, the government’s refusal to release the applicant is based on two grounds.First, the Court has neither recommended nor ordered the applicant’s release as it did in other cases.The just satisfaction (€20,000) was paid to the applicant on 25 December 2014 to cover non-pecuniarydamage. Nevertheless, the previous practice has shown that such recommendations made by the Courtare sporadic and do not follow a well-structured or systematic approach, something which has beencriticised. Thus the payment of just satisfaction which was made does not necessarily compensate thewhole damage suffered by Ilgar Mammadov.Secondly, for the authorities:“The violation of Article 18 taken in conjunction with Article 5 found by the Court concerned theapplicant’s arrest and pre-trial detention and they recalled that a second application, concerning theapplicant’s conviction, was currently pending before the Court.”12In fact, the Court recently delivered the second Ilgar Mammadov judgment13 and concluded that aviolation of art.6(1) had occurred, as the criminal proceedings did not comply with the guarantees of afair trial. Once more it is highly regrettable, having in mind the context of the second judgment, that theChamber only ordered the government to pay €10,000 to the victim.14 The applicant’s representatives havealso omitted to ask the Court to recommend his release in the operative part of the judgment. Yet thechamber has cautiously not referred the issue to the Grand Chamber (although a crucial question on theapplicability of arts 18 and 6 combined was raised) probably not to delay Ilgar Mammadov’s release. Sofar, however, the government’s response has not changed. For the Committee of Ministers, the obligationto release the applicant after the first judgment cannot be disputed and so the executive body would nothave seized the Court under art.46(3) of the ECHR to ask the Court to interpret the previous judgment.Other similar cases, where the Court found a violation of arts 5 and 18 and where the applicant wasreleased, can be called on to serve as good practice for other states. It is crucial to refer here to the Lutsenkov Ukraine case where the Court found violations of arts 5 and 18, as the applicant’s detention was aimedat punishing him for publicly disagreeing with accusations against him. Being arrested on 27 December2010, the applicant was paid €15,000 for non-pecuniary damage on 17 January 2013, more than six monthsafter the Court’s judgment, and he finally benefited from the President’s pardon on 7 April 2013. TheSecretary General of the Council of Europe noted that “[i]t follows the spirit of the judgment of theEuropean Court of Human Rights”, although the Court had only ordered the payment of just satisfaction.15The Jafarov case will be mentioned as another example later in this article.9Council of Europe, DH-DD(2017)172.10Council of Europe, CM/Notes/1280/H46-2, 10 March 2017, 1280th DH meeting.11Council of Europe, CM/Notes/1280/H46-2, 10 March 2017, 1280th DH meeting.12Council of Europe, CM/Notes/1294/H46-2, 22 September 2017, 1294th meeting.13 Ilgar Mammadov v Azerbaijan (No.2) (App. No.919/15) judgment of 16 November 2017.14The joint concurring opinion made by four judges only discusses the applicability of art.18 and not the issue under art.46.15 Lutsenko v Ukraine (App. No.492/11) judgment of 3 July 2012, and status of execution available at: http://hudoc.exec.coe.int/eng#{%22EXECIdentifier%22:[%22004-32285%22] [Accessed 1 August 2018].The First Infringements Proceedings within the European System of Human Rights 327[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsII. First use of infringement proceedings: why has it been made possible?Is the first use of infringement proceedings the result of a new strategy adopted by the Committee to dealwith unimplemented serious cases? This part will show that, on the contrary, the rationale for theproceedings is not part of a broader strategy, but is instead on the facts of the case.A. The Ilgar Mammadov case: not just any common applicantIlgar Mammadov is an emblematic figure for the Council of Europe. He has extensively collaborated withvarious actors and bodies at the Council of Europe. He was appointed the director of the Council of EuropeSchool of Political Studies in Baku. Moreover, he has not only been the chairman of the oppositionRepublicanAlternative (REAL) party, but also a presidential candidate in 2013 and is a potential presidentialcandidate for the coming elections in October 2018. Thus he is considered as one of the main outspokencritics of the Aliyev government.16 Ilgar Mammadov has regularly directly written to the department ofthe execution of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (not a common practice), his lettersbeing transmitted by his representative under r.9 of the article 46 Rules of the Committee.B. Azerbaijan: the worst country in terms of its compliance rate with the judgments ofthe European Court of Human RightsMore broadly, selecting a case against Azerbaijan was the fairest and most indisputable choice tomake—here figures speak for themselves. Out of the 194 Azerbaijan cases transmitted for supervision tothe Committee, only three have been closed so far by final resolutions.17 By contrast with the other 46countries, checking all the country factsheets and calculating the average rate of compliance for each stateand all the states together,18 Azerbaijan is indisputably the worst country in terms of average compliancewith an incredible percentage of 1.5%, the second worst being Ukraine (14.28%), followed by Republicof Moldova (22.72%), Albania (23.53%) and Russian Federation (26.53%).19 The average for the 47countries amounts to 72.62%.20 Azerbaijan is now in the top seven countries in terms of pending casesbefore the European Court of Human Rights.21 With a population of less than 10 million people, it accountsfor about 1.2% of the population of the 47 Member States of the Council of Europe but has 4% of thepending cases before the Committee of Ministers.22C. Lacking convergent external pressureThe fact that IlgaMammadov has been a political leader has undoubtedly served to crystallise internationalmobilisation. NGOs have relayed the call to release the applicant.23 There has also been a request by the16Article 19 and Sport for Rights, “Full-throttle attack on human rights, What reporters of F1 Baku Grand Prix should know” (June 2016), p.13,https://www.article19.org/data/files/medialibrary/38402/a19_full_throttle_azerbaijan_FINAL.pdf [Accessed 1 August 2018].17One in 2012, one in 2013 and one in 2015. 181 cases were pending in 2017: factsheet on Azerbaijan: https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/CP_Azerbaijan_ENG.pdf [Accessed 1 August 2018].18 See https://www.coe.int/en/web/execution/country-factsheets, last update 1 October 2017 [Accessed 1 August 2018].19Seven countries have a proportion of compliance worse than 50%; unsurprisingly five of these seven countries (Azerbaijan, Hungary, Italy, RussianFederation and Ukraine) are in the top worst records before the European Court of Human Rights in terms of pending cases.20Twenty-eight out of the 47 countries are over the average of 72.62%. Fifteen states are over 90%, the top countries being: Andorra (100%),Denmark (97.05%), France (96.32%), Luxembourg (100%), Norway (100%), Sweden (97.22%) and the UK (96.31%). The statistics are the author’sand are drawn from the numbers available on the website dedicated to the implementation of the judgments.21European Court of Human Rights, Statistics for 2017, Hungary, Romania, Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Italy and Azerbaijan account for 77.9% ofthe pending cases, http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Stats_pending_2017_BIL.pdf [Accessed 1 August 2018].22Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers, 10th Annual Report (2016), p.64.23 Joint statement, 24 June 2015, online, Human Rights House.org. More recently, Report issued on 3 April 2017, “Nations in Transit2017—Azerbaijan”, http://www.refworld.org [Accessed 1 August 2018]. On a rate of 1 to 7 (7 being the worst), the democratic score has constantlybeen depreciated/downgraded from 6.00 in 2008 to 6.57 in 2012 and 6.93 in 2017.328 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCivic Solidarity Platform and the Sports for Rights Coalition to launch infringement proceedings.24 A billwas also adopted by the US Congress entitled “Azerbaijan Democracy Act of 2015”, with sanctions beingenvisaged until notably “Azerbaijan has made significant progress in … the release of individuals inAzerbaijan who have been jailed based on political or religious beliefs or expression”.25 The issue wasraised before the UK Parliament in 2016 and it appears that the situation of Ilgar Mammadov has beenraised several times at ministerial level during bilateral meetings.26 The UN has also regularly criticisedthe human rights situation in Azerbaijan.27Nevertheless, external pressure has not always been constant or unanimous. Since mid-2017, there hasbeen renewed “pressure of the West on the regime” after “a long peaceful pause” from mid-2016 tomid-2017 “in exchange for promises of various reforms”.28 The Azerbaijani authorities had also tried touse the political context of war against Muslim extremists and war against Armenia on the disputedNagorno-Karabakh territory to defer pressure. More importantly, by contrast to what has happened inprevious cases, not much pressure has been exerted by the EU. The dialogue, frozen since 2012, wasreopened in February 2017, with the desire to negotiate a new partnership agreement to enhance politicaland economic ties in order to replace the 1999 Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.Azerbaijan “uses” a few arguments, notably that it “is an important actor in ensuring energy securityof Europe as an alternative to Russian gas and oil” and that it “is a stabilising force balancing out Russian,Iranian, and radical Islamic influences in the region”.29 Some calls were launched by NGOs30 to the EUleaders to raise human rights concerns. Yet, a press release dated 20 December 2017, after mentioningthat “Azerbaijan is an important partner for the European Union”, briefly mentions that “the EU hascontinued to call for Azerbaijan to comply with judgments of the European Court of Human Rights”.31Thus, the EU has ignored the invitation launched by the Committee of Ministers, notably to internationalorganisations, “to raise the applicant’s situation with the highest authorities in Azerbaijan to get himreleased”.32 Thus external pressure cannot have been an impetus for a new strategy adopted in this case.D. Consistent and permanent pressure by the various actors of the Council of Europe:A question of credibility for the ECHR system33A unanimous internal pressure from the bodies at the Council of Europe needs to be noted, although noconcerted and coordinated declarations or activities were conducted. These various actors have alwaysensured they were pushing in the same direction, which they did.The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe used to be a strong advocate for betterimplementation of judgments. For reasons which will be clarified in the following part, the Assembly hasnow been much more cautious. In a document issued on 25 September 201734 and prepared by AlainDestexhe, who had to resign a few days before its adoption, being accused of being part of the “caviar24 “Azerbaijan: time for Justice for Ilgar Mammadov”, 22 May 2017, http://iphronline.org/azerbaijan-time-justice-ilgar-mammadov.html [Accessed1 August 2018].25HR 4262, 114th Congress (2015–2016),s.6, https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4262?r=55 [Accessed 1 August 2018]. s.6.Sections 4 and 5 detail the sanctions which include “Denial of entry into the United States of senior leadership of the Government of Azerbaijan andothers”, “Prohibition on loans and investment” and “Blocking of assets and other prohibited activities”.26See http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Lords/2016-05-04/HL8201 [Accessed1 August 2018].27A/HRC/34/52/Add.3, 20 February 2017, para.112.

It also called for MrMammadov’s release (para.17). Some Parliamentarians put forward a dissenting opinion to this report,an exceptional situation at the Parliamentary Assembly, “raising concerns about the independence andobjectivity of the rapporteur”. Strong amendments to the resolution were finally adopted by the largemajority.38 Unsurprisingly, only the Bureau of the Assembly “calls on High Contracting Parties to theECHR to apply, as soon as possible, the procedure foreseen under Article 46(4) of the Convention” on13 September 2017.39The strongest and the most crucial mobilisation came from the Secretary General. On 3 August 2015,he sent a letter to the Azerbaijani authorities regarding his concern about two physical assaults by fellowdetainees. Ilgar Mammadov had been the victim of assault and required treatment in detention “fully inline with the standards of the Council of Europe”. Incidentally, at the end of the letter, the SecretaryGeneral “take(s) the opportunity to recall the necessity of ensuring that the decision of the European Courtof Human Rights with regard to Ilgar Mammadov be fully and effectively implemented without delay”.40But a crucial turning point then occurred that coincided with revelations and credible suspicions of the“caviar diplomacy” having impacted the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. First, theSecretary General decided to use the art.52 inquiry procedure on 13 October 2015 in order “to seekexplanations from the authorities concerning the country’s implementation of the Human RightsConvention”.41 Consequently, on 11 January 2017, the Secretary General visited Baku, and an action planwas received on 14 February 2017 addressing requirements (as to the general measures) under thejudgment.42 Secondly, for the first time in the history of the organisation, on 13 September 2017, he “calledon the member states of the Council of Europe to support an article 46(4) ECHR infringement procedureagainst Azerbaijan”,43 should the applicant’s situation remain unchanged.44 It is also worth mentioningthat a Focal Point on reprisals has been set up within his cabinet, a system that also operates in the UnitedNations.E. Beyond the Mammadov case: a question of credibility for the Council of Europe itselfWell beyond the Ilgar Mammadov case, even well beyond all the other cases that Azerbaijan has notcomplied with, this case has become a test case not only of the credibility of the ECHR system, but also35A.

The “Azerbaijani Laundromat”has now been widely documented.50 One of the notorious victims of this caviar diplomacy at theParliamentary Assembly was Strasser, the rapporteur on political prisoners in Azerbaijan, who was refuseda visa three times to visit the country (an unprecedented fact at the Assembly) and was then criticised forrelying on NGOs’ reports and other data in his report. The January 2013 vote on this report for theAzerbaijani regime “was a triumph. For human rights activists in Baku, it was a disaster”. IlgarMammadovwas arrested on 4 February 2013, “a few days after the vote in Strasbourg”.51Therefore, a written Declaration (the Omtzigt-Schwabe declaration) on “Parliamentary Assemblyintegrity”, which gathered only 137 signatures from 35 countries out of the 324 members at the Assembly,called to:“Establish … an external, fully independent and impartial inquiry into all allegations of improperconduct or corruption that may have sought to influence the work of the Assembly in recent years,focusing in particular on allegations surrounding the vote on political prisoners in Azerbaijan inJanuary 2013.”52This call for an external independent body has been supported by Transparency International53 andmany NGOs, because of “credible allegations that PACE members from various countries and politicalgroups received payments and other gifts with a view to influencing the appointment of Assemblyrapporteurs on Azerbaijan, as well as reports and resolutions of the Assembly on Azerbaijan, most notablythe PACE vote on the draft resolution on political prisoners in Azerbaijan in January 2013”.54 Thus, thesituation has become so serious that the Parliamentary Assembly had to create an independent externalinvestigation body,55whose conclusions were made public in April 2018.

Launching the infringement proceedings for the first time: so what?A. The peculiarities of the procedureOne week after the Secretary General’s call to refer to art.46(4), the Committee of Ministers:“instructed the Secretariat to prepare a draft interim resolution giving formal notice to Azerbaijan,as provided for under Article 46(4) of the Convention, of the Committee’s intention to bring beforethe Court the question whether Azerbaijan has failed to fulfil its obligation under Article 46(1) forconsideration at their 1298th (25 October 2017) meeting, should no tangible progress be made inensuring the applicant’s release.”61The threat to use this procedure had already been noted during the Human Rights Meeting in March2017.62 The interim resolution adopted on 25 October 2017 served formal notice of the intention to referthe case to the Court at its 1302nd meeting on 5 December 2017 “and invited the Republic of Azerbaijanto submit in concise form its view on this question by 29 November 2017 at the latest”.63In the resolution, the Committee insisted that Azerbaijan infringed art.18 of the ECHR in theMammodovcase, speculating how serious the violation is64 “as these actual purposes of these measures was to silenceor punish him for criticising the government”. (As the case-law on art.18 is quite limited, only one casecould be identified where the Court found a violation of both art.5, and art.5 in combination with art.18,and held that the finding of a violation was in itself sufficient just satisfaction. But the applicant had beenillegally detained “only” three days in this case.65) The Committee came to insist on the obligation of thestate to guarantee restitutio in integrum and repeat the persistent call to release the applicant. The Committeethus considers that “by not having ensured the applicant’s unconditional release, the Republic of Azerbaijanrefuses to abide by the final judgment of the Court”. It is clear from the words used that the Committee56Council of Europe, Parliamentary Assembly, AS/Bur(2017)27, para.3.57European values bought and sold, p.93.58OMCT, “Azerbaijan: Letter to the Members of the PACE, re: bribe accusations”, 16 January 2017, http://www.omct.org/human-rights-defenders/statements/azerbaijan/2017/01/d24302/ [Accessed 1 August 2018].59 The Guardian, Jennifer Rankin, “European Parliament calls for investigation into ‘Azerbaijani Laundromat’”, 14 September 2017.60 The Guardian, Jennifer Rankin, “European Parliament calls for investigation into ‘Azerbaijani Laundromat’”, 14 September 2017.61Council of Europe, CM/Del/Dec(2017)1294/H46-2, 21 September 2017, para.5.62Decision adopted on 10 March 2017, 1280th DH Meeting, H 46-2 Ilgar Mammadov group v Azerbaijan, CM/Notes/1280/H46-2.63Council of Europe, Interim Resolution CM/ResDH(2017)379, 1298th Meeting, 25 October 2017.64Article 18 of the ECHR, “The restrictions permitted under this Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purposeother than those for which they have been prescribed”. The author found only seven cases where the Court historically concluded a violation of art.18of the ECHR.65Gusinskiy v Russia (App. No.70276/01), judgment of 19 May 2004.332 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsclearly invites the European Court of Human Rights to focus its examination on inappropriate individualmeasures, and not so much on general measures.Views were submitted by Azerbaijan on 29 November 2017.66 Concerning individual measures, thegovernment recalls the final examination of the applicant’s case on 29 April 2016 by the Sheki Court ofAppeal considering that:“It particularly carefully addressed the Court’s conclusions drawn in the present judgment andremedied the deficiencies found in the proceedings leading to the applicant’s convictions.”67Yet, Azerbaijan has failed to convince the Committee of Ministers that this was the case.B. What consequences?Unsurprisingly, this decision taken by the Committee of Ministers was welcomed by civil society.68 Evenif the votes were not made public, it needs to be emphasised that the required majority of two-thirds wasachieved, which would have not been conceivable in previous years for other famous cases ofnon-compliance. This is instructive of the gravity of the situation. The first use of infringement proceedingsis always the most difficult situation an executive body has to face. It could pave the way for other cases,unless the outcome reveals it to be a complete failure. As some previous academics rightly noted, wheninternational reputation has already been damaged by non-execution “which is publicly known … it isdifficult to see what further material or motivating reputational damage a finding of the Court mightachieve”.69Nevertheless, there exists great uncertainty as to the impact of this decision. Infringement proceedingsnormallymean the suspension of control by the Committee.Written comments can be sent by the Committeeof Ministers and the government, and the Grand Chamber might decide to hold a hearing.70 The Committeewill be represented before the Court “by its Chair unless the Committee decides upon another form ofrepresentation”.71If the Court fears having to take, for a first time, a clear and strong view on the implementation of itsprevious judgment,72 it is also a wonderful opportunity for the Court to strengthen its credibility as the lastguardian of the rule of law in Europe. Whilst it is not risky to predict that the Court, whose judgmentshould not be delivered before the end of 2018, should confirm the non-compliance by Azerbaijan of thefirst IlgarMammadov case, probably both for the lack of appropriate general measures and of the applicant’srelease, it is much more difficult to guess the follow-up to such a judgment. In their joint letter to EUMember States, NGOs considered that the infringement proceedings “could eventually lead to the Councilof Europe sanctioning Azerbaijan, for example, by suspending its voting rights in the ParliamentaryAssembly”.73 Suspension may be a good alternative to expulsion for the period the country does not fully66Council of Europe, DD(2017)1346.67Council of Europe, DD(2017)1346.68Amnesty International, Public Statement, “Azerbaijan’s unlawful detention of Ilgar Mammadov leads to unprecedented infringement proceedingswith a referral to the Strasbourg Court”, 6 December 2017.69 F. de Londras and K.

Azerbaijan has also agreed to pay justsatisfaction to the victim.In the meantime, the preventive effect of this infringement procedure may yet play out. So far, theapplicant has still not been released.75 As a matter of fact, “Azerbaijani legislation provides for releaseonce two thirds of the sentence has been served, and also by presidential pardon …”.76 Two-thirds of theprison sentence was served by Ilgar Mammadov in May 2018. This seems to be confirmed by the Azerimedia.77 These various actions:“aroused concern in the government circles, which reflected the immediate release ofMehmanAliyev,the termination of the criminal case against Turan, the readiness to resolve the issue of the releaseof Ilgar Mammadov, and the signing in 2018 of an agreement on strategic partnership with theEuropean Union.”78Faced with a significant economic crisis, Azerbaijan is in need of Europeanmoney and so the EU couldplay a key role in the outcome of this process.79 Should the EU suspend the signature of the Partnershipuntil Ilgar Mammadov is released, Azerbaijan would have no other choice than to abide by the judgment.The authorities will certainly be reluctant to use the presidential pardon in this case. However, in asimilar case, Rasul Jafarov v Azerbaijan, concerning the detention of a civil activist Chairman of theHuman Rights Club, on the day of the adoption of the judgment (17March 2016), Mr Jafarov was pardonedand released by the Decree of the President of Azerbaijan.80 In his case, the Court had also found a violationof arts 5(1), 5(4), 5 and 18 and also of art.34. Azerbaijan had been ordered to pay €25,000 for non-pecuniaryand pecuniary damage. The operative part of the judgment did not refer to the applicant’s release.81 Pardonhas also been used in March 2017 for other activists.82 These events probably explain why the Committeehad decided to examine, from 2017, the Ilgar Mammadov case in combination with the Rasul Jafarovcase, a strategy which has so far not proved fruitful. Alternatively, the government may anticipate a debateon its expulsion and decide to withdraw from the Council of Europe, a threat that has been raised severaltimes in the past.IV. ConclusionThis article has shown that the infringement proceedings have been launched for the first time in a globalcontext of a serious “crisis”83 between Azerbaijan and the Council of Europe, and in a peculiar context.Thus, this event is not the consequence of a new strategy adopted by the Committee of Ministers and will74C.

Infringement proceedingshave not been used in isolation, but in combination with other attempts to restore the credibility of anorganisation seriously threatened by one of its Member States. It should also be the last step before thedecision to expel the country from the Council of Europe. Uncertainty exists on the impact the judgmentof the Court may have. Is it the right tool to address such a political crisis? Probably not. It has been writtenthat “if the Council of Europe is serious about tackling non-execution, then it must focus its attention onpolitics”.84 This author is convinced the outcome will depend on other factors and events.84 F. de Londras and K.

A core team consisting of PCI Media Impact andReading with Pictures (both NGOs) in association with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)have initiated a project called Comics Uniting Nations through which artists from across the world willcreate comic books educating about the 17 different goals. One of these goals is to promote the “physicaland mental well-being” of all. Directly within the purview of this goal fall efforts to combat HIV/AIDS.The United Nations has, once before, undertaken a project to spread awareness about HIV/AIDS throughcomic books. This article seeks to critically evaluate the hits and misses of that project from the perspectiveof public health with the aim of providing, both, a critical evaluation of the comic book project and ofhighlighting some important themes within the HIV/AIDS advocacy that Comics Uniting Nations mustaddress through the new comics.I. Introduction“Promoting and protecting human rights in the context of HIV/AIDS is essential to ensure an effectiveresponse to the epidemic. This means not only ensuring access to treatment as part of the realizationof the right to health, but equally addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination, paying particularattention to vulnerable population groups, incorporating a gender perspective, and making sure thatother related human rights aspects, such as the right to information and the right to participation, areintegral components in our response to the epidemic.”1This was the statement made by Dr. JimYongKim, Director of theWorld Health Organization (“WHO”)HIV/AIDS department in 2004 at the release of the comic book, HIV and AIDS: Stand Up for HumanRights.2 This comic book was the earliest that the United Nations released as an effort to address the myriadissues surrounding HIV and AIDS. The hope was that these comic books will address various issuesimplicit within the HIV and AIDS paradigm, apart from just stigma and discrimination, such as: State*Surabhi Shukla is a DPhil (law) student at the University of Oxford.

I arguethat the comic book experiment of the United Nations, while a novel and creative effort does little morethan address the issue of HIV and AIDS from the stigma and discrimination lens. Not only is this true ofthe earlier comics released in 2003–04 for which an argument can perhaps be made that addressing stigmaand discrimination had to be the first points of entry into the HIV/AIDS debate4, this exclusive focus wasalso seen in the last of those set of comics released by the United Nations, Score the Goals5, a 2010 release.What is needed, then, is to recognise the limitation of these comic books and to expand the venture in theform of more sophisticated releases focusing on issues like gender, sexuality, government accountabilityand socio-economic realities (among others), surrounding HIV and AIDS (Part III). This will enablereaders to get a more nuanced understanding of the disease which will ultimately help in fighting it in amore holistic manner. The release of theComics Uniting Nations comics provides an excellent opportunityto take stock of, and address, these limitations.I have picked the four comics (Part II) published by the United Nations from 2002–2010 which addressthe issue of HIV and AIDS. These four comics are: The Right to Health6,HIV/AIDS: Stand Up for HumanRights7, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone8 and Score the Goals.9 No other comics have beenpublished by the United Nations on HIV/AIDS since then and the Comics Uniting Nations project, as of16 June 2018, has not published a comic on HIV/AIDS. For this analysis, I will restrict myself to comicbooks defined in the following way: publications that consist of multiple pages and panels that tell a story,regardless of whether they are published periodically.10 Illustrations, comic strips, and information pamphletswith drawings are excluded.II. The International Law Framework for HealthBefore delving specifically into the comic books, it would perhaps be appropriate to lay down theinstrumental framework that supports this venture. Although housed in other documents,11 the InternationalCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (“ICESCR”) is credited with having the mostcomprehensive definition of the right to health in the international law regime.12 The state parties to thecovenant affirm, in art.12 their recognition, of the “right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highestattainable standard of physical and mental health.”13 Sub-part (2) of this article illustrates a list ofnon-exhaustive measures the states would take to ensure the “full realization of this right.”14 These measuresare15:3World Health Organization, “FIFA And WHO To Join Forces To Promote A Human Rights Approach to HIV/AIDS” (10 December 2004) WorldHealth Organization, http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2004/pr90/en/ [Accessed 1 August 2018].4Telephone Interview with Miriam Maluwa, Law and Human Rights Adviser, UNAIDS, (27 October 2011).5UNAIDS, Score The Goals (Geneva: United Nations, 2010).6World Health Organisation, The Right to Health, (Geneva, WHO, 2002), p.9.7WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003).8United Nation High Commission for Refugees, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (Geneva: UNHCR, 2006).9UNAIDS, Score The Goals (2010).10Robert C.

The right to health contains both freedoms and entitlements.”17 StephenMarks has succinctly summarised these freedoms and entitlements under two broad headings:A. Obligations on the health system; andB. Realization of other human rights that contribute to health.18A. Obligations on the Health System:The obligations on the health system are the conditions that the state must create to ensure access to ahealthy life to its peoples. Most of these obligations are subject to progressive realization by the states. 19However, there are certain core obligations imposed on all states via General Comment No.14. For thepurpose of this article, I will focus on howmany of the core obligations have been addressed by the comicbooks and in what manner. These obligations are: 1. non-discrimination; 2. freedom from hunger; 3. accessto basic shelter, sanitation and water; 4. essential drugs; 5. equitable distribution; and, 6. a national healthplan.20These obligations are non-derogable.21Another set of obligations accompany this list and are to be rated as “comparable”22 to this core as perthe General Comment (I treat them as core too because the words “comparable” lend themselves to thissimple conclusion). These obligations are: 1. maternal, reproductive and child health; 2. immunization;3. training of health professionals; and, 4. prevention, treatment and control of infectious diseases.23 Eachof these obligations have to be discharged in accordance with the following principles 1. availability; 2.accessibility; 3. acceptability; and 4. quality of care (hereinafter “QA3”).24(1) The principle of availability states that not only should “public health and health-carefacilities, goods and services, as well as programmes”25 be available within the state but alsothat the “underlying determinants of health, such as safe and potable drinking water andadequate sanitation facilities, hospitals, clinics and other health-related buildings, trainedmedical and professional personnel receiving domestically competitive salaries, and essentialdrugs”, (defined by the WHO Action Programme on Essential Drugs)26 should be madeavailable by the state.2716Marks, “The Emergence and Scope of the Human Right to Health,” in Zuniga et.al.

How governments are heldaccountable to these obligations are summarily mentioned later in the article (Part IV).B. Realization of Other Human Rights that Contribute to HealthAs per the CESCR, the right to health is “closely related to and dependent upon the realization of otherhuman rights”37 namely, 1. the right to food (also a core obligation); 2. the right to housing (also a coreobligation); 3. the right to work; 4. the right to education; 5. the right to human dignity; 6. the right to life;7. the right against discrimination (also a core obligation); 8. the right to equality; 9. the right againsttorture; 10. the right to privacy; 11. the right to access information; 12. the freedom of association; 13.the freedom of assembly; and, 14. the freedom of movement.

The Comic BooksA. Why Comic Books?Comics have come a long way from being considered “mindless pap”38 to being considered agents ofpeace journalism.39 Being easy to understand, they not only influence the way people think and changeoutlook, but they also employ the “universal language”40 of visual communication.Miriam Maluwa, at the time the Law and Human Rights Adviser for Joint United Nations Programmeon HIV and AIDS (“UNAIDS”), and one of the key members of the team creating the comic bookHIV/AIDS: Stand Up for Human Rights,41 recalls how the United Nation’s experiment with comic booksstarted.42 Once a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between UNAIDS and the Office of theUnited Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights (“OHCHR”) to work on HIV and human rights inconjunction, the need was to get these messages across to the populations it sought to serve and to educate.43Comic books were chosen as that medium for a myriad of reasons: they were non-conventional,44 theyengaged people positively,45 they were easily accessible,46 perhaps more exciting to read than articles,47they could be used across borders with little or no alteration48 and they appealed to peoples of all cultures,ages and countries,49 regardless of their literacy level.50 The goal to be achieved from this project was toeducate and raise awareness about HIV and AIDS, not only among young people and pre-teens but also,hopefully, among persons of all ages, across all countries.51 This last point is important to bear in mindespecially to evaluate the comics’ performance with respect to sex and sexuality.38Ellen Yamshon and Daniel Yamshon, “ComicsMedia in Conflict Resolution Programmes: Are They Effective in Promoting and Sustaining Peace”(2006) 11 Harv.

(2011) 17 Culminating Experience Action Research Projects 165,180. Courtney Sloane argues that when students are not exposed to real life information on a matter cannot relate the cartoon information to the real-lifeinformation easily. Also, scholars are of the opinion that comics and cartoons can function as a supplement for teaching but cannot function as asubstitute for it. By acting as a supplement, it can help bring out the oft neglected aspects of a particular subject by picture images. See generally,Marjorie R.

However, in practice, the comic bookswere altered keeping in mind the country in which they were being distributed. For e.g. in The Right To Health Comic at pg.9, one of the characterssays that women have the right, as men do, to decide how many children they want within the marriage. This information was modified when thecomic was distributed in China which has a one child policy.

However, Beck argues that this sort of a reasoning not only underestimates the capacity of a comicand makes paternalistic assumptions about the intellectual ability of the targeted populations, it more importantly, in her view, allows comics to transmitstereotypes in the name of simplicity.51Telephone Interview with Miriam Maluwa, Law and Human Rights Adviser, UNAIDS, (27 October 2011) and telephone interview with HelenaNygren- Krug, Health and Human Rights Adviser, WHO, (4 November 2011).340 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsB. The Comics1. The Right to Health (2002)The Right to Health is a 2002 publication of the WHO which, on the whole, addresses various facets ofhealth as a human right. The story unfolds in a classroom, located probably in Africa,52 where youngstudents have gathered from Asia, America, Europe and Africa.53 What follows is an exchange betweenthese students and a teacher of apparent African origin in which they discuss human rights. Human rightsare understood within this comic as, “What can and what cannot be done to you, and what should be donefor you.”54 The teacher informs the students that the governments are responsible for ensuring that humanrights are enjoyed by its residents.55 The teacher notes that the governments have undertaken to ensurethese rights for its residents through various treaties and covenants such as those on children’s rights, therights of a woman, and against discrimination.56The conversation turns to discrimination. Upon being asked what discrimination is, one of the studentsreplies that it is being treated in a “bad way.”57 The teacher agrees that everyone has a right to be treatedwith equal respect.58 Then one of the students of apparent Chinese origin narrates an incident ofdiscrimination that he witnessed in his village. He narrates that the health worker in his village revealedthat one of his neighbours was infected with the HIV/AIDS virus.59 When this news became public, theneighbour lost his job and his family was evicted from the village.60 Different members of the class havedifferent reactions to this story. The teacher points out that the health worker should have protected theprivacy of the patient who should not have been discriminated against because he was living with HIV.61Another student joins in saying that no one should be discriminated against on the basis of religion, skincolour etc.62 The class then discusses other aspects of possible unequal treatment like sex discrimination.This discussion, premised on the right to privacy and against discrimination, concludes that, “men andwomen have the same rights all their lives.”63 This includes, the right to education, the right to decide ifand whom they will marry, the right to decide if, and how many children they want, and when.64At this juncture, the students interject and inform the class that health “depends on lots of other things… especially living conditions.”65A student elaborates by way of example, “the water is dirty in my villageand so we are often ill.”66 The teacher agrees stating that “the right to health also means healthy livingconditions.”67Another student questions what the right to health might mean if a person is ill.68 The teacherreplies that when one is ill, the right to health must include easy access to healthcare69, caring and respectfultreatment,70 the right to information about the illness and the right to be heard by the medical practitioner.7152Although, in this comic, like all the others being studied in this Article, the geographical location is undisclosed: probably to give the comic booka more universal appeal.53WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.4.54WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.4.55WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.5.56WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.5.57WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.6.58WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.6.59WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.7.60WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.7.61WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.7.62WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.7.63WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.8.64WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.8–9.65WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.p. 10.66WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.10.67WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.10.68WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.11.69WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.11.70WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.12.71WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.12.United Nations and HIV/AIDS: The Comic Book Experiment 341[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThus, the teacher conveys to the students that the right to health is more than a right to medicine. Theright to health is closely and practically associated with the many social entitlements listed above. Thegovernments are responsible, the teacher states, for making healthcare affordable for all, and human rightsshould form the first priority when a government is deciding how to spend money.72 The teacher also statesthat rich governments have an obligation to help poor governments meet their human rights needs.73Understanding the right to health as a right contingent upon socio-economic conditions and a right toaccess health services, the comic book squarely places the responsibility on the government of variousnations to make sure that the right to health of its citizens is maintained. The class takes a break.2. HIV and AIDS: Stand Up for Human Rights (2003)HIV and AIDS: Stand Up for Human Rights is a 2003 publication (updated in 2010) of theWHO, OHCHRand UNAIDS. The story unfolds on the football field,74 once again, in an undisclosed geographical location,where a group of kids from various nationalities including European, Chinese, Indian, African etc. havegathered for a game of football. One of the friends, Freddy, however, is unable to join the game as he hasto be home nursing his sick mother who is suffering fromHIV/AIDS. After an initial wave of apprehensionamong the kids, many of whom want to ostracise Freddy and his mother owing to the “terrible”75 disease,the focus of the story shifts to educating the kids about HIV/AIDS: how it spreads and how it does not,certain prevention techniques and more specifically, the right of those suffering from HIV/AIDS to betreated in a manner free from discrimination. The protagonist of the story, a young man of apparentEuropean origin, elaborates that one can be infected with the HIV virus through 1. unprotected sex; 2.infected blood; and 3. needle sharing.76 He informs us not to take drugs or share needles, to wait to havesex, to not feel compelled to have sex under any kind of peer pressure and to use a condom when we do.77The other players in the field are hearing such information for the first time—they are denied theirright to education about HIV in their schools.78 They are not taught that HIV does not spread by shakinghands, by hugging or kissing and the footballers now realise that they should not exclude Freddy fromthe game.79 In fact, they race home to Freddy’s to help him and his mother. When they reach Freddy’shouse, his mother tells them that when she visited the health centre, no one paid any attention to her andshe had to wait for a long time before she was attended to.80 When Freddy’s mother finally went up to thedoctor he turned her away saying he could do nothing for her.81 The protagonist of the story points outthat Freddy’s mother was being discriminated against. To this she replies that all over the world, peopleliving with HIV/AIDS were being subject to this discriminatory behaviour: some lose their jobs,82 if theyeven get one, and some cannot attend school.83The newly enlightened children decide that they must change this. One of the players is Alisha, a younggirl. When she returns home that evening, she tells her parents everything she learnt about HIV/AIDS thatday and that Freddy’s mother was refused help.84 Alisha’s father is in charge at the health centre at whichFreddy’s mother was refused help. The next day, he confronts the doctor at the health centre. He tells him72WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.13.73WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.13.74 In her experience on the field Miriam noticed that football was the one unifying factor among refugees from various countries who played footballusing coconut shells. This inspired the story to unfold on a football field.75WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.3.76WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.4.77WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.4.78WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.5.79WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.5.80WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.7.81WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.7.82WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.8.83WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.8.84WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.9.342 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthat irrespective of a person’s HIV/AIDS status, they should have “equal access to healthcare andtreatment.”85 The doctor understands, and Freddy’s mother goes back to the hospital. 86The footballers want to do more to spread the word against discrimination of persons living withHIV/AIDS. They make posters informing others not to discriminate and that “people living with HIV arelike you and me.”87 A passer-by who happens to gaze upon these posters informs the youngsters that thereis much more that can be done to combat “HIV and discrimination.”88 Sex discrimination, classdiscrimination, race discrimination, discrimination against people who are sick and the right to refuseunsafe sex are all matters about which the young footballers and the gathered crowd educate each other.89It is unclear whether the passers-by and the crowd relate these other kinds of discrimination back toHIV/AIDS in any way: vulnerability to the virus, for example. Once again, the comic places theresponsibility on governments to protect human rights. The concluding twist reveals that the youngprotagonist of the story who had educated all his friends on the football field is himself living withHIV/AIDS.90 The last page of the comic reiterates how HIV/AIDS is spread and that everyone living withthe virus has a right, to respect, to information and against discrimination.913. HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006)HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone is a 2006 publication of the United Nations High Commissionerfor Refugees (UNHCR) which focuses on the lives of the Karagli family (a family of apparent Africanorigin) as they flee their village which is under attack from rebel forces.92 As they enter a checkpoint inthe neighbouring country, an official asks Papa Kargali why they had to flee. While he is narrating theincidents of carnage that took place in his country, an armed official at the checkpoint stops him and says,“Stop. You look like you have AIDS.”93 Just then, a UNHCRworker interjects and asserts the 1951 GenevaRefugee Convention according to which refugees cannot be returned to a country where they facepersecution. Their HIV positive status cannot be a reason to deny them refugee status.94The next panel shows the Kargali family living in the refugee camp of the neighbouring country. PapaKargali’s illness has now advanced and he is too tired to go to the market to get food for his children.95Additionally, his son is excluded from football because of the father’s illness.96His daughter is propositionedfor sex by an older man in return for soap and money.97Village elders and advocates point out how this behaviour is wrong. The next day at the market, thevillagers refuse to buy products from Papa Kargali’s shop saying he has AIDS and accuse all refugees oftaking up their land and spreading AIDS in their country.98 Once again, advocates point out how refugeesface stigma and discrimination just for being refugees. Additionally, the advocate states, refugees are alsooften falsely accused of spreading AIDS.Up to this point in the story, it is unclear whether Papa Kargali actually has HIV/AIDS. It is on theirdaughter’s insistence that Papa Kargali and his wife, Desire, decide to get tested.99 The health practitioner85WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.10.86WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.10.87WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.11.88WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.12.89WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.12–13.90WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.14.91WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.16.92UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.4.93UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.4.94UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.5.95UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.6.96UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.6.97UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.8.98UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.8.99UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.10.United Nations and HIV/AIDS: The Comic Book Experiment 343[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsinforms them that their results will be kept confidential and not revealed without permission.100 She alsoinforms them that in case they test positive for HIV, the health centre can provide them with nutritionalsupport, medication and counselling groups.101Five years later, the story ends with peace returning to the village of the Karagli family, and althoughPapa Karagli has lost the battle against AIDS, his family, having received their new education in HIV/AIDS,spread the word and bring awareness about the disease as they return to their village1024. Score the Goals (2010)The final endeavour in this direction is the comic book called Score the Goalswhich is a 2010 publicationof the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (“FAO”), the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership(Stop TB Partnership), UNAIDS, the United Nations Development Programme (“UNDP”), the UnitedNations Department of Public Information (“DPI”) and the United Nation Office on Sport for Developmentand Peace (UNOSDP). The story begins when an all-star football ship goes missing at sea. The playersfind themselves on a desert island and realise that food, water and shelter would be absolutely necessaryif they are to survive until help arrives.103Through their survival efforts, the team highlights several millennium development goals like eradicationof hunger and poverty; achievement of primary education and gender equality; reduction of child mortalityrate; improvement of maternal health; endeavours for environmental sustainability and combatingHIV/AIDS (limited to the extent of fighting stigma and discrimination against those affected). The storyends when all the members of the crew learn about these important lessons in how to do one’s bit inachieving them and a rescue team comes and saves the day.IV. Critical Analysis of the Comic BooksA. Obligations of the Health SystemThe core obligations on each government system signatory to the ICESCR are highlighted above (Part IIA). These obligations are core obligations for the purpose of a right to health, understood generally. Inaddition, if these obligations have to qualify as the core, in any meaningful way, they have to also forma part of the core of each health issue. The issue in question for the present inquiry is HIV/AIDS andtherefore, I will assess howmany of these core obligations were mentioned while the UN comics discussedthe topic of HIV/AIDS and whether they were discharged in keeping with the QA3 principles. When thecore obligation is discussed, I will critically analyse which parts of its contents have been addressed andwhich were missed so that the future comics may take those misses into account as well. In fleshing outthe content of these core obligations, I will rely chiefly on their understanding in General Comment 14and other international law documents.1. Core Obligation of Discrimination(1) Incomplete Discussion of Discrimination The comics tell us that discrimination is “being treateddifferently… but in a bad way.”104 The comics educate about HIV/AIDS105 and tell us that resources should100UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.9.101UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.10.102UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.11–14.103UNAIDS, Score The Goals (2010), p.3.104WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.6. See also, WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.2. This is an illustrative list.105WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.4–5, 16.344 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsbe available and accessible106 to all regardless of their HIV/AIDS status and no one should be discriminatedagainst: fired/not hired107; excluded from school108, sports,109 peer group,110 village or community life owingto this.111 One will practically read the comics’ general precept about the availability of health services,112,water, food, housing and healthy living conditions113 to be applicable to persons living with HIV/AIDSwithout discrimination. Still, the availability of health programmes and services for HIV/AIDS (or moregenerally, health) without discrimination is not mentioned as a core government obligation.114 Instead, inone comic, a private health practitioner/manager of a health centre115 finds out about an act of discriminationagainst an HIV/AIDS patient and corrects it.116 Only the 2003 comic mentions that “governments haveresponsibilities to promote and protect human rights.”117 However, this responsibility has not been peggedto health or the core obligation to not discriminate with respect to HIV/AIDS status.While the comic asks governments to prioritise health in their budgets and exhorts rich countries tohelp poor countries118, it does not tell us that non- discrimination with respect to HIV/AIDS status (or moregenerally, health) is an achievable goal even for resource stripped countries.119 It can be achieved withminimum resources by adoption/repeal of legislation and dissemination of information.120 In 2010, theSecretary General analysed responses from various government bodies, UN bodies, and non-governmentalorganizations from across the world to assess the responses to the disease. The analysis suggested someways in which immediate action can be taken without severe monetary implications. Some of thesesuggestions which were least resource heavy included the repeal of repressive sex-related laws whichdrive certain sexual behaviour underground and increase vulnerability to the virus, and the ability to seektreatment.121Finally, in keeping with the principle of accessibility, at least one of the comics tells us that healthservices must be “easy to reach”122, affordable123 and that we should be heard “because it is what is bestfor you [us] that counts.”124(2) Intersections of Discrimination Not Discussed The intersections of HIV/AIDS status (or health,generally) with prohibited grounds of discrimination125 such as, “the grounds of race126, colour, sex127,106WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.16.107WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.8.108WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.8.109UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.4.110UNAIDS, Score The Goals (2010), p.14.111WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.7.112WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.7 which does mention this specifically with respect to HIV positive persons.113WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.10.114 See the statement of Mr. Dainius Puras, the Special Rapporteur on Health, made to the General Assembly on 25 October 2016 where he hasstressed this point. https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20806&LangID=E [Accessed 1 August 2018].115Alisha’s father’s profession is unclear from the comic.

A substantive equality lens willrequire showing how the problem of discrimination is compounded by skin colour.127 For example, WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.8 and WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.12. What is needed is a littlemore than saying that boys and girls are equal. A substantive equality lens will require showing how the problem of discrimination is compounded bygender and sexual orientation.United Nations and HIV/AIDS: The Comic Book Experiment 345[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorslanguage, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin128, property129, birth, physical ormental disability, health status (including HIV/AIDS), sexual orientation and civil, political, social orother status” are not discussed. These grounds may contribute in determining a person’s susceptibilityand bargaining power when it comes to this disease.130HIV/AIDS: Stand Up for Human Rights shows thatFreddy’s mother is infected with the virus but does not show how her socio-economic condition may havemade her more susceptible to the virus. Jonathan Mann had identified very early on in the epidemic thatsocio-cultural factors will play a big role in tackling the issue. He had identified tabooed sexual activitiesas one of the obstacles that the society will have to deal with if it wants to comprehensively deal with thedisease.131The comics missed out on an important segment of “vulnerable communities” such as, the gaycommunity, men who have sex with men (“MSM”)132, and the youth in the age range of 15–24133 who arevastly regarded as the most sensitive group. While Miriam says that the reason for doing this was thatthey did not want to send a very complicatedmessage through a pilot comic, Helen agrees that if the comicwas written today, it would certainly be more nuanced and would incorporate the gay community.134The Secretary General’s Report of 2010 on HIV/AIDS has noted after studying government responsesthat MSM, sex workers, drug users, prisoners etc. have an increased vulnerability to the virus but theirneeds are still ignored in the response to the HIV/AIDS.135 He consequently recommended a betterassessment of the needs of these populations. It is worth noting that at the time of writing these comics,General Comment No.14 had committed to providing health care to people without discrimination on thebasis of sexual orientation136 but the United Nations had not made concrete commitments to many vulnerablegroups. For example the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS did not specify key categorieslike MSM or persons who use drugs; instead adopted the vague broad concept of “vulnerable groups”.137However, the newer comics should certainly address these populations in light of several studies and theSecretary General’s report.128The 2006 comic talks about a refugee’s right to be treatment without discrimination irrespective of HIV status and also tries to tackle the mythassociated with refugees- that they are carriers of HIV/AIDS. See UNHCR, HIV and UNAIDS, Score The Goals (2010), WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand upfor human rights (2003), CESCR, General Comment No.14.129 For example, WHO, HIV/AIDS: Stand up for human rights (2003), p.13.What is needed is a little more than saying that rich and poor are equal.A substantive equality lens will require showing how the problem of discrimination is compounded by social class/caste.130The only place in the comics where an intersectionality is shown is when Fatou Kargali considers exchanging sex for money and soap although“it doesn’t feel right.” See UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.6. Perhaps this panel has been made to talk about the rightto basic shelter, sanitation and water but the panel misses the opportunity to spell this out or to place the responsibility of this on governments (coreobligation). Instead, when Fatou narrates this story to an older woman, she hears the following: “My dear Fatou, you did well to run away as this isnot a solution for you or your family. You must finish your school, there are many other ways to earn a little money to help your family and yourfriends must learn to say no to a man like that.” See UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.7.131 See, Stemple, “Health and Human Rights in Today’s Fight Against HIV/AIDS” 2008, 22 (Suppl 2) AIDS S113, S118.132 In many Sub- Saharan African countries, the MSM form at least 20% of the cases of newly infected people. UNAIDS, Global Report: UNAIDSReport on the Global AIDS Epidemic 2010 30 (2010). Other Studies suggest that there could bemyriad reasons for the lack of work with gay communities:1. Homophobic stigma, 2. Restrictive foreign aid policies that are not always supportive of gay rights or 3. Lack of skill of scope of many NGOs toarticulate gay rights issues when they are intertwined with HIV.

Helena made this particular point with respect to homosexuality, perhaps this statement could also today beextended to other categories of vulnerable groups.135 The Protection of Human Rights in the Context of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)20 December 2010, p.14.136 See also, CESCR, General Comment No.14.137 See Stemple, “Health and Human Rights in Today’s Fight Against HIV/AIDS” 2008, 22 (Suppl 2) AIDS S113, S116. However, in June 2011,the Human Rights Council adopted the first ever United Nations resolution on the rights of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people whichwill result in the first ever United Nations study on the situation of the LGBT people around the world with a view to rectify the challenges they face.See generally, Press Statement by Hillary Rodham Clinton, United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution on Sexual Orientation and GenderIdentity, (Washington DC, 17 June 2011).346 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe HIV/AIDS: Stand Up for Human Rights (2003) promotes an abstinence model138 when it says “weshould wait to have sex”139 and in the same page, the comic informs us, by showing us a heterosexualcouple in bed, that when we do have sex, we must condom-ise.140 It also shows that the man in the coupleis very receptive to the idea of a condom. This depiction of sex, not only misses out on the entire gaycommunity (which in many sub-Saharan African countries account for twenty percent of the newinfections141) in its portrayal of the “assumed naturalness”142 of heterosexuality, but also fails to addressthe point that women are usually not in a position to negotiate the use of the condom.143 It would havebeen more helpful or at least educational, if the comic had informed of female condoms which wouldhave helped the woman protect herself from sexually transmitted disease and would have proved to be ofgreat help for women in a weaker negotiable position. Additionally, female condoms are said to create a“pleasurable friction”144 ; a fact that could have definitely gone a long way to encourage condom use.This heterosexist bent is repeated when, in the comic Right to Health,145 marriage is presented as aheterosexual privilege and children are presented as benefits within the marriage paradigm.146 To be sure,there are positive message as regards sexuality too: Page 12 of HIV/AIDS comic147 shows that womenhave the right to say no to unsafe sex and page 16 of the same comic asserts the right against discriminationirrespective of “sexual choices”148, thus keeps the discussion open for incorporating vulnerable communitieslike MSM communities.Finally, with respect to the principles of acceptability and quality of care, at least one of the comics dotell us that doctors must accept privacy and safeguard against unwarranted disclosure regardless of HIVstatus (however, this obligation has been mentioned only with respect of the doctor and not in rem)149 butit does not tell us that a key attribute of this acceptance is that the HIV person’s treatment must be respectfuland commensurate with their culture. However, the comic does not mention that persons living with HIVand AIDS have a discrimination free quality of care claim in the form of trained medical professionalsand unexpired medicines.2. The Core Obligation of Essential DrugsThe comics must make clear that essential drugs are a human right and it is a core obligation150 forgovernments to provide essential drugs to its peoples commensurate with the QA3 principles.151 The placeto find a list of essential medicines for the purpose of obligations under the ICESCR is theWHO Essential138Maybe this is because a large part of the HIV/AIDS budget is dependent on donations and United States, which itself supports and promotes orat least did, at the time of writing this comic, promote this approach abroad.

The comicsmust also mention that this means that the governments must ensure that the production, distribution andpricing of medicines favour the continuous availability and accessibility of essential medicines in eachcountry at affordable prices and within an hour’s walk from home.154 The comics must make very clearthat the claims of intellectual property in essential medicines are weaker than the human right of essentialmedicines155 and that the state can intervene through trade practices such as parallel importing andcompulsory licensing to privilege the core obligation.156 Finally, the comics must also demonstrate howon the ground access to essential medicines depends on one’s social reality.3. The Core Obligation of Prevention, Treatment and Control of Infectious DiseasesThis obligation requires instituting educational programmes on HIV/AIDS and other determinants of goodhealth, such as economic development, gender equity, a safe environment and education. Score the Goalsdeals with this core obligation to some extent when it addresses malaria prevention by using mosquitorepellents and mosquito nets, the benefits of moving water over stagnant water, and tuberculosis.157Scorethe Goals also busts some myths about the spread of HIV.158 It tells us that HIV/AIDS does not spread bytouching, working alongside an affected person, sharing a meal etc.159 Once again, this brief mention ofprevention and cure of these diseases is done by the star football team but the QA3 principles are not builtin.4. Core Obligations Partially MentionedWhile generally speaking about the right to health, the comics tell us that health depends on living condition,clean drinking water160, food and housing,161but the comics do not tell us that clean drinking water, foodand housing are non-derogable core obligations of signatories either with respect to the right to healthgenerally or with respect to the HIV issue specifically. Consequentially, there is no discussion about theprinciples of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of care through which these obligationsmay be borne out.152WHOModel List of Essential Medicines, 20th list (March 2017) at http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/20th_EML2017.pdf?ua=1 [Accessed 1 August 2018]153Committee for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No.17, pp.19–21.154WHO Essential Medicines List and the MGD Gap Task Force Millennium Development Goal 8: Delivering on the Global Partnership forAchieving the Millennium Development Goals MGD Gap Task Force Report 2008.155Committee for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No.17, 2006.156Montreal Statement on Essential Medicines at Thomas Pogge, “Montreal Statement on the Human Right to Essential Medicines” (2007) 16(1)Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics, 104.157UNAIDS, Score The Goals (2010), p.9, 17.158 See also, UNHCR, HIV and AIDS: Human Rights for Everyone (2006), p.5.159UNAIDS, Score The Goals (2010), p.14–15.160UNAIDS, Score The Goals (2010), p.8, 9.161WHO, The Right to Health, (2002), p.10.

Core Obligations that are Not Mentioned At AllSome core obligations such as, equitable distribution, training of health professionals, immunization,maternal and reproductive health162 and the requirement of a national health plan are completely omittedwith respect to the issue of HIV (and health in general).6. No Information about What a Person May Do in the Scenario of Non-ComplianceNone of the comics elaborate what a person can do when the state does not meet its health-relatedobligations. While one does find a mention of the responsibility of the government to protect and promotehuman rights in some of the comics,163 it is unclear what those words mean and how, if at all, one canensure that one’s government discharges its obligation.(1) Office of the HighCommissioner for HumanRights It is beyond the scope of this article to elaborateon enforcement mechanisms within the UN. However, significantly, as Marks asserts, the concept ofsovereignty is “less than ever an insurmountable obstacle”164 andmanymonitoring systems have now beenput in place to fulfil several UN Charter objectives. Summarily, the Office of the High Commissioner forHuman Rights (OHCHR) provides oversight to the monitoring of treaty obligations. The commissioneris the “principal human rights official of the United Nations”165 and this office works to monitor, providepublic reports and to provide technical assistance to countries in the fulfilment of their human rightsobligations.166 It carries out these tasks with the help of the bodies described below, all of which workunder the general supervision of the OHCHR.i. The Public Procedure or the 1235 procedure167 (which owing to newer mechanisms has beenrendered unnecessary) was used to scrutinise all manner of violations by the appointmentof a Special Rapporteur.168ii. The 1503 Procedure169: this procedure involves a closed door examination of a “consistentpattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights.”170 This procedure has nowbeen replaced by aiii. confidential complaints procedure to address, “consistent patterns of gross and reliablyattested violations of all human rights and all fundamental freedoms occurring in any partof the world and under any circumstance.”171162The comic does mention the right of women to choose if and when they want to marry and how many children they want to have. But, it doesnot discuss the societal pressures that bear upon this choice and consequences for maternal, reproductive and child rights and health. See WHO, TheRight to Health, (2002), p.9. In Score the Goals, at p.13, the lost at sea all-star football team does mention that the health of the pregnant fan was their“top priority” but the comic misses an opportunity to state what else constitutes maternal health.

These expertsmonitor situations of human rights abuse according to their mandate. Marks states that as of 2014 therehave been 37 thematic rapporteurs on issues such as housing, child prostitution, involuntary disappearances,food, poverty, racism, independence of judges etc.172(3) Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council Since 2007, the Human Rights Councilhas been empowered to scrutinise the human rights records of all its member states. The council looks atthe reports of governments, of rapporteurs, of other UN bodies, non- governmental organizations, academicand research institutes and regional organizations to draw a list of recommendations for each country.173Governments are then held accountable to these recommendations to which theymay respond by addressingthe issues at hand or by justifying and explaining their position.174(4) Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights This committee is the monitoring body forall countries that have ratified the ICESCR. This is a “body of 18 independent experts that monitorsimplementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights by its Statesparties.”175 The committee hears individual complaints (by those countries signed on to the optionalprotocol), state on state complaints (this has never been used)176 and conducts confidential inquiries onhuman rights abuses on those countries that have recognised the competence of the committee to do so.177It also considers shadow reports submitted by non- governmental organizations in addition to State reportsand issues a set of recommendations for the state.V. ConclusionIt would have been worthwhile to see how the comic book experiment fared, despite it lacking focus onthe issue of HIV/AIDS from a holistic, socio-political and sexuality angle. However, there has been noformal evaluation of the work, although,Miriam asserts that these comic books have been very successful,chiefly from the number of reprint requests that they received from various schools and Governments.178If there is be any real progress in fighting the disease through the medium of comic books, one needs tobe aware of the exact impact each part of the comic has had, which part needs to be modified, which partneeds to be explained in more detail etc: in sum, a robust “evidentiary standard common to social science”179needs to be set up to make a fair assessment of strengths and weakness and to recognise areas that needwork.This article makes a beginning at that by analysing the comics through a public health perspective.This critique can serve as a ready reference for the next edition of comic books on HIV/AIDS. However,the important point this article attempts to bring home is that the comic book project cannot ignore thegeneral jurisprudence emerging fromUN documents, statements, General Comments and other associated172 For more information, see Marks, “The United Nations and Human Rights”, in Weston and Grear (eds.)

If it does so, it will inevitably miss out on importantareas which require advocacy.One way to incorporate these suggestions could be that each comic could bring together artists, affectedpersons (especially the vulnerable sections whose voice is not captured effectively), international lawscholars, and in-field human rights defenders to lay out all the issues that need to be discussed with respectto the disease. Then, perhaps, it could be decided that there will be more than one comic on the issue andeach comic would pick out one core right to health obligation with respect to HIV/AIDS that it will address,alongside its intersectionalities.It is also not true that, artistically, it is difficult to show intersectionalities of rights. In a new releasecalled Night Stars by Comics Uniting Nations, one panel mentions that rural women lack ownership andfinancing to till their lands.180 This not only shows that ownership of lands varies by gender, but also thatit varies by rural/urban setting. If research has found that access to treatment depends on economic status,then a comic can demonstrate this by drawing two adjacent panels, one in which a HIV/AIDS affectedperson who is visibly affluent is given treatment, and the other in which a visibly poor person is deniedtreatment. Similarly, these panels can be adapted to demonstrate difference in access based on other factorsthat studies may reveal: race, sex, caste, religion, homelessness, gender identity, sexual orientation,imprisonment status so on and so forth.Most importantly, presently, the comics are not incomprehensible to anyone who cannot read and write.There are big dialogue boxes with a lot of content but the pictures do not tell a story by themselves.Perhaps, the illustrations, if drawn in a more telling way, would be more effective in conveying the messageto the intended population.180Timothy P.

Excludedaccounts are those used for the purposes of trade, business or a profession.5Section 40A(2) of the IA 2014details that immigration checks means checking (based on information held by a specified anti-fraudorganisation or data-matching authority) whether an account is operated by a disqualified person. Section40A(3) of the IA 2014 defines a disqualified person as a person in the UKwho does not have, but requires,leave to remain and that the Secretary of State considers an account should not be provided for.The IA 2014 (Current Accounts) (Compliance &c) Regulations 2016 (the Regulation) is the Regulationresponsible for immigration checks. Regulation 2 notes that immigration checks must be carried out duringeach successive quarter of each year. This means that banks and building societiesmust conduct immigrationchecks four times a year, every year. The explanatory memorandum of the Regulation does not make astatement of compatibility with the ECHR, as it is not required.6 This necessitates a consideration underthe ECHR.The European Convention on Human RightsThe immigration checks set out in the IA 2014 and the Regulation will be assessed on its compatibilitywith the ECHR. This assessment considers whether immigration checks are compatible with art.8 in andof itself, and whether it is compatible with art.8 in conjunction with art.14.Compatibility of immigration checks with art.8 of the European Convention on HumanRightsa. Immigration checks interfere with art.8Article 8 details that:(1) Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and hiscorrespondence.(2) There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right exceptsuch as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interestsof national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for theprevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protectionof the rights and freedoms of others.For art.8 to apply, it has to be interfered with. The threshold for interfering with art.8 is not a particularlya high one,7 and the evidence for interferences does not necessarily have to be factual.8Due to the protectionof personal data being of fundamental importance to a person’s enjoyment of their private and family life,9its mere storage interferes with art.8.10 Subsequent use is irrelevant to that finding.11 The European Courtof Human Right’s Grand Chamber has due regard to the way in which records are used and processedand the results that may be obtained.12 More specific to s.40A(1) of the IA 2014 and the Regulation is thatinformation that is retrieved from banking documents undoubtedly amounts to personal data, irrespective5Regulation 2 of the IA 2014 (Current Accounts) (Excluded Accounts and Notification Requirements) Regulations 2017 (SI 2016/1252).6Explanatory Memorandum to the IA 2014 (Current Accounts) (Compliance &c) Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/1073), at [6.1].7AG (Eritrea) v Secretary of State [2007] EWCA Civ 801; [2008] Imm.

Along with the suspension on freezing accounts, current account checks have beentemporarily reduced.15 This, however, does not affect the validly of the arguments that will be made fora variety of reasons. Firstly, s.40A(1) and the Regulation has not been repealed, suspended or revoked,and is thus still the law as it stands, secondly, there is no detail as to how and in what ways current accountchecks will be reduced (for e.g. will it still be quarterly?), thirdly, due to the reductions being temporary,they are not permanent and there is no clarity as to how long these reductions will last. Fourthly, even ifthere are temporary reductions, these could be completely bypassed by immigration exemptions in Sch.2,para.4 of the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018).16 Finally, given that s.40A(1) and the Regulation isstill in force, it is important to remember that “[i]t is the potential reach of the power rather than its actualuse by which its legality must be judged”.17 Every current account that is not an excluded account ispotentially subject to this power and insufficient legal restraints does not become legal simply becauseself-restrainmay be exercised.18References to the temporary reductions will be highlightedwhere necessary.Once interference has been established, it is necessary to consider whether current account checks arecompatible with art.8 by determining whether it is in “accordance with the law”, pursue a legitimate aim,and is “necessary in a democratic society”.b. Immigration checks need to be in accordance with the lawThe interference of a measure must be “in accordance with the law”, requiring some basis in domesticlaw.19 The issue that arises with reducing current account checks is that its basis would still be based upons.40A(1) and the Regulation and if not, this would violate art.8 for not having a legal basis.20 This highlightsanother reason why both s.40A(1) and the Regulation would still have to be considered under the ECHR.The domestic law has to satisfy what is referred to as the “quality of the law” meaning it has to becompatible with the rule of law,21 accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to its effects.22Publication of the law (as is the case on legislation.gov.uk) makes it likely that s.40A(1) of the IA 2014and the Regulation comply with accessibility.23 However, given that current account checks have beentemporarily reduced, the details of those reductions have not been made available to the public.24 This,therefore, does not “set out in a form accessible to the public any indication”25 as to how and in what wayscurrent account checks will be reduced, thus not making the policy open to public knowledge or scrutiny.26A law that is not accessible is not “in accordance with the law” for the purposes of art.8 and violates it.2713M.N. and Others v San Marino (2016) 62 E.H.R.R. 19 at [51].14The Guardian, “Sajid Javid says government’s hostile environment will be reviewed – video” (3 June 2018), The Guardian, https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2018/jun/03/sajid-javid-says-governments-hostile-environment-will-be-reviewed-video [Accessed 1 August 2018]; B.

It couldbe argued that s.40A(1) and the Regulation satisfies this requirement because the law is clear as to whencurrent accounts will be checked (quarterly). Due to the checks occurring quarterly, it could also be arguedthat such measures are not arbitrary in that they can only occur during a said quarter.However, these arguments are unconvincing for reasons that will now be highlighted. Section 40A(1)and the Regulation provides no scope of any such discretion because 70 million accounts will be checkedon a continuous basis. The quarterly indication is not adequate in that it guarantees art.8 interference isinevitable. If the temporary reduction in current account checks are taken into account, would they stilloccur on a quarterly basis? If not, what is the frequency of said checks? This makes the position unclear.There is no indication as to, or under, what circumstances (e.g. when there are reasons to suspect33 that acurrent account belongs to a disqualified person) an immigration check may ensue, thus making themeasure arbitrary because the vast majority of accounts will be screened for the sole purpose that theyexist. It also does not take into account that individuals may have leave to remain, outstanding applicationsand appeals pending.34 A temporary reduction in current account checks does not alter the fact that thecriteria for them occurring is still unclear. There is also the fact that in 9.5% of cases, “disqualified persons”were not in the UK (by the IA 2014’s own definition, they would not be a disqualified person as they arenot present in the UK) but were still screened.35 This will be exacerbated by s.40A(1) and the Regulationand temporary reduction of its use would not rectify this. Moreover, current accounts will be continuouslychecked even if an individual’s current account has been ruled out as not belonging to a disqualified personon first inspection, treating every current account with de facto suspicion.36 Moreover, this is all the morestriking when 70 million current accounts will be routinely checked for the aim of catching 6000over-stayers, and 900 every proceeding year,37 which highlights the arbitrary and virtually unfettered38nature of the powers. It does not give individuals adequate indications as to when the law will apply to28Amann v Switzerland (27798/95) (2000) 30 E.H.R.R. 843 at [56].29Uzun v Germany (35623/05) (2011) 53 E.H.R.R. 24 at [61].30 Privacy International, “Memorandum of Laws Concerning the Legality of Data Retention with regard to the Rights Guaranteed by the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights” (10 October 2003), www.statewatch.org/news/2003/oct/Data_Retention_Memo.pdf [Accessed 1 August 2018], p3.31 Szabo and Vissy v Hungary (37138/14) (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 3 at [230]–[231].32 S and Marper v UK (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 50 at [103].33Roman Zakharov v Russia (47143/06) (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 17 at [260].34D.

Additionally, there are no clear or binding40 detailed rules on what information will be screenedduring an immigration check, thus it cannot be ruled out that sensitive personal data will also be checked.It has been argued that for the purposes of art.8, immigration checks as envisaged in s.40A(1) and theRegulation, even with the temporary reductions are very unlikely to pass the test of foreseeability andwould therefore not “in accordance with the law” and thus amount to a violation.41 Finding a measure notto be in “accordance with the law” usually obviates the need to consider whether the measure is “necessaryin a democratic society”,42 but it is possible for the European Court of Human Rights to consider thisregardless.43c. Do immigration checks pursue a legitimate aim?A legitimate aim is an exemption44 found with art.8(2), such as national security and public safety. Theseexemptions are exhaustive and restrictive, and to attain compatibility with art.8, the interference mustpursue an aim “that can be linked to one of those listed in that provision”.45 Such link must be reasonableand genuine to be considered legitimate.46The Home Office have argued on a general point that the European Court of Human Rights regardsthe deportation of foreign criminals and immigration controls as legitimate aims under art.8(2).47 TheHome Office continued that the UK’s Supreme Court48 and Court of Appeal49 agree that immigrationcontrol falls within protecting the economic well-being of a country. One could even refer to the EuropeanCourt of Human Right’s position in Saadi v UK where the Grand Chamber noted that subject to theirobligations under the Convention, States enjoy an “undeniable sovereign right to control aliens” entryinto and residence in their territory.50This position, however, can be critiqued. The Home Office refers to the European Court of HumanRights on the issue of deportation being a legitimate aim, when s.40A(1) and the Regulation do not actuallydeal with deportation. This can be evidenced by the fact that the Home Office does not acknowledge thatart.8 is even engaged,51 for current account checks. Thus, no legitimate aim to justify interference has beenadvocated. Furthermore, the reference to Saadi concerned the control of migrants’ entry and residence,whereas s.40A(1) and the Regulation concerns the rights of migrants and citizens.In playing devil’s advocate, it must be noted that JudgeWildhaber’s et al concurring opinion in Rotarunoted that the more or less indiscriminate processing of personal data (in that instance, storage) in pursuitof a legitimate aim is “evidently problematic”.52 This highlights that the more or less indiscriminate39M.

On the matter of current account checks the HomeOffice relies upon the general (or public) interest ground under art.1 Protocol 1.53 However, a public orgeneral interest is not a legitimate aim that can justify interference under art.8(2). Korff gives the exampleof art.9 (freedom of religion, thought and conscious) not having national security as a permissiblejustification for interference noting that “[s]tates may therefore not interfere with that right on that ground”.54Even if one were to consider a simplistic definition of economic well-being, that being, preventingmonetaryloss through the activities of disqualified persons, the impact assessment of current account checksacknowledges that this will lead to a net loss of £0.8 million over ten years,55 whereas the “Do Nothing”results in no net loss, but somehow does not meet the Government’s objective.56 The Government’s impactassessment continues—that the primary benefit is to not allow disqualified persons access to bankingproducts and services to reduce the attractiveness of the UK as a place to stay for law breakers,57 movingaway from an economic well-being position.However, Gerards notes that, in practice, a legitimate aim does not seem to be of real importance tothe European Court of Human Rights. Gerards continues that the European Court of Human Rights usuallysolves the problem of legitimate aims by accepting very general and abstract aims, such as the “protectionof national security or respecting the rights and freedoms of others, as the basis for its examination of thejustifiability of interferences with fundamental rights”.58 For Gerards, this easy acceptance of very broadmeaningless terms adds very little to the reasoning of the European Court of Human Rights.59In summary, although it is relatively straightforward and easy for a legitimate aim to be satisfiedregarding current account checks, problems still persist. For instance, it can be argued that there has notbeen a legitimate aim that can be identified to justify the interference with art.8 because the Governmentdoes not believe art.8 to be engaged. Even if there was a legitimate aim, the justification used (public/generalinterest) does not fall within the list of exemptions in art.8(2). Moreover, the proportionality test wouldbe difficult to apply on the basis of broads aims, such as the “general interest”.60 Even if one were toconsider economic well-being as a justification, the impact assessment’s own figures suggest that s.40A(1)and the Regulation will have the opposite effect of safeguarding it. Thus, if the argument that theindiscriminate screening of 70 million current accounts serves no legitimate aim, this would amount to aviolation.6153Home Office, “Immigration Bill: European Convention on Human Rights Memorandum” (17 September 2015), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/462206/Immigration_Bill_ECHR_Memo.pdf [Accessed 1 August 2018], at [72].54D.

Are immigration checks necessary in a democratic society?For a measure to be “necessary in a democratic society,” interfering with those rights must correspond to“pressing social need,” it must be “proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued,” and the reasons givenby the national authorities to justify it must be “relevant and sufficient.”62Is there a pressing social need for immigration checks?The European Court of Human Rights has stressed that “necessary” in a democratic society is notsynonymous with “indispensable” but at the same this did not mean it encompassed expressions such as“admissible”, “ordinary”, “useful”, “reasonable” or “desirable”.63 This applies to the measure applyingthe law, and the law itself64 and thus demonstrates further why a temporary reduction cannot be consideredin isolation to s.40A(1) and the Regulation. To justify a pressing social need “[t]here must be a sufficientfactual basis for believing that there was a real danger to the interest which the State claims there was apressing social need to protect”.65 It is the duty of the State to demonstrate there is a pressing social need,66with the onus being significantly high.67 The EU’s Article 29 Data Protection Working Party (29WP)considers that a pressing social need asks:a. Is the measure seeking to address an issue which, if left unaddressed, may result in harm toor have some detrimental effect on society or a section of society?b. Is there any evidence that the measure may mitigate such harm?c. What are the broader views (societal, historic or political etc) of society on the issue inquestion?d. Have any specific views/opposition to a measure or issue expressed by society beensufficiently taken into account?68These questions will be used to assess the need for current account checks. According to the Government’simpact assessment, the need for this measure derives from the fact that, previously, it was not possible torestrict current accounts for disqualified persons before the IA 2014 and for those who had become adisqualified person.69 The Government continued that it intends to ensure that banks are required to checkfor current accounts held by known disqualified persons.70 This position does not reflect the wording ofs.40A(1) and the Regulation, as checks are not based upon checking current accounts of known disqualifiedpersons, but checking every current account, four times a year, every year on a precautionary basis. Sucha position is later acknowledged in the impact assessment.71 The Government does not address in whatways not having this provision would be detrimental to society or sections of it.

The impact assessment even admits that doingnothing has “no costs associated with it”72 and is therefore not detrimental to society.With regards to evidence that s.40A(1) and the Regulation might mitigate the occurrence of over stayers,the evidence is lacking (see more below). As the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigrationnoted:“[J]ustification for extending the ‘hostile environment’ measures is based on the conviction that theyare ‘right’ in principle, and enjoy broad public support, rather than on any evidence that the measuresalready introduced are working or need to be strengthened, since no targets were set for the originalmeasures and little has been done to evaluate them.”73The Home Affairs Committee heavily criticised the Government and found it unacceptable that it had“not yet made any assessment of the effectiveness of the74 ‘hostile environment’” and urgently called onthem to do so.With regards to broader views, the impact assessment makes no assessment on the human rightsimplications. The concerns lie with the effects on the banking industry.75 The Home Office’s ECHRmemorandum acknowledges that immigration checks engage art.6 (fair trial) and art.1 Protocol 1 (rightto property), but not art.8.76 Therefore, consideration for the protection of personal data does not evenfactor.Additionally, the impact assessment does not entertain the possibility of only checking current accountswhere there are reasonable and objective grounds to believe it belongs to a disqualified person. Moreover,the impact assessment acknowledges that after the first year, roughly 900 matches will be made77 despite70 million current accounts subject to checks on a continuous basis. Immigration current account checksdo not prevent those who seek to circumvent this provision from setting up overseas accounts,78 and inany event, are conducted “haphazardly, irregularly or without due and proper consideration”.79 On afundamental level, the link between current accounts and UK residency is never established, and thusraises more concerns about the necessity of the measure. There might be a pressing social need to removeover stayers by checking current accounts that are linked to them (which in and of itself would have tobe demonstrated), but there can be no pressing social need that subjects every current account to checkswith the aim of furthering the “hostile environment”.80 A failure to establish a pressing social need alsoresults in a violation.8172HMTreasury, “Immigration Bill: tackling existing current accounts held by illegal immigrants” (3 August 2015), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/462233/Immigration_Bill_bank_accounts_impact_assessment.pdf [Accessed 1August 2018], at [6].73Bolt, “An inspection of the ‘hostile environment’ measures relating to driving licences and bank accounts” (October 2016), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567652/ICIBI-hostile-environment-driving-licences-and-bank-accounts-January-to-July-2016.pdf [Accessed 1 August 2018], at [7.23].74Home Affairs Committee, Home Office delivery of Brexit: immigration (third report) (2017-19, HC 421), at [120].75HMTreasury, “Immigration Bill: tackling existing current accounts held by illegal immigrants” (3 August 2015), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/462233/Immigration_Bill_bank_accounts_impact_assessment.pdf [Accessed 1August 2018], at [19].76Home Office, “Immigration Bill: European Convention on Human Rights Memorandum” (17 September 2015), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/462206/Immigration_Bill_ECHR_Memo.pdf [Accessed 1 August 2018], at [68–76].77HMTreasury, “Immigration Bill: tackling existing current accounts held by illegal immigrants” (3 August 2015), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/462233/Immigration_Bill_bank_accounts_impact_assessment.pdf [Accessed 1August 2018], at [20].78 PBC (HC Bill 074) 2015–16, written evidence submitted by ILPA (IB 14B).79Roman Zakharov v Russia (47143/06) (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 17 at [257].80HMTreasury, “Immigration Bill: tackling existing current accounts held by illegal immigrants” (3 August 2015), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/462233/Immigration_Bill_bank_accounts_impact_assessment.pdf [Accessed 1August 2018], at [68].81Faber v Hungary (App No.40721/08), judgment of 24 July 2012 at [59].Your Immigration Status Please 359[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsRelevant and sufficient reasonsThis part of the “necessary in a democratic society” requirement82 concerns the effectiveness of a measure.83In difficult cases, the European Court of Human Rights relies upon “factual, statistical, or empiricalinformation as to the effectiveness of a certain measure”.84 If the margin of appreciation (discretion)85 ofa State is narrowed, then the demands of the effectiveness of a measure needs to be higher, which has tobe demonstrated and justified with evidence for the European Court of Human Rights to assess.86 TheEuropean Court of Human Rights have noted that States usually have a wide margin of appreciation whenassessing “the existence of a problem of public concern warranting specific measures and in implementingsocial and economic policies”.87However, as Gerards notes, if on the basis of empirical data, the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights finds:“[T]hat the means chosen were inadequate or unnecessary, there would be no need for it to investigatewhether, in the end, the legislature or the administration found a reasonable balance.”88As noted above, the Home Affairs Committee and the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders andImmigration have highlighted the fact that there is no evidence to back up the measures employed, whetherit be the “hostile environment” in general or current account checks. To remedy this, the Governmentintends to conduct an informal review of current account checks 12 months after implementation.89 It isproblematic that the said review will be conducted by HM Treasury and the Home Office, essentiallyassessing its own effectiveness. Such a task would be more appropriate for the Independent Chief Inspectorof Borders and Immigration which:“[M]onitors and reports on the efficiency and effectiveness of the immigration, asylum, nationalityand customs functions carried out by the Home Secretary and by officials and others on her behalf.”90Importantly, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration is independent of theGovernment91 unlike HM Treasury and the Home Office. There is no indication as to what an “informalreview” entails. There is no guarantee that such an informal reviewwill occur due to it not being mandatedby the IA 2014 or 2016. Section 45 of the IA 2016 does provide that the Secretary of State must reviewthe operation of s.40A and provide a report for Parliament within five years. This, again, should be a taskfor Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration whose reports are laid before Parliament.92Having the Home Office, HM Treasury and the Secretary of State conduct informal or formal reviews oftheir own effectiveness does not guarantee effective and adequate safeguards against abuse93 as theindependence of those reviews can be questioned.82 Smith and Grady v UK (33985/96) (2000) 29 E.H.R.R. 493 at [87–88].83Gerards, “How to improve the necessity test of the European Court of Human Rights” (2013) I•CON 11(2) 466, 473.84Gerards, “How to improve the necessity test of the European Court of Human Rights” (2013) I•CON 11(2) 466, 473.85A.

It also highlights that it is also not sufficient that current accounts are checkedby virtue of their existence because they are caught by a rule that permits the screening of all of them.Lastly, it demonstrates that it is the facts and circumstances of specified cases that are relevant whichwould become problematic for the UK Government if millions (or just one) current account holders arguethat their current accounts are being unnecessarily checked four times a year, every year, simply becausethey have one.Considering there is not sufficient evidence to demonstrate the need for s.40A(1) and the Regulation,the review of its effectiveness is tainted by a lack of independence, the current checks would fall under aparticular exception and/or a rule in general or absolute terms, it is argued that the Government has notgiven sufficient reasons to justify this measure, even if there is a wide margin of appreciation in thisparticular area. This would also violate art.8.96ProportionalityProportionally, though having many forms97 is often described “striking a fair balance”98 between theinterests (or right of the individual)99 at stake. There are several factors100 to consider when dealing withproportionality, but for the purposes of this article, only two aspects will be considered, that is, whetherthere was a least restrictive measure to achieve the objective, and whether a fair balance had been struckgiven all the circumstances.Brems and Lavrysen perfectly describe the least restrictive measure, a general principle of the ECHR101as using a nutcracker, instead of a sledgehammer, to crack a nut.102 For a measure to be proportionate andnecessary, the possibility of an alternative that is less damaging to fundamental rights which fulfils thesame aim must be ruled out. 103 This was demonstrated in Ürper and Others v Turkey which concernedthe complete prohibition on newspapers which published articles in support of the PKK, a Kurdishindependence movement.104 The European Court of Human Rights ruled that “that less draconian measurescould have been envisaged, such as the confiscation of particular issues of the newspapers or restrictionson the publication of specific articles”.105 Gerards notes the European Court of Human Right’s judgmentwas based on the “concrete and demonstrable existence of alternatives, which would have been less onerousyet equally effective”.106 Given that all current accounts are checked irrespective of whether there are94 Sunday Times v UK (A/30) (1979–80) 2 E.H.R.R. 245 at [65].95 Sunday Times v UK (1979–80) 2 E.H.R.R. 245 at [65].96 Sunday Times v UK (1979–80) 2 E.H.R.R. 245 at [63] and [67].97T.

The clear alternative is to run a check on current accounts wherethere are objective reasons for suspecting it belongs to a disqualified person. Having a temporary reductiondoes not change this position because it is unclear what criteria (such as reasonable objective suspicion)is used to reduce current account checks and in any event does not alter the fabric of s.40A(1) and theRegulation.The fair balance principle assesses the proportionality of the State’s conduct107 which can lead to theconsideration of other factors.108A personmay become disqualified due to a minor mistake in an applicationor by a missed deadline, or being unable to apply for further leave due to their documents being seizeddue to exploitation.109 As noted above, checks occur whether one has leave to remain, is making an appeal,or is not even an immigrant at all. Given that the Government anticipates 900 matches to disqualifiedpersons a year, against 70 million current accounts, the “rewards of the procedure appear disproportionatelysmall compared to the effort involved”.110The Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration noted that there was a 10% error rate forthe classification of disqualified persons.111 The Home Affairs Committee detailed the example of an errorwith the case of Dr Mohsen Danaie, who was incorrectly identified as a disqualified person, and wassubsequently told by the Home Office to leave immediately, or face six months in prison, be removed byforce and receive a ten-year ban on returning.112 The Independent Chief Inspector of Borders andImmigration told the Home Affairs Committee that it recommended that the Home Office check theaccuracy of its data before it is used for enforcement purposes, but the Home Office refused.113 This 10%error rate will only increase the amount of wrongly identified disqualified persons as the amount of currentchecks increase exponentially.The Home Office’s guidance for banks and building societies notes that if there is evidence thatcontradicts data held by a specified anti-fraud organisation or the Home Office which can demonstratethat individuals are not a disqualified person, only in exceptional circumstances should (though they arenot required to) they contact the Home Office, and the default is to refuse the application.114 This createsa presumption of being a disqualified person and is manifestly unfair.The European Court of Human Rights have already found indiscriminate measures to be incompatiblewith art. 8 for lack of proportionality.115 This disproportionality intensifies considering that current accountchecks occur four times a year indefinitely without differentiation or distinction. The unfairness contributesto the disproportionality, in that the Home Office refuses to check the accuracy of their own data whichwill lead to greater errors; advises banks and building societies to presume (despite evidence to the contrary)that an individual is a disqualified person; and the perceived benefit of 900 matches a year is outweighedby the nearly 70 million current accounts which customers will have their art.8 rights unnecessarilyinterfered with. For the reasons set out in this subsection, it is argued that current account checks constitutea disproportionate interference with art.8 and would thus amount to a violation.116107A.

When art.14 is considered to have a fundamentalaspect to a case, the European Court of Human Rights will consider it,119 even when the substantive righthas not been violated.120Article 14 requires there to be a difference in treatment of persons in analogous,or relevantly similar, situation, the situation does not need to be identical.121The Home Office’s ECHR Memorandum acknowledges the applicability of art.14 but only in relationto illegal working, driver’s licences and residential tenancies.122 The Home Office incorrectly ascribesnationality as a difference in treatment based on an “other status”123 when art.14 specifically refers tonational origin. The Home Office then states when the issue is a difference in treatment based onimmigration status, which involves an element of choice and is a socio-economic issue, the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights have stated that the margin of appreciation will be relatively wide.124 However,the European Court of Human Rights have stated that very weighty reasons have to justify the differencein treatment based exclusively on nationality.125 This argument does not need to be pursued because currentaccount checks are not dependent on nationality, which raises an altogether different art.14 issue.Relevantly, Thlimmenos-type discrimination occurs when:“States without an objective and reasonable justification fail to treat differently persons whosesituations are significantly different.”126To be justified, this type of discrimination also requires the measure to pursue a legitimate aim, and if itdoes, whether there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality between means employed and the aimsought to be realised.127Given that current account checks apply to anyone with a current account, whether they are a disqualifiedperson or not, this fails to treat differently those who are in a significantly different situation. There is noobjective justification for these measures because there is no evidence to justify them. They are notreasonable because they apply irrespective of situations and the legitimate aim is questionable (see above)given the miniscule number of current accounts that may belong to disqualified persons.My blog post on this asked several questions which highlight the lack of the reasonable relationship ofproportionality of s.40A(1) and the Regulation, which can be summarised as followed:117Airey v Ireland (A/32) (1979–80) 2 E.H.R.R. 305 at [30].118Chassagnou v France (25088/94) (2000) 29 E.H.R.R. 615 at [89]; Oršuš and Others v Croatia (15766/03) (2011) 52 E.H.R.R. 7 at [144].119Chassagnou v France (25088/94) (2000) 29 E.H.R.R. 615 at [89]; Oršuš and Others v Croatia (2011) 52 E.H.R.R. 7 at [144].120 Sommerfield v Germany (App No. 31871/96), judgment of 8 July 2003 at [84].121Clift v UK (App No.7205/07) judgment of 13 July 2010 at [66].122Home Office, “Immigration Bill: European Convention on Human Rights Memorandum” (17 September 2015), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/462206/Immigration_Bill_ECHR_Memo.pdf [Accessed 1 August 2018], at paras10 and 13.123Home Office, “Immigration Bill: European Convention on Human Rights Memorandum” (17 September 2015), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/462206/Immigration_Bill_ECHR_Memo.pdf [Accessed 1 August 2018], at para.10.124Home Office, “Immigration Bill: European Convention on Human Rights Memorandum” (17 September 2015), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/462206/Immigration_Bill_ECHR_Memo.pdf [Accessed 1 August 2018], at para.10.125Biao v Denmark (38590/10) (2017) 64 E.H.R.R. 1 at [93].126 Thlimmenos v Greece (34369/97) (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 15 at [44].127 Thlimmenos v Greece (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 15 at [46].Your Immigration Status Please 363[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors• If there is no reason to suspect that someone is a disqualified person, then why is animmigration check being conducted?• What is the objective reasonable justification for this?• If the aim is to match 6000 current accounts in the first year and 900 thereon after, and if aperson was never a disqualified person, why are the checks still occurring four times a year,every year?128If these questions cannot be adequately answered, and if one considers the previous subsection onproportionality, then it cannot be argued that there is a reasonable relationship of proportionality betweenthese checks and immigration control, and thus would amount to a violation of art.14 in conjunction withart.8.129Another art.14 issue arises when, although the Home Office did not acknowledge that art.14 may beengaged with regards to banking, the impact assessment accepted that such measures may “impact on theappetite of firms to offer banking services to legal migrants who do not have permanent leave to remain”due to them being risk averse.130 This therefore creates a prima facie art.14 issue. As the Immigration LawPractitioners Association have noted:“[W]ill have a disproportionate impact on certain racial groups, with severe consequences forindividuals whose bank accounts are wrongly closed or frozen mistakenly creating many otherassociated problems such as homelessness and adverse impact on children. Such measures couldcontribute to a climate of misunderstanding and ethnic profiling.”131This is a relevant observation given that Blackstone Solicitors are taking high street banks to court regardingconcerns of racially discriminating against Iranian nationals with regards to closures of their accounts.132Therefore, this argument simply highlights that discrimination beyond a Thlimmenos-type discriminationis possible.Post-Brexit Data Protection AdequacyOn 24 June 2016 the UK voted in a referendum to leave the EU. Although leaving the EU has no legalimplications for the relationship between the UK and the ECHR (although the UK Government seeks tohonour a mutual commitment with the EU that it will remain party to the ECHR post-Brexit),133 the ECHRwill have implications for the UK and EU post-Brexit. Using the discussion above on current accountchecks illustrates this. When the UK actually leaves as intended on 29 March 2019 it will become a thirdcountry for the purposes of data protection. Chapter V of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)134governs the transfer of personal data to third countries. Article 45(1) highlights that such transfers areonly permissible if the Commission decides that the third country in question has an adequate level ofdata protection. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) have ruled that third countries have128White, “Guest Post: Your Immigration Status, Please!” (9 January 2018), https://paulbernal.wordpress.com/2018/01/09/guest-post-your-immigration-status-please/ [Accessed 1 August 2018].129 Thlimmenos v Greece (34369/97) (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 15 at [55].130HMTreasury, “Immigration Bill: tackling existing current accounts held by illegal immigrants” (3 August 2015), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/462233/Immigration_Bill_bank_accounts_impact_assessment.pdf [Accessed 1August 2018], at [63]-[64].131 PBC (HC Bill 074) 2015–16, written evidence submitted by ILPA (IB 14B).132S.

It does “notsee any reason for existing data flows from third countries to the UK to be interrupted”138 because of its“exceptionally high standards of data protection”.139 This, however, overlooks the Commission’s findingof several deficiencies within the current UK data protection framework.140The Home Affairs Committee highlighted several obstacles for the UK in its pursuit of being foundadequate, namely:• In the process of making an adequacy decision, the EUmay examine the UK’s data protectionregime relating to national security legislation, including controversial powers conferred bythe Investigatory Powers Act 2016;• It is not clear that the Government has sufficiently incorporated the EU Charter ofFundamental Rights into UK law, most importantly in relation to data protection;• The Data Protection Bill, which the Government claims incorporates the Charter’s dataprotection elements, contains provisions that may cause problems when seeking an adequacydecision;• The UK’s onward transfer of EU data to “Five Eyes” countries, including the USA, is likelyto come under scrutiny by the EU; and• The Government’s red line on the future direct jurisdiction of the CJEU may also causeproblems for UK negotiators.141Since these observations, the UK has decided not to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rightsinto domestic law post-Brexit by virtue of s.5(4) of the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018. It has also incorporatedan immigration exemption in the DPA 2018 which creates another adequacy obstacle.142 In addition tothis, Murray argues that reliance on art.8 may not be sufficient to obtain adequacy.143 Be that as it may,the purpose of this article is to demonstrate that the UK does not even comply with art.8, and therefore,in and of itself creates adequacy obstacles. Pounder suggests that any divergence from the European Courtof Human Rights in relation to data protection would make the UK inadequate.144 When the Commissionis making an adequacy decision, art.45(2) of the GDPR stipulates that they should take into account thefollowing elements:135 Schrems v Data Protection Commissioner (C-362/14) [2015] E.C.R.

In relation to b), given that current account checks are argued to not be inaccordance with the law, whose legitimate aim is questionable, not be necessary in a democratic societyand are discriminatory, it is argued that fundamental rights and freedoms are not respected. In relation toc), this applies insofar as it relates to a specific law, namely s.40A(1) of the IA 2014 and the Regulation.Regarding d), although the UK does have an independent regulator for data protection, the InformationCommissioner, in which the Commission already has concerns,145 in the specific context of current accountchecks, it is the Government that will assess the effectiveness of the measure, which would raise concernsregarding the independence of any findings. With regards to e), the UK is a Council of Europe MemberState and is subject to ECHR and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, and bydemonstrating that current account checks violate art.8 and art.8 in conjunction with art.14, it shows thatthe UK is not committing to its legally binding conventions. For these reasons, it is argued that s.40A(1)of the IA 2014 and the Regulation creates yet another obstacle for the UK in pursuit of a post-Brexitadequacy finding.ConclusionsThis article has considered powers within s.40A(1) of the IA 2014 and the accompanying Regulationwhich compels banks and building societies to run immigration checks on current accounts four times ayear, every year and its compatibility with art.8. In doing so, this article argues that the powers that compelcurrent account checks (even if temporarily reduced) is very unlikely to, or does not satisfy, many of therequirements of art.8(2) in that a measure has to be in accordance with the law, pursue a legitimate aimand be necessary in a democratic society. This article further argues that current account checks alsoviolate art.14 in conjunction with art.8 in that it fails to demonstrate a reasonable relationship ofproportionality, it fails treat those in a significantly different situation differently and there is the realpotential for direct discrimination. Failing to comply with obligations under the ECHRwill create obstaclesfor a finding that the UK has adequate data protection laws as the Commission has to consider whetherthe third country adheres to the rule of law, respects human rights and is committed to their legally bindinginternational obligations.

On 7 February 2018, Bermuda became the first state in modern history to withdraw theright of same-sex couples to marry, bucking the trend of progressively affording rights. In a recentjudgment, the Bermudian Supreme Court has ruled that taking away the right of same-sex couples tomarry is unconstitutional. This article will briefly consider the development of the right of same-sex couplesto marry in Bermuda, the connection between Bermudian human rights law and the European Conventionon Human Rights and ask whether rights afforded under a constitutional arrangement can be taken away.IntroductionOn 7 February 2018, Bermuda’s Governor approved the Domestic Partnership Act 2018 which withdrawsthe right for same-sex couples to marry in Bermudawith effect from 1 June 2018.

There is a substantial body of writing2 in the UK on whether the Civil Partnershipestablished under the Civil Partnership Act 2004 was in fact equal to marriage, or whether creating asecond form of legal partnership also created a subordinate form of legal partnership.3 Furthermore, therecent decision of the UK Supreme Court4 declaring5 that the provisions of the Civil Partnership Act 2004which restrict civil partnerships to same-sex couples only, are incompatible with arts 14 and 86 of theConvention, is a telling sign of the direction of progress in the UK law on partnership.7 Both these ideas*Teaching Associate in Law at the University of Bristol.1This article is solely concerned with legal marriage and not with religious marriage.2 For example, some perceptions are that the previous reservation of marriage for opposite-sex couples creates a hierarchy of legal partnership.Professor Howard NeJaime said in R.

This may not, however, be the end of the story.8 On 20 February 2018,a Bermudian lawyer filed a motion asking for the Supreme Court of Bermuda to consider whether theDomestic Partnership Act 2017 (DPA) is consistent with the Bermudian Human Rights Act 1981 (HRA)and the Bermudian Constitution. In a judgment handed down on 7 June 2018,9 the Supreme Court agreedthat legislating against same-sexmarriage was not permitted by the constitution and so the specific provisionof the DPA was declared inoperative. More recently, on 6 July 2018 the Bermudian government statedthat it is to appeal the decision of the Supreme Court of Bermuda in Ferguson.10 This matter is fast-pacedand the role of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council should be considered tentatively in light ofany appeal beyond the Court of Appeal.This article will aim to consider novel constitutional and human rights perspectives on same-sexmarriagein Bermuda. It will consider whether the Bermudian Constitution is capable of growing using the livingtree doctrine, established for the Canadian constitution. It will seek to draw a link between human rightsin Bermuda, the UK and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). A number of theoreticalprinciples from the UK and Europe will be drawn in to expand on the constitutional matters aroundsame-sex marriage in Bermuda. Principles such as equality and the rule of law, majority rule and identitythinking will all be included to foster discussion in this area. Throughout this article, the concept of theliving tree and its associated doctrine will be revisited; it is therefore prudent to first consider the livingtree doctrine.Gifting a constitutional treeIt has long been established that legislative and common law inconsistencies arise across theCommonwealth, and that the result of these inconsistencies can lead to questions before the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council (JCPC).11 This has happened across the jurisdictions of Commonwealthand often leads to innovative doctrines being established. A salient example of this is a seminal caseconcerning the Canadian Constitution, decided before the JCPC in the early twentieth century. The caseof Edwards12 is a point of interest as it established a constitutional theory known as the “living tree”doctrine. Simply put, this doctrine asserts that the Canadian Constitution is a living or organic entity thatmust develop and evolve as the society it represents evolves. This case came about when a challenge wasbrought to the ban on women becoming senators in Canada. In handing down their judgment, the CanadianSupreme Court felt that women should continue not to be eligible for two reasons: first, that women underthe Canadian common law were not permitted to hold office; secondly, women were not “persons” usinga narrow reading of the word “persons” found in the relevant Act,13 and the male emphasis in s.24.14 Usingboth the Common Law principle and the intrinsic aid above, the Canadian Supreme Court maintained theprohibition on women becoming Canadian senators. However, on appeal to the JCPC, the prevailingauthority that had persuaded the Canadian Supreme Court came under the direct scrutiny of the JCPC; inhanding down its judgment, the Court said:8E. Farge, “Bermudian lawyer goes to court to challenge gay marriage reversal” (20 February 2018), Reuters World News, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bermuda-gaymarriage/bermudian-lawyer-goes-to-court-to-challenge-gay-marriage-reversal-idUSKCN1G401N?il=0 [Accessed 1 August2018].9Ferguson [2018] SC (Bda) 45 Civ.10 J. Bell, “Government appeals same-sex ruling” (6 July 2018) The Royal Gazette, http://www.royalgazette.com/news/article/20180705/government-appeals-same-sex-ruling [Accessed 1 August 2018].11FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC [2014] UKSC 45; [2015] A.C. 250, Lord Neuberger at [45].12Edwards v Canada [1930] A.C. 124, 1929 UKPC 86.13British North America Act 1867.14British North America Act 1867.368 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors“their Lordships do not think it right to apply rigidly to Canada of to-day the decisions and thereasonings therefor which commended themselves, probably rightly, to those who had to apply thelaw in different circumstances, in different centuries to countries in different stages of development.”15This is a departure from the reserved approach taken by the domestic courts in Canada and the adoptionof, arguably, a judicial activist16 approach to ensuring that the laws of Canada reflect common and popularmorality. It is also possible to argue that the JCPC introduced—or at least considered—equality beforethe law17 when giving its opinion. Equality before the law will be addressed later in the article.The judgment refers to “[planting] in Canada a living tree capable of growth and expansion within itsnatural limits”.18 This idea of a gift by the UK legislature, of a growing and evolving constitution in Canada,is a particularly relevant point when considering the current above-mentioned issue in Bermuda. If thegift of a constitution by the UK to a Commonwealth country is an evolving gift which is everything butstagnant, then it follows to reason that the Bermuda Constitution Act 1967 and the Bermuda ConstitutionOrder 1968 have also gifted a living organic constitution to reflect the society that it serves. If theConstitution is living, then the rights contained within it can be expanded upon in the same way that theCanadian constitutional rights were expanded to include women senators. Two questions arise here: first,is the Bermudian HRA sufficient in its authority to expand upon constitutional rights. Secondly, can theConstitution in its living nature contract as well as expand; can it allow for the removal of rights whichhave lawfully been given? In considering whether the Constitution can contract, will UK common lawon removing rights that have been given influence any potential appeal to the JCPC in the withdrawal ofsame-sexmarriage in Bermuda? The case of Blackburn19 is often cited when the discussionmoves towardsremoval of rights. In Blackburn, Lord Denning exclaimed that “[f]reedom once given cannot be takenaway. Legal theory must give way to practical politics”. Though this article does not assert Lord Denning’swords as some form of authority, it does invite discussion on the merit of such a proposition. In relationto Bermuda, there are some fundamental questions to answer including whether allowing same-sex couplesto marry would amount to giving a right to those in a same-sex relationship. In any event, should thematter come before the JCPC, would the Privy Council see it as its role to apply the logic found in theaforementioned statement in Blackburn literally? Whatever approach is taken, should the JCPC becomeinvolved in this matter there is a warning of caution to sound, given that the Progressive Labour Party,which is currently in government in Bermuda, has always been vocal about its desire for independence.20Any tension between the JCPC and the domestic courts in Bermuda may give weight to the ProgressiveLabour Party’s agenda.Development of same-sex marriage in BermudaOn the question of allowing same-sex couples to marry, this is not as straightforward as it may first seem.The right of same-sex couples to marry came about following a ruling of the Supreme Court of BermudainW. Godwin et al,21which found that theMarriage Act 1944 was discriminatory in not allowing same-sexcouples to marry. The Supreme Court of Bermuda issued a mandatory order requiring the registrar to15Edwards v Canada [1930] A.C. 124, 1929 UKPC 86.16B. Wilson, “The Making of a Constitution: Approaches to Judicial Interpretation” [1988] Public Law 370.17Equality before the law has a long and diverse history in the UK and has been codified in many written constitutions. It has been argued that itforms part of the Rule of Law by notable theorists such as Dicey and Dworkin amongst others (see J.W.F. Allison (ed.), A.V. Dicey, Introduction tothe Study of the Law of the Constitution (Oxford University Press, 2013, first published 1885) and R. Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously (London:Duckworth, 1978)). There are many opinions on equality before the law and the connection with formal and substantive views of the Rule of Lawmakes for a lengthy discussion. For more information, see P. Craig, “Formal and Substantive Conceptions of the Rule of Law: AnAnalytical Framework”[1997] Public Law 467.18Edwards v Canada [1930] A.C. 124, 1929 UKPC 86.19Blackburn v Attorney General [1971] EWCA Civ 7; 1 W.L.R 1037.20 Progressive Labour Party, “1972–1985” (2018) History, http://www.plp.bm/history [Accessed 1 August 2018].21W. Godwin et al v Registrar General [2017] SC (Bda) 36 Civ.Bermuda’s Domestic Partnership Act 2018: From “Living Tree” to Broken Branches? 369[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorspublish banns of marriage for those same-sex couples that apply, and as such the right to marry becameextant both domestically and onboard approved ships registered in Bermuda. This latter point is noteworthy,given that many large cruise lines have ships that are registered in Bermuda and so can offer same-sexmarriage onboard their vessels.22 Since the judgment of the Supreme Court of Bermuda in May 2017, theGovernor of Bermuda has given Royal Assent to the DPAwhich withdraws the ability of same-sex couplesto marry23 and the DPA took effect from 1 June 2018. Additionally, a number of legal challenges werebrought in the case of Ferguson24; this will be considered below. Although the right was arguably createdby the Bermudian common law, it is relevant here to apply some distinctly European (andmore-so British)legal reasoning to this issue, given that Bermuda is a British Overseas Territory and has very close reciprocallinks with both the UK and Europe.Looking at this matter from a rather Dworkinian perspective, it is reasonable to argue thatGodwin couldbe an example of a Dworkinian “hard case”.25 The Supreme Court in Bermuda drew on equitable principles(considering equality in the prescription of rights) and, in turn, espoused a new rule.26 The rule previouslydid not exist, and so in creating a rule the Court is imputing its inherent morality onto the statute book.Though this article does not have the scope to enter into jurisprudential arguments on judicial activismand ethics in hard cases, it is nonetheless a relevant (if not subtle) point to note. In taking away theserights, there is arguably an assault on the concept of justice and equality before the law. The SupremeCourt of Bermuda decided the case in the way that it did, as the Marriage Act 1944 was perceived to beincompatible with the provisions of Bermuda’s HRA. The HRA states that a person is discriminatedagainst if they are treated less favourably than another because of, inter alia, that person’s sexualorientation.27 Though reasonable lawyers and lay people alike will disagree on the fundamental matter ofsame-sex marriage, the judgment of the Supreme Court in W. Godwin is logical and coherent. It is alsoworth drawing attention to a connected point—Bermuda recognises the ECHR28 and the HRA specifiesthat these rights apply in Bermuda. This was previously recognised, as the UK had extended the ECHRto “virtually the whole dependent empire” in 1953,29 following the UK’s ratification of the 1950Convention.30 Therefore, the provisions contained within the Convention are not novel in the Bermudiancourts or to the Bermudian legislature. Notwithstanding, Bermuda, as withmost British Overseas Territories,has a very complex relationship with the ECHR and with Strasbourg’s jurisprudence.31 Despite this, thereis some inconsistencywithin Bermudian law regarding the protections from discrimination that are afforded.According to the Schedule to the Constitution of Bermuda: Forms of Oaths and Affirmations, “no lawshall make any provision which is discriminatory either of itself or in its effect”.32 Although this seems tobe clear in its assertion, s.12(4)(c) of the same Schedule states that the protection from discrimination22Carnival Corporation, “Carnival Corporation Statement Regarding Bermuda’s Domestic Partnership Act” (2018) News Release, http://www.carnivalcorp.com/phoenix.zhtml%3Fc%3D200767%26p%3Dirol-newsArticle%26ID%3D2340880 [Accessed 1 August 2018].23Government of Bermuda, “Governor signs Domestic Partnership Act” (7 February 2018) News, https://www.gov.bm/articles/governor-signs-domestic-partnership-act#, [Accessed 1 August 2018].24Ferguson [2018] SC (Bda) 45 Civ.25R.

It is commonly accepted thathuman rights are generally thought of as being constitutional in nature, as they enshrine natural rightswhich are accepted internationally. However, it is prudent to consider the status of the HRA in an attemptto establish how constitutional it is in terms of Bermudian law. The Bermudian HRA does have a statuswhich is over and above that of ordinary laws, as it allows the Supreme Court of Bermuda to declare anAct “inoperative” if it conflicts with the provisions of the HRA. A good recent example of this occurredin A and B.36 In 2010, the JCPC has previously gone as far as to call the Bermudian HRA aquasi-constitutional document,37 and in Bermuda Bred Co the Supreme Court of Bermuda compared theauthority it receives from the HRA to declare an Act inoperable with the power to strike down laws thatconflict with the Bermudian Constitution.38 In Bermuda Bred Co the Court states that although:“the rights protected by the HRA do not enjoy quite as elevated a status as the fundamental rightsand freedoms provisions of the Constitution, Parliament has clearly conferred on this statutequasi-constitutional status.”However, in both Bermuda Bred Co and in A and B the courts took a “generous and purposive approach”to applying the HRA, and followed the higher standard of rights that were allocated under the HRA asopposed to the constitutional rights which precluded express protections for same-sex couples. Using thisas a guide, it would seem to indicate that the HRA has given the courts the ability to liberally interpretthe Constitution in light of the protections that are available under the HRA and thus expanding upon therights already afforded under the Constitution. If this is in fact the case, it is another example of aconstitution evolving to keep abreast of not just national, but international, changes in attitudes to rights.It is another demonstration of a living tree growing to reflect society. In support of the assertion that theconvention grows positively to protect rights opposed to contracting to curtail rights, the recent case ofLendore39 cited the earlier European Court of Human Rights case of Tyrer,40 where the European Courtof Human Rights described the European Convention on Human Rights as:“a living instrument which … must be interpreted in the light of present day conditions … the courtcannot but be influenced by the developments and commonly accepted standards in the penal policyof the member states of the Council of Europe.”4133 For more on the interaction between territorial law and personal law, see H.

There were a large number of points raised in the judgment and this article could not feasiblyconsider them all with equal respect. As such, a small number of points have been selected to foster thepublic law and human rights discussions around this topic.The first of such matters is the Court’s summary dismissal of the argument that the judgment in W.Godwin amounted to “legislating from the bench”.42 This is an interesting point, though not particularlywell thought out. The Supreme Court appropriately identified that Parliamentary Sovereignty in Bermudais a qualified concept—one that states that the legislature is entitled to legislate “for the peace, order andgood government of Bermuda”43 according to the Constitution. This limitation must, by its inclusion inthe Constitution, have an adjudicative venue to resolve disputes. The Bermudian Supreme Court is thereforea constitutional court, given that it possesses the power to resolve and decide matters of a constitutionalnature. There will undoubtedly be some envy from the UK Supreme Court, whose status as a constitutionalcourt is a matter of much debate.44 The Court in Ferguson also cited a recent discussion on this matter ofRobinson,45 where Nazerath JA stated that the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 makes any law which inincompatible with the Bermudian Constitution void. Kawaley CJ summarised to that effect that:“the Legislative branch of Government has not for 50 years had more than qualified Parliamentarysovereignty in Bermuda. The Judiciary has been tasked by Chapter I of the Bermuda Constitutionwith ensuring that both executive action and legislative provisions do not contravene the fundamentalrights of freedoms of the citizens and residents of Bermuda.”46This poses some interesting conceptual questions, one being that the separation of powers in BritishOverseas Territories are subject to caveats, viz that the judiciary retains the right to curtail the parliament’ssovereignty if the judiciary feels that the parliament is legislating contrary to the constitution. In Bermuda,is it more appropriate to talk of constitutional supremacy supported by judicial superiority, and thesubjugation to some extent of the legislature?Although this last statement is intentionally evocative, there are some connected points to make on itfrom the Ferguson judgment which will be transposed in the opposite direction on current affairs in theUK. A statement from the affidavit of an intervener in the case, cited a quote which raises some furtherrelevant points. The statement reads:“In any event, even if a majority of Bermudians were in favour of depriving a minority group of itshuman rights … it would be wholly inappropriate for Government to legislate on that basis … Incivilised societies, the majority does not get to pick and choose which of a minority’s human rightsshould and should not be protected. In fact, in a great many instances the oppressive views of themajority are exactly what minorities most need their human rights to be protected against.”This statement directly conflicts with the prevailing concept of majority rule. However, this is notnovel—criticisms of law-making based on popular policy are long-standing.47 It is not unreasonable toconclude that human rights matters should be beyond the influence of majority rule in order that they are42 Tyrer (1978) 2 E.H.R.R. 1 at [39].43Bermuda Constitution Order 1968.44Lord Neuberger, “The UK Constitutional Settlement and the UK Supreme Court” (10 October 2014) speech at the Legal Wales Conference 2014,https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/speech-141010.pdf [ Accessed 1 August 2018].45Robinson v R [2009] Bda LR 40.46Ferguson [2018] SC (Bda) 45 Civ at [43].47W.

For example, in SAS48 theEuropean Court of Human Rights considered France’s ban on full-face covering in public in an attemptto incite cohesion and a sense of community. In terms of whether this is feasible, attention needs to beturned to the concept of “identity thinking” and its relevance in human rights matters.49 In brief, identitythinking asserts that every person is “commensurable and identical” through an exchanging of unequalideas known as “barter”.50AsAdorno put it, “identity becomes the authority for the doctrine of adjustment”51and this concept fundamentally underpins human rights theory. According to Nicholson, equality beforethe law and universal rights are predicated on the standard for equality, being the concept of the community.The community decides who is a member of it and so who is entitled to human rights and protections.52This, arguably over-simplistic explanation, does however fit with the idea of majority rule, but poses alegal problem connected to majority rule. Society inevitably adapts and changes at different rates indifferent countries. The geo-political influence cannot be downplayed, and this can be seen in anecdotalstatements in the media asserting that the majority of people in Bermuda are against same-sex marriage.The question then becomes, does majority rule legitimise discrimination?When a community decides notto include an individual, as that individual does not accord with the community’s inherent identity, wheredoes that leave the individual? To draw these points together, if the majority of Bermudian people opposesame-sex marriage and that formed the basis for political policy-making, then those same-sex couples areostensibly ostracised from the marriage community. It is the role of the courts in Bermuda, in pursuanceof their constitutional nature, to uphold the egalitarian nature of the Constitution and rule against the willof the majority to impose equality. Each reader will of course come to their own conclusion on whetherthis is acceptable or not. However, given the very brief mention made of identity-thinking and humanrights, and without affording further consideration to the impact and influence of European legal theoryin the Caribbean,53 it is still possible to conclude that the court in Ferguson was right to be influenced bythe assertion that the “majority” are against same-sex marriage. By putting too much weight on this, theCourt would have reinforced the concept of majority rule to the detriment of equality before the law. Thereare some comments in the Ferguson judgment that seem to indicate that the legislature had given weightto representative pressure groups when attempting to ban same-sex marriage. It is rather obvious to suggestthat government is invariably interested in the opinion of the general public given that the governmenthas its democratic mandate because of the public. In the earlier mentioned SAS case, the French statebanned all full-face coverings and this, in turn, is the state as a community ostracising those who choseto wear the niqab, for example. The community is stating that there is an identity which is incompatiblewith the community and so must either change or suffer exclusion. Yet, in Bermuda this is not the case;the judiciary exercised its authority over the government, and in turn the legislature, to set aside the willof the majority in favour of inclusion. The community is, by virtue of the judgment, forced to includesame-sex couples; this could hopefully lead to the normalisation of same-sex marriage within thecommunity. It could alternatively lead to hostility or resentment either towards same-sex couples or theBermudian Supreme Court itself. Baroness Hale’s statement in Ghaindan54 is also cited in the Fergusoncase, when the court is referring to the case of Re P,55 where Baroness Hale said, “democracy valueseveryone equally even if the majority does not”.48 SAS v France (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 11.49An excellent discussion of this is available in M.

If the latter were true, then there would also be scope to arguethat a religiously charged law is permissible under the Constitution. The Court discussed this at lengthand in its judgment included statements from the Supreme Courts of Bermuda,58 Canada59 and the UK allstressing that their respective constitutions are secular. However, the Court then goes on to find that theDPA has a religious motive in part, but that this is not sufficient enough to draw its validity into question.It is proposed that another aspect has been neglected somewhat and only mentioned in passing during thejudgment. InMcFarlane,60 Laws LJ clarified that art.9 of the ECHR is absolute in its protection of rightsto hold or not hold a religion. The right to manifest a religious belief is subject to limitation; these havebeen discussed extensively in both UK domestic courts61 and at the European Court of Human Rights.62Whether the Constitution is secular only satisfies half of the argument, even if the Constitution was notsecular (which it is63).Whether the HRAwould permit the government to put forward a bill which manifestsits religious belief in a discriminatory way is another matter entirely. In this case the relationship betweenthe Constitution and the HRA is significant on several levels—if the HRA expands on the Constitutionthen the Constitution would be “in harmony” with the HRA and its principles, including those emanatingfrom European human rights jurisprudence, given the HRA’s recognition statement. The impact of theHRA on the Constitution and whether it has any material impact on the Constitution needs to be consideredfurther.Living tree or broken branchesThe case of Ferguson has raised some issues which are relatively infrequently addressed in Bermudiandomestic courts. Having rights, provided under the common law which are consistent with the HRA as aquasi-constitutional statute, taken away by an ordinary law is inconsistent with most UK jurisprudenceand legal theory,64 though there seems to be limited Bermudian case-law to refer to in this area. Given thatthe UK jurisprudencemay inevitably filter into the argument if thematter is appealed beyond the BermudianCourt of Appeal65 to the JCPC, someUK points will be considered to add flesh to the bones of the argument.Earlier, reference was made to Blackburn and specifically to Lord Denning’s point that “[f]reedomonce given cannot be taken away”. It could be argued that a legislature could legislate to remove rights—theUK Parliament could repeal the Human Rights Act 1998 and withdraw from the ECHR and all proceedingdomestic laws on rights and civil liberties, and therefore remove rights from the individual. However, thisis an abstract argument given that doing so would invariably result in a considerable, politically chargeddiscourse. There is also a common law presumption in the UK that Parliament does not legislate contraryto the common law unless it does so explicitly.66 Although the DPA seems express and certain in both itswording and its intention, there is a slightly confusing caveat that has been included in s.53 which was a56Ferguson [2018] SC (Bda) 45 Civ, summarised at [67]–[70].57Ferguson [2018] SC (Bda) 45 Civ, summarised at [67]–[70].58Centre for Justice v Attorney-General and Minister for Legal Affairs [2016] Bda LR 140.59R v Big M Drug Mart (1985) 1 SCR 295.60McFarlane v Relate Avon Ltd [2010] EWCA Civ 880.61R.

App. R. 157.374 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsdisputed section in the Ferguson case. The first phrase states “[n]otwithstanding anything in the HumanRights Act 1981…”. Given that the HRA specifically precludes less-favourable treatment on the basis ofsexual orientation, it is difficult to reconcile s.53 of the DPA with s.2(2)(a)(ii) of the HRA, specifically.Whether this is the government’s attempt to legitimise the revocation of same-sex marriage by includinga reference to the HRA, and to attempt to persuade the public that due consideration has been given tothe HRA, is unclear. The Bermudian government states that the DPA gives a statutory right to all couplesto enter into a legally recognised partnership, but the result of that is simply that same-sex couples couldno longer get married. This does directly discriminate against same-sex couples as (using the standard setout in s.2 of the HRA) same-sex couples cannot enter into a legal marriage and so are treated less favourably,thus making out the grounds for discrimination under the Bermudian HRA. There are material differencesbetween the domestic partnership and marriage, though the one difference that seemed to hold weightwith the court in Ferguson was the international recognition of partnerships as sub-standard to marriage,according to Professor Howard NeJaime.67 Given that the DPA does in fact discriminate against same-sexcouples, the Supreme Court of Bermuda is correct in declaring that the DPA is inoperable, as the HRAcarries the quasi-constitutional status mentioned earlier. The point which is due discussion is whether thequasi-constitutional HRA is “in harmony” with the Bermudian Constitution, and if it is adequateconsideration needs to be given to the impact of matters such as the art.9 limitations on manifestation ofbeliefs and the making of religiously charged laws.As mentioned, the Bermudian Constitution includes a clause exempting marriage68 from discriminatoryprotection, whereas the HRA does not and so the discriminatory protections contained in the HRA doapply to marriage.69 Here, a somewhat theoretical approach needs to be taken to answering the question.In the Bermudian case of A v Attorney General,70 the Supreme Court grapples with a post-constitutionstatute (the Companies Act 1981), which seems inconsistent with the constitution. The Court affirmedthat it is the duty of a court to construe an Act “subject to the presumption of constitutionality” if it precedesthe Bermuda Constitution Order 1968. Where this is not possible, it must declare that the later Act isrepugnant in accordance with the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865. The presumption of constitutionalityasserts that an Act passed is constitutional unless a subject can prove that it is not.71 Given that the HRAhas not yet been declared repugnant to the Constitution, it is possible that the former option, viz the HRA,is being read compatibly with the Constitution and so affording rights in addition to the Constitution istrue. This is, however, a weak assumption as it is based on the lack of evidence to the contrary in termsof the common law and logical reasoning. Notwithstanding, assuming that the HRA is compatible withthe Constitution, the constitutional rights have, therefore, been extended under the HRA to includediscrimination protections for same-sex couples, and these are not exclusive of marriage as was originallythe case.There is an alternative argument which should be considered—does the HRA provide protection againstdiscrimination based on sexual orientation, save for the marriage exception which is found in para.12(4)(c)of the Constitution? In order to make this argument fit, a number of Commonwealth principles need tobe ignored including (but not limited to), the living tree doctrine established in the Canadian constitutionalcase and the logic invoked by Lord Denning in Blackburn above. The statement of the Supreme Court ofBermuda in A v Attorney Generalwould also need to be reviewed; it would no longer be sufficient to readan Act compatibly with the presumption of constitutionality, the Act would need to be construed as toapply subject to any exceptions which can be found in the Constitution. This seems like a considerable67Ferguson [2018] SC (Bda) 45 Civ at [19].68 It also exempts personal law, though this article does not consider this matter further as it warrants its own independent piece.69Godwin and DeRoche v The Registrar General and others [2017] SC (Bda) 36 Civ.70A v Attorney General [2017] SC (Bda) 90 Civ.71E.

From this, it is possible to argue the judgment in Ferguson is a strongone, even if the reasoning in this article differs from that in the judgment. In addition, over the past twodecades the move in Commonwealth countries from all corners of the world has been to expand theirconstitutional rights to include same-sex marriage; jurisdictions such as Canada,72 Australia,73 Malta,74South Africa,75 Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha76 have either allowed, or are due to allow,same-sex marriage. Even the remote islands of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands allowsame-sex marriage.77 As the Bermudian legislature has chosen to appeal the decision in Ferguson, it is“bucking the trend” considerably in the progression of rights across the Commonwealth. Bermuda’s recentenactment of the DPA plots a substantially different course to that of Commonwealth countries mentionedabove, and it is right to question if such an attempted divergence in rights is consistent with the objectivesof the Commonwealth. Though Bermuda is itself not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, it is aBritish Overseas Territory and the Commonwealth of Nations sees the people who live in “associated andoverseas territories” as “part of the Commonwealth family”.78 It is therefore not necessary to draw adistinction between Bermuda and Commonwealth countries given that the perception of the Commonwealthof Nations is that a link exists between it and overseas territories of full members.As the UK is a Member of the Commonwealth of Nations, it is incumbent upon the UK to lead itsterritories towards compliance with the Charter’s aims. Although it is recognised that other Commonwealthnations do discriminate against LGBT+ people, this should not justify the UK’s acquiescence towards theCharter’s aims. The Charter of the Commonwealth is a set of values that each Commonwealth state signsto uphold and embody. Within the values can be found two statements: the first, “We note that these rightsare universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and cannot be implemented selectively”,79 andsecondly, “We emphasise the need to promote tolerance, respect, understanding … and recall that respectfor the dignity of all human beings is critical to promoting peace and prosperity”.80 Although the Charterdoes not protect LGBT+ rights by specifically stating them, the phrases “rights cannot be implementedselectively” and “respect for the dignity of all human beings” fit well with the earlier mentioned notionof equality before the law as a fundamental constitutional right. It is acknowledged that the author isattempting to draw specifics from a vague statement and that this poses several inherent challenges,however statements written in vague terms can have longevity as they can apply to the ever-changingshape of society. Therefore, it is not problematic to attempt to apply these vague statements to modernsociety, though it is problematic to close one’s ears to potential criticisms of that exercise. LGBT+ rightsin the Commonwealth are a matter attracting much media coverage81 and so a jurisdiction moving againstthe grain on this matter would inevitably come under the spotlight of public scrutiny. Notwithstandingthese points, and drawing back to the purely legal question of the inoperability of the DPA, given thestrength of feeling that the Bermudian government seem to have demonstrated in favour of the DPA, itis possible that the matter will eventually end up before the JCPC. If that does happen, it will offer theJCPC the opportunity to mend the broken branches and treat the constitutional tree. However, should the72Civil Marriage Act 2005.73D.McKeown, “Chronology of same-sexmarriage bills introduced into the federal parliament: a quick guide” (Research Papers 2017/18, Parliamentof Australia, 2018), https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1718/Quick_Guides/SSMarriageBills [Accessed 1 August 2018].74Marriage Act 2017.75Civil Union Act 2006.76Marriage Ordinance 2017.77By virtue of its legal relationship with the UK.78Commonwealth of Nations, “Associated and Overseas Territories” (2018) Commonwealth Membership, http://www.commonwealthofnations.org/commonwealth/commonwealth-membership/associated-and-overseas-territories/ [Accessed 1 August 2018].79Relating to the application of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and found in the Charter of the Commonwealth 2013, II.80Charter of the Commonwealth 2013, IV.81B.

In deciding which approach to take, it may be prudent for the JCPC to recall, should thematter come before them, that twisting the branch will incline the tree.83Separation of powersThe point made here refers to the earlier mentioned case of Lendore84 and a statement made by LordHughes JSC at [16], where His Lordship considers whether the separation of powers is relevant andpersuasive when the executive has the right to grant clemency when the courts have sentenced to death.His Lordship considered whether one branch of the state can lawfully interfere with the execution ofanother’s role. His Lordship was not satisfied by the argument in Lendore, referring to the earlier case ofBoyce v The Queen,85 in which Lord Hoffman stated that arguing a constitution was “based upon theprinciple of the separation of powers” as “pithy”. Lord Hoffman felt that constitutions create their ownversion of the separation of powers and transcribe that into domestic law—the role of the court is to thenuphold that constitutional view of the separation of powers. The difficulty here lies in a vague descriptionof the separation of powers laid down in the Constitution. In the absence of a specific model of separation,how does the judiciary and legislature establish their remit without testing the limits of their power?InGodwin and Ferguson there is currently no indication that the decisions of the Court were ultra vires;however, the author acknowledges the pending appeal of the government against the Ferguson decision.Notwithstanding, the curious approach was taken to legislate to stop the decision in Godwin applyinggoing forward, without affecting the authority of the decision between the time the judgment was handeddown and the time the DPA provisions commenced. This is distinctly different from the Lendore andBoyce examples listed above, in that the question is whether an action which is inconsistent with theseparation of powers in Bermuda is unconstitutional. The Bermuda Constitution Order 1968 mentions an“independent court” several times, and yet it is questioned whether the court is truly independent if thelegislature can legislate to confine a ruling of a court without preceding through an appeal in pursuanceof natural justice.86 Little comment was made in Ferguson about the legislature’s apparent indifferencetowards the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers, so this matter continues to beunresolved.The Supreme Court of Bermuda itself has recently stated in the case of Centre for Justice87 that theConstitution has created an “independent judiciary based on the separation of powers”.88 In Centre forJustice the claimants were seeking judicial review of, inter alia, the decision of the executive to designatesix churches as polling stations in a referendum on same-sex relationships, which were actively supportingPreserveMarriage Ltd, an organisation established to resist same-sex marriage. In addition, the Court wasasked to consider the constitutionality of calling a referendum on same-sex marriage, and the Court madecomments generally on the use of referendums to make policy on human rights matters. The Court seemsto indicate that the convention of not using referendums to drive policy reforms in areas of human rightswas not as absolute as previously considered. This raises the potential of government tabling legislation82 In terms of Judicial Activism.83A.

The Courtalso felt that it had jurisdiction to oversee the legality of a referendum, but that the Bermudian governmentwas able to convene a referendum that proposed to limit or extinguish rights that were enjoyed under theHRA. The Court also stated that “fundamental rights could not be diluted or negotiated by the electorate”.89There seems to be some disconnect between these statements. Furthermore, these statements do not seemto rest easy with the living tree analogy used earlier, or the UK and EU perspective that rights grow associety grows.90 It can, however, be married with the statement made by the European Court of Humanrights, viz the development of rights must be “in the light of present day conditions”.91 Therefore, if theopinion of the Bermudian people has changed and is now more hostile towards same-sex marriage rights,the government could argue that it is simply responding to this change. However, if the majority of areferendum are not in favour of same-sex marriage, should rights be interpreted in light of domesticBermudian communities, BritishOverseas communities, UK, Commonwealth or international communities?Each one would potentially lead to a different outcome. In June 2016 the same-sex relationships referendumwas held in Bermuda, and 69% of the votes cast were against same-sex marriage. Despite these figures,the turnout was only 46.89% of eligible voters, which is below the 50% required for the referendum resultto be valid.92 It may be hard to justify using the referendum as support for removing same-sex marriage,as it is not a valid referendum due to poor turnout. If there seems to be at best an indifference amongstthe communities of Bermuda as to same-sex marriage (given the low turnout despite campaigning by bothsides), how does this translate into the interpretation of rights in light of the community that they serve?This conundrum does demonstrate the tension between the courts, which are seeking to assert legalcertainty, and the government which may be more inclined to make policy based on the view of 14,192,93or 21.70% of Bermuda’s population.94 The weight of international jurisprudence in Bermuda will certainlybe under the spotlight if the government seeks to appeal the decision to the Bermudian Court of Appealor seeks the involvement of the JCPC. A connected issue has recently been decided in the UK SupremeCourt—equal access to civil partnerships has been debated for a number of years and this is a salient pointwhich can be discussed in brief in relation to Bermudian same-sex marriage.Equal access to civil partnershipsBrief consideration will be given here to the recent decision of the UK Supreme Court in the case ofSteinfeld and Keidan,95 and the insight that it may give the government of Bermuda should they seek torefer the matter to the JCPC. After all, the JCPC may de jure be a different chamber of adjudication, andthe relationship it has with overseas and Commonwealth territories is unique and subject to political andlegal sensitivities. However, given that the same justices decide cases in the JCPC as do in the UK’sSupreme Court it would be prudent to acknowledge the decisions of one, when it deals with a relevantsubject, even if it does not bind the other.96 On 27 June 2018 the UK Supreme Court handed down itsjudgment in the above-mentioned case of Steinfeld and Keidan, issuing a declaration of incompatibilitystating that the provisions of ss.1 and 3 of the Civil Partnership Act 2004 (CPA) were incompatible with89DeRoche v The Registrar General [2016] SC (Bda) 64 Civ at [8].90Edwards v Canada [1930] A.C. 124; 1929 UKPC 86.91 Tyrer v United Kingdom (1978) 2 E.H.R.R. 1 at [31].92 S.

This is because the CPA onlypermitted same-sex couples to form civil partnerships and not different-sex couples. It is noteworthy thatthis decision has come about following the UK’s creation of same-sex marriage, and one might ask whatcould have been the logical reason for allowing same-sex couples to form civil partnerships, civil marriagesand religious marriages while not allowing different-sex couples the same rights. This has been discussedat length by authors such as Gaffney-Rhys, who argues that the CPA should be extended to heterosexualcouples on the grounds of equality, privacy, dignity and autonomy and argues that denying mixed-sexcouples the right to form a civil partnership contravenes arts 8 and 14 of the ECHR.97 This is the samelogical reasoning that the judiciary has adopted in the case of Steinfeld and Keidan and this leads to twopoints—first what impact would this have should the Bermudian DPA and decision in Ferguson bechallenged before the JCPC, and secondly what does this say about the notion of equality that is adoptedby the UK Supreme Court? This latter point will be addressed under the next heading.In reference to the impact of this decision on any potential referral to the JCPC by the Bermudiangovernment, it should not fill the Bermudian government with much confidence if it continues with thearguments used in Ferguson. One difference here is that the DPA does extend to same-sex and opposite-sexcouples and so the question is not analogous, rather the logic in the decision of the UK Supreme Court iskey. If the CPA is incompatible with art.14 taken with art.8 because it discriminates against different-sexcouples, then the Bermudian Marriage Act 1944 would also be incompatible with art.14 and art.8 if itdoes not permit same-sex couples to marry; this of course is similar to the decision in Godwin.98 Thesecond matter needs a greater look at the meaning of equality and its role in legal theory on the Rule ofLaw.Equality before the lawExigencies of space preclude a full consideration of the historical development of, and the later codificationof, equality before the law in constitutional terms. However, some key and salient points can be made inthe short space allowed to explore the nuances of same-sex marriage in Bermuda and the approach toequality taken by the court in Steinfeld and Keidan. The Diceyan concept of the Rule of Law includesreference to the law applying equally to all, but makes no judgment on the quality or content of the lawitself.99 This is often termed the “equal subjection of all classes to a common rule”.100 At the opposite endof the spectrum lies the substantive approach, which often cites that the Rule of Law draws its authorityfrom notions of equality, liberty and fundamental freedoms.101 This distinction is necessary beforeconsidering equality before the law clause in Bermuda. Each person will have a favoured perspective onwhether equality as a term simply denotes the “equal subjugation”, or whether it goes further in referringto a common set of fundamental rights everyone can enjoy. Depending on a person’s semantic preference,a formalist would say that the law can be legitimately discriminatory,102 whilst a substantivist would saythat the authority of law is reliant on the content of law being compatible with a normative set of rights.Applying this to same-sex marriage in Bermuda, the very beginning of the Bermudian Constitution statesthat “every person is entitled to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual”.103 This statement97R.

This poses aquestion: if the Constitution sets out certain rights and characteristics which are protected, is ejusdemgeneris104 permitted to expand the list in the constitution? Ferguson would seem to imply that the list isnot finite and that the HRA, along with the common law, can expand on the specific rights andcharacteristics protected in the Constitution. Here, one criticism of the substantive conception rings true,viz against who’s moral or ethical standard is the list of rights benchmarked? It has already been statedin this article that the collective opinion of the people is not a sufficient benchmark against which to setfundamental rights. Doing so will marginalise minority groups, which are arguably in greater need ofprotection from discrimination. It is therefore the responsibility of a few people in positions ofauthority—such as legislatures and the judiciary—to decide which characteristics are protected fromdiscrimination and how wide universal rights extend. The issue that arises when a small number of peopledecide such an important factor is that severe change can occur when a post-holder changes to one witha different moral compass or conception on the rule of law. A judge with a purely formal conception onthe rule of law might hold that even oppressive laws are neither arbitrary nor contrary to equality.105 Thisleads on to a discussion documented by Fairgrieve106 and is beyond the scope of this article. In brief,however, when one considers the role of equality before the law as an argument to expand discriminationprotections, it is right to ask to what extent should they be expanded upon and to reflect on the opinionsof those imbued with the power to adjudicate on such matters. It would have been difficult for the Courtto assert that discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation was prohibited by the HRA, and thatsame-sex marriage discrimination was not prohibited, on the basis that one begets the other. The Court’sview in Ferguson, that the Constitution protects every individual’s right to hold a belief is perfectlyacceptable,107 and the use of that logic to dismiss the proposition that the constitutional right to believeonly in opposite-sex marriage precludes same-sex marriage is utilitarian. It does address equality beforethe law in a roundabout way, in that it asserts a view that everyone has the right to a belief save in theinstance that it impacts on others. How far that impact is measured, and what substantive view on equalitybefore the law is being adopted to reach that conclusion, are questions that cannot yet be answered pendingeither an appeal or further case-law from Bermuda.In terms of the UK Supreme Courts demonstrable view, however, Steinfeld and Keidan seems to bedrawing on both the substantive conception of equality having a relation to the fairness of the law to all.This draws on three of Lord Bingham’s key principles in his theory on the Rule of Law. First, that thelaw applies equally to all, this in itself is formalist as it passes no comment on the content of law and solaws could be discriminatory.108 Secondly, however, that the courts must protect fundamental human rights,and thirdly, that the courts must act fairly when deciding cases. The courts have already demonstrated,not least in Steinfeld and Keidan, that forming a legal relationship is a matter which is relevant to the rightto a private and family life protected under art.8. It has also demonstrated that treating people differentlyon the basis of their sexual orientation is discriminatory and contrary to both art.8 and art.14. Couplingthis together, the UK Supreme Court seems to have decided matters relatively consistently with theBermudian Supreme Court, even if the reasoning behind the eventual decision was different. The courtsare clearly utilising that distinctly substantive idea of fairness when looking at who should be entitled tomarry and form civil partnerships and adopting a broad understanding of equality.

Notwithstanding this point, legislating on equality andenshrining in legislation a form of discrimination seems, prima facie, contrary to the ethos of the BermudianConstitution and its HRA. Permitting an Act to treat people less favourably as a result of their sexualityis intrinsically discriminatory. Sexual orientation and same-sex marriage are fundamentally linked by theirdefinition.109 Therefore, to argue that discrimination should be sanctioned against same-sex couples wantingto marry and not sanctioned against a person’s sexual orientation is illogical, as same-sex marriage is bydefinition reliant on those parties of the same sex wishing to marry. It is concluded that there is a strongargument for declaring that same-sex marriage should persist in Bermuda by drawing the inference thatthe DPA is inconsistent with the objectives of the Bermudian HRA insofar as it aims to treat same-sexcouples less favourably than opposite-sex couples. A further argument is that the HRA’s quasi-constitutionalstatus gives rights which cannot easily be taken away by ordinary law in support of both the living treedoctrine and the statement mentioned above in Blackburn.What will be the approach taken by the Bermudian Court of Appeal should it grant permission to appeal,considering tensions between the opinions of a proportion of their residents and the UK’s approach? TheUK supports same-sex marriage, the European Court of Human Rights has considered same-sex marriageextensively,110 and whether either of these would trickle into the judgment of the Bermudian Court ofAppeal is a matter to be seen. It is not limited to impact from the UK and European jurisprudence, thecase of Jones111 (the very recent case in Trinidad and Tobago) saw the Court declare that criminalisingsame-sex sexual activity was unconstitutional. Although Trinidad and Tobago may not yet be at the pointof discussing same-sex marriage, it is nonetheless a positive move in terms of LGBT+ rights in theCaribbean.If the Bermudian Court of Appeal grants permission to appeal then the role of the JCPC may be ofinterest, and the latter arguments in this article may warrant further discussion. Would the JCPC applythe living tree doctrine, which will advance Bermudian rights and, if so, howmuch will UK and Strasbourgjurisprudence influence the JCPC? If the JCPC did decide to assert rights as it has done more recently inthe case of Steinfeld and Keidan, can it be of assistance with harmonising the inconsistencies more widelyseen across the Commonwealth? There are approximately112 36 Commonwealth countries which criminalisehomosexuality or the LGBT+ community in some way, and the JCPC could be a source of authority toencourage equality and tolerance across the Commonwealth.

The court’s decisions are handed down in pursuance of upholding the constitutionas the supreme law, and (using the living tree doctrine) expanding the rights contained in the constitutionto reflect society as a whole. In doing so the court should consider the impact and shortcomings of majorityrule and identity thinking; the opinions of the population of Bermuda are anecdotally relevant but shouldnot be used as authority for a contraction of rights or the living tree. Minority groups inevitably form asmaller share of the population and so their voices can be drowned out by the masses.

In a decision, which may transform freemovement for same-sex couples across the Union,2 the ECJ concluded that non-EU citizens, whether theyare travelling with their EU spouse to another Member State or returning to the spouse’s home jurisdiction,can derive a right of residence for more than three months.Facts3The case centred on Adrian Coman, a Romanian national, and Claibourn Hamilton, an American citizen,who married in Belgium in 2010.4 The couple had previously lived together for a number of years in theUnited States, although they did not cohabit in Brussels where Mr Coman was working at the EuropeanParliament. Subsequently, in 2013, the couple considered relocating to Romania. They requested informationabout the conditions under which Mr Hamilton would be able to reside in that jurisdiction for more thanthree months. The Romanian authorities responded that no such entitlement existed because domestic lawdid not acknowledge the couple’s Belgian same-sex marriage. Mr Hamilton could not, therefore, obtainresidence rights through family reunification.The couple challenged this refusal before the national courts, arguing that the failure to recognise, inthe context of residence, their Belgian marriage contravened various provisions of the Romanianconstitution. When the case transferred to the Constitutional Court (which was called upon to adjudicatethe constitutional complaint) that court stayed proceedings and issued a number of questions to the EuropeanCourt of Justice (“ECJ”).5 In particular, the Constitutional Court asked whether: (a) the term “spouse” inart.2(2)(a) of Directive 2004/38, read in the light of arts 7, 9, 21 and 45 of the Charter of FundamentalRights of the European Union (“EU Charter”), includes a non-EU same-sex spouse who an EU citizen*University of Bristol.1Relu Adrian Coman, Robert Clabourn Hamilton, Asociatia Accept v Inspectoratul General pentru Imigrari, Ministerul Afacerilor Interne (C-673/16),5 June 2018 (“Coman”)2See: Nika Bacic Selanec and Chloe Bell, “Who is a ‘spouse’ under the Citizens’ Rights Directive?

Therefore, as Mr Hamilton was seeking to derive extended residenceentitlements in Romania—an EU jurisdiction of which his spouse is a citizen—the Citizenship Directivewas not strictly applicable.6However, the Court also observed that in prior jurisprudence it had confirmed that non-EU citizens,such as Mr Hamilton, who do not enjoy residence benefits under Directive 2004/38 because their familymember is a national of the EU jurisdiction in which they intend to live can derive such benefits fromart.21(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”).7 Preventing EU citizens,such asMr Coman, from continuing family life in their home country, which those citizens has commencedand developed while genuinely resident in another Member State is likely to discourage individuals fromleaving their home jurisdiction and exercising freedom ofmovement.8 In determining the conditions underwhich an EU citizen’s family can obtain residence rights in the home member state national authoritiescannot impose requirements which are “stricter than those laid down by Directive 2004/38.”9The question that arose in Coman was whether Mr Hamilton—a non-EU same-sex spouse who hadmarried an EU citizen in a Member State in which that citizen was genuinely resident—qualified as a“family” member with whom Mr Coman, having exercised his freedom of movement in Belgium, had aright to maintain family life when he returned to Romania. To this question, the Grand Chamber answeredin the affirmative.Applying Directive 2004/38 by analogy, the Luxembourg judges acknowledged that under art.2(2)(a)family members specifically include an EU citizen’s spouse. The term “spouse” used in that provisionrefers to a person joined to another person by the bonds of marriage. It is a gender-neutral concept (notrequiring that a marital union be heterosexual) and is capable of embracing individuals in a same-sexmarriage.10While art.2(2)(b) of the Citizenship Directive (which, as discussed below, creates residence rights forsame-sex registered partners) only applies where the host Member State also validates same-sex civilpartnerships, art.2(2)(a) confers rights upon non-EU spouses without reference to internal legal recognition.11As such, jurisdictions, including Romania, cannot rely upon their national framework to withhold residenceentitlements (guaranteed by EU law) from an individual inMr Hamilton’s position.12 To conclude otherwisewould create a situation whereby: (a) the rights of EU citizens, who have already exercised freedom ofmovement and who want to maintain family ties created during that movement, would fluctuate accordingto national law; and (b) the provisions of Directive 2004/38, applicable by analogy, would be deprived oftheir effectiveness.13Withholding spousal residence entitlements fromMrHamilton—whomMrComan had lawfully marriedwhile genuinely resident in Belgium—interfered with the latter’s freedom of movement. It could only bepermissible if it was “based on objective public-interest considerations” and was “proportionate to a6Coman (C-673/16) at [18]–[21].7Coman (C-673/16) at [22]–[23].8Coman (C-673/16) at [24].9Coman (C-673/16) at [25].10Coman (C-673/16) at [34]–[35].11Coman (C-673/16) at [36].12Coman (C-673/16) at [36].13Coman (C-673/16) at [39].384 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorslegitimate objective pursued by national law.”14 In their observations to the Court, a number of governmentssuggested that refusing spousal residence entitlements to same-sex couples met this threshold because itwas necessary to maintain the fundamental, opposite-gender nature of marriage.15 However, the GrandChamber—having confirmed that derogations from fundamental rights must be interpretedstrictly16—rejected the proposition that withholding residence benefits from persons, such asMr Hamilton,was justified by public policy.Extending the definition of “spouse” to same-sex couples would not require Member States to amendtheir general definition of marriage.17 The ECJ had affirmed on numerous previous occasions that thereis no rule of EU law which requires Member States to permit same-sex marriage. Bringing Mr Hamiltonwithin the definition of spouse under directive 2004/38 would result in Romania, for the limited purposesof EU residence rules, acknowledging the validity of a marriage lawfully concluded in Belgium. However,it would place no further obligation upon the Romanian state to embrace Mr Coman and Mr Hamilton asspouses under domestic law (e.g. favourable tax calculations, next-of-kin rights, etc.).18 As such, the partialrecognition on offer would not “undermine the national identity or pose a threat to the public policy ofthe Member State concerned.”19The ECJ also stressed that, in order to be permissible, a derogation from freedom of movement mustbe consistent with fundamental rights as protected under the EU Charter.20 However, in this case, byrefusing to allow Mr Coman to maintain his shared marital life with Mr Hamilton, Romania was actingin a manner which breached the right to family life both as set out in art.7 of the EU Charter and asinterpreted in recent case law of the European Court of Human Rights.21The Grand Chamber concluded that, as the non-EU same-sex spouse of a Romanian citizen who hadentered a marriage while genuinely resident in Belgium, Mr Hamilton was entitled to reside with MrComan in Romania for longer than three months. The conditions which Mr Coman and Mr Hamiltonwould have to satisfy in order to exercise that derived residence right could not be any stricter than theresidence conditions imposed under Directive 2004/38.CommentThe decision of the Grand Chamber in Coman is a welcome affirmation of sexual orientation rights andis likely to have a significant practical impact for gay, lesbian and bisexual persons who (with their non-EUspouse) either move or return to Member States which currently lack same-sex relationship frameworks.22Reinforcing existing same-sex free movement rightsThe judgment creates a robust structure through which same-sex married couples (where one spouse lacksEU citizenship), who move throughout the 28Member States, can be confident of maintaining their familylife. The Grand Chamber’s reasoning builds upon, and extends, the existing residence protections whichsame-sex couples already enjoy under the Citizenship Directive. As noted a novel feature of that legislationapplied by analogy in Coman is the inclusion—within the concept of family members who enjoy derivedrights of residence for more than three months—of “partner[s] with whom the Union citizen has contracted14Coman (C-673/16) at [41].15Coman (C-673/16) at [42].16Coman (C-673/16) at [44].17Coman (C-673/16) at [45].18Coman (C-673/16) at [45].19Coman (C-673/16) at [46].20Coman (C-673/16) at [47].21Coman (C-673/16) at [48]–[50].22Alina Tryfonidou, “EU free movement law and the legal recognition of same-sex relationships: the case for mutual recognition” (2015) 21(1)Columbia Journal of European Law 195.Case Analysis 385[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsa registered partnership” [art.2(2)(b)]. When first introduced, art.2(2)(b) constituted in many respects aradical development for EU law conferring residence guarantees upon a class of relationships which, in2004, a majority of the current Member States did not even acknowledge.Yet, the scope of this new “registered partnership” category is limited by the fact that host MemberStates only incur an obligation to extend residence benefits where domestic law also provides for same-sexpartnership. Thus, while jurisdictions such as Greece and Italy, which recently introduced LGB partnershipframeworks23, are required to grant residence beyond three months to non-EU same-sex partners no suchobligation would arise in countries, such as Latvia and Romania, which continue to permit only opposite-sexmarriage.24Article 2(2)(b) of the Citizenship Directive mirrors the ECJ’s case law regarding relationship-basedemployment benefits arising from the Qualification Directive. While decisions such asMaruko25, Romer26and Hay27 confirm that Member States cannot discriminate against same-sex registered partners who arecomparably-situated to opposite-sex spouses, the Court’s reasoning requires the existence of some baselinelegislation.28Reticent EU jurisdictions can avoid adverse judgments simply by withholding any relationshiprecognition. In a similar vein, under art.2(2)(b), Member States who oppose residence entitlements forsame-sex partners can avoid EU law obligations by refusing to create any partnership structure withintheir domestic law.The judgment in Coman, however, circumvents member state inaction by confirming that where an EUcitizen enters into a same-sex marriage with a non-EU individual host Member States must acknowledgethe same-sex spouse as “family” for the purposes of residence entitlements, irrespective of whether domesticlaw prohibits (even constitutionally) the formal recognition of LGB relationships.29 The same is also true(as Coman illustrates) when EU citizens return to home jurisdictions having married a non-EU citizen ofthe same sex while genuinely resident in another EU country. In both cases—while it need not embracesame-sex marriage generally—the Member State must recognise the validity of the foreign marriage forthe purposes of EU residence entitlements.Building upon ECHR JurisprudenceA particularly welcome aspect of Coman is the extent to which the ECJ builds upon existing EuropeanCourt of Human Rights jurisprudence: (a) acknowledging the residence entitlements of same-sex couples;and (b) challenging speculative public policy arguments raised in opposition to sexual orientation rights.In recent years, the European Court of Human Rights has applied increasingly robust review whereContracting Parties exclude same-sex couples from family reunification.30 In Pajic v Croatia,31 a Bosnianindividual had no right to join her female Croatian partner even though if the couple had different sexesresidence benefits would have been available. Observing the unjustified difference of treatment betweenheterosexual and LGB unmarried couples the Strasbourg judges found a violation of art.14 of the EuropeanConvention of Human Rights (“ECHR”) read in conjunction with art.8 ECHR.

Although Taddeucciand McCall were treated similarly to unmarried heterosexual couples, the European Court of HumanRights held that such treatment was inappropriate because same-sex couples could not formalise theirrelationship and Italian law took no account of Mr McCall’s individual circumstances.The decision inComan—although obviously grounded in the specific frameworks of Directive 2004/38and art. 21(1) TFEU—builds upon the reasoning and sentiments expressed in the Strasbourg case law,particularly the rejection of internal legal structures as sufficient to exclude same-sex family reunification.While neither the ECJ nor the European Court of Human Rights have (yet) imposed general marriageequality obligations,33 both courts exhibit a growing willingness to protect same-sex family life acrossEuropean borders.The Coman decision also mirrors recent European Court of Human Rights scepticism regarding thepublic policy arguments which Contracting Parties raise against lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans rights.As noted inComan a number ofMember States had cited the fundamental, opposite-sex nature of marriageas supporting a limited definition of “spouse” under art.2(2)(a) of the Citizenship Directive. However, theGrand Chamber pointed out that where expanding the definition of spouse to embrace Mr Hamilton andMr Coman has no appreciable impact on national definitions of marriage the preservation of thosedefinitions could not justify restricting Mr Coman’s freedom of movement.34Such readiness to substantively interrogate member state policy rationales is also evident in EuropeanCourt of Human Rights jurisprudence.While, inKarner v Austria,35 the Austrian government had suggestedthat withholding survivor tenancy rights from same-sex couples was necessary to protect the traditionalinstitution of marriage the Court could identify no way in which an individual acceding to his or herdeceased same-sex partner’s tenancy would undermine heterosexual marriage.36 Similarly, in Vallianatosv Greece37 the Court noted that, while Greece had defended the exclusively heterosexual character of civilpartnership laws as necessary to protect children and marriage, access to such partnerships was open todifferent-sex couples irrespective of their parental status.38Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European UnionOne notable aspect of the Grand Chamber’s judgment—which has drawn critique39—is the absence(whether intentionally or otherwise) of fundamental rights analysis. In its reasoning the Court clearlylocates the present dispute within freedom of movement principles and derives Mr Hamilton’s extendedresidence entitlements fromMr Coman’s rights under art.21(1) TFEU.While the Romanian ConstitutionalCourt requested an interpretation of art.2(2)(a) of the Citizenship Directive, read in the light of arts 7, 9,21 and 45 of the EU Charter, the Grand Chamber restricts itself to acknowledging that Romania’sinterference with Mr Coman’s freedom of movement was incompatible with guarantees of “family life”(art.7 of the EU Charter).On the one hand, the ECJ’s concentration on freedom of movement is strategically appealing. Eventhough Coman does not impose broader same-sex marriage obligations the litigation still touches upon32 Taddeucci and McCall v Italy (App. No.51362/09), judgment of 30 June 2016.33Coman (C-673/16) at [37]; Schalk and Kopf v Austria (App. No.30141/04), judgment of 24 June 2010.34Coman (C-673/16) at [45]–[46].35Karner v Austria (App. No.40016/98), judgment of 24 October 2003 (“Karner”).36Karner (App. No.40016/98) at [41]–[42].37Vallianatos v Greece (App. Nos 29381/09 and 32684/09), judgment of 7 November 2013 (“Vallianatos”).38Vallianatos (App. Nos 29381/09 and 32684/09) at [82]–[88].39Michael Rhimes, “The “gay marriage” case that never was: Three thoughts on Coman, Part 2” (6 June 2018), UK Human Rights Blog,https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2018/06/06/the-gay-marriage-case-that-never-was-three-thoughts-on-coman-part-2-michael-rhimes/ [Accessed 1 August2018]; Daron Ran, “Adrian Coman v.

Grounding its judgmentin art.21(1) TFEU rather than the EU Charter, the Grand Chamber was still able to vindicate Mr ComanandMr Hamilton’s EU entitlements, but did not have to raise more controversial (and contested) questionsof sexual orientation equality (art.21 of the EU Charter).40 In addition while AG Wathelet did, in hisopinion, more substantively address fundamental rights it is not clear that his conclusions on the topic aremore convincing (or add to) the ECJ’s brief discussion of art.7.41On the other hand, there is also a compelling argument that—at least symbolically—theGrand Chamber’srefusal to engage with fundamental rights constitutes a missed opportunity. The idea that “spouse” underart.2(2)(a) of Directive 2004/38 excludes lawfully married couples simply because they are gay or lesbianhas obvious implications for sexual orientation non-discrimination. The fact that the Court failed to tacklethose implications may serve to increase perceptions, encouraged by recent judgments such as Leger,42that the ECJ is not yet willing to meaningfully apply fundamental rights to Europe’s LGBT populations.43Future QuestionsMoving forward, the Grand Chamber’s judgment in Coman invites us to consider three, indirectly-relatedissues.First, for observers in the United Kingdom Coman is a timely illustration of the important role whichEU law, and particularly the ECJ, has historically played in advancing LGBT rights across the memberstates. As the United Kingdom prepares to leave the Union the Grand Chamber’s judgment serves toremind UK LGBT populations that they will no longer benefit from future (possible transformative)innovations in this sphere.44This future reality was brought into sharp relief just four weeks after the Coman judgment when, inMB, the ECJ held that the United Kingdom’s refusal before the Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Act 2013to permit married trans individuals to access retirement pension benefits according to their preferred gender(there was a requirement to annul an existingmarriage) constituted unlawful sex discrimination.45 Post-Brexitand the removal of the jurisdiction of the Luxembourg Court LGBT persons in the UK will becomedetached from a key institutional ally in the development and enforcement of their rights. While the recentcase of R. (on the application of Steinfeld) v Secretary of State for International Development46—wherethe UK Supreme Court condemned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in accessing civilpartnership—offers some consolation that LGBT populations will still enjoy the protection of the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights, one must remember that, in Hamalainen v Finland,47 the European Court ofHuman Rights actually upheld the validity of divorce as a pre-condition for legal gender recognition.Second, what influence will the decision have upon advancing movements for marriage equality acrossthe European Union? While the ECJ is clear that expanding the definition of “spouse” in art.2(2)(a) ofthe Citizenship Directive leaves intact Member State competence to determine the national definition ofmarriage some commentators have suggested that it would be “anomalous” for a jurisdiction, such asRomania, to allow non-EU same-sex partners to reside in their territory on the basis of a marriage which40Michael Rhimes, “The “gay marriage” case that never was: Three thoughts on Coman, Part 2” (6 June 2018) UK Human Rights Blog,https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2018/06/06/the-gay-marriage-case-that-never-was-three-thoughts-on-coman-part-2-michael-rhimes/ [Accessed 1 August2018].41Coman (C-673/16) (Opinion of AG Wathelet) at [59]–[67].42 Leger (C-528/13), 29 April 2015.43Alina Tryfonidou, “The Leger ruling as another example of the ECJ’s disappointingly reticent approach to the protection of the rights of LGBpersons under EU law” (2016) 41(1) European Law Review 91; Uladzislau Belavusau, “Towards EU sexual risk regulation: restrictions on blooddonation as infringement of active citizenship” (2016) 7(4) European Journal of Risk Regulation 801.44 For a full discussion of the potential impact of Brexit on LGBTQI rights in the United Kingdom, see: Jonathan Cooper OBE, Peter Dunne, AnyaPalmer and Keina Yoshida, Brexit, The LGBT Impact Assessment (Gay Star News, 2018).45MB (C-451/16), 26 June 2018.46R.

Of course, as the judgment imposes marital recognitionobligations upon EU jurisdictions, national authorities may not consider it so anomalous to limit the impactof Coman. However, at a time when the European Court of Human Rights continues to disavow same-sexmarriage rights under arts 8, 12 and 14 ECHR there is undeniable significance in the Grand Chamberembracing same-sex couples within the Citizenship Directive definition of “spouse”.49Finally, how should one view Coman in light of recent, high-profile cases on the provision of services?InMasterpiece Bakeshop Ltd v ColoradoHuman Rights Commission50 and Lee v Ashers Bakers Company,51both the United States and United Kingdom Supreme Courts have been asked to consider the legitimacyof withholding publicly-available services on the basis of a religious objection to same-sex marriage. Theapplicability of EU law to scenarios such asMasterpiece and Asher is limited because Directive 2000/78does not extend to services and public accommodations. Directive 2000/78 is currently the only EU-widelegislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and the EU Charter would alsonot apply.52 However, what these cases do caution is that even if Coman were to encourage more generalsame-sex marriage entitlements across the 28 Member States, accessing marriage may not guarantee thatsame-sex couples enjoy all marriage-related benefits on an equality footing with their different-sex peers.48Alina Tryfonidou, “Free Movement of Same-Sex Spouses within the EU: The ECJ’s Coman Judgment” (19 June 2018) European Law Blog,https://europeanlawblog.eu/2018/06/19/free-movement-of-same-sex-spouses-within-the-eu-the-ecjs-coman-judgment/ [Accessed 1 August 2018).49Paul Johnson, “‘The choice of wording must be regarded as deliberate’: same-sex marriage and Article 12 of the European Convention on HumanRights” (2015) 40(2) European Law Review 207.50Masterpiece Bakeshop Ltd v Colorado Human Rights Commission 584 U.S. (2018).51 Lee v Ashers Bakers Company [2016] NICA 55.52 Jürgen Römer v Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg (C-147/08), 10 May 2011.Case Analysis 389[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCase and CommentSelected decisions from the European Court of Human Rights for Marchand April 2018Editor: Dr Sofia Galani, Lecturer in Law, Human Rights Implementation Centre, University of BristolLaw School.Contributors: Richard Costidell, Christopher Gray, Kaj Hadad, Lucie Laffont, AnthonyMorelli, JordanOwen, Alice Venn, Jennyfer Vervisch (University of Bristol).Note on Court judgments: European Court judgments can be delivered by a Grand Chamber of 17judges, a chamber of seven judges from one of the Court’s five sections or, where the issue is already thesubject of well-established case-law, by a committee of three judges from one of the sections.

The original judgment concerned a claim by the Irish Government against the UK, arguing thatthe latter breached art.3 of the Convention by torturing suspected members of the Irish Republican Army(IRA). Owing to a sustained campaign of bombings, both in England and Northern Ireland, the UKinstituted a series of emergency powers which granted the authorities extra-judicial powers of arrest,detainment, internment and interrogation with the so-called “five techniques”—wall-standing, hooding,subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and water. The Court took the view inthe original judgment that these techniques were not capable of causing a level of suffering which wouldallow them to be classed as acts of torture.[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors390The first ground of revision concerned the criterion of severity for torture. The Irish Governmentcontended that a newly available medical report produced by Dr L, which the UK Government had in itspossession at the time of the original judgment, demonstrated that the effects of the “five techniques”could be “substantial, severe and long-lasting”. Despite this report, Dr L gave evidence in the proceedingsrelating to the original judgment, submitting that the effects of the “five techniques” were minor and shortterm. The applicant Government contended that if the Court had been made aware of the true gravity ofthe “five techniques” in the original judgment, it would have or could have found them to constitute actsof torture.A second ground of revision advanced by the Irish Government was that the newly available materialrevealed the extent to which the UKGovernment had actively adopted a policy of withholding informationfrom the Commission and the Court in the original judgment, including that the use of the “five techniques”had been authorised at a ministerial level. The Irish Government submitted that if the Court in the originaljudgment had been aware of this they would have scrutinised the evidence presented by the UKGovernmentmore carefully, possibly arriving at a different outcome. The Irish Government also argued that the failureto co-operate with the Court in the original judgment was, on its own, a ground of revision.Held(1) The request for revision was dismissed (six votes to one).The Court first dealt with the UK’s submission that Ireland had not been with the six-monthtime limit as Ireland had received a number of documents, including the medical report byDr L, and had become aware of research into the newly released documents as early as 2013.The Court noted that the majority of the case-law relied upon by both parties in this regarddealt with whether the fact upon which revision was requested could have been known tothe parties before the delivery of the original judgment and not whether, as in the presentcase, the fact could only become known long after the original judgment was handed down.Despite this the Court found that there were good reasons to allow Rule 80(1) to apply tosituation where the new fact becomes known after the original judgment is handed down.In dealing with whether the Irish Government was within the six-month time limit the Courtfound that the request for revision was not dependent upon the receipt of one particular pieceof evidence but rather a significant number of documents which, when taken as a whole,led the Irish Government to believe there were grounds for revision. In light of this, theCourt found the Irish Government to be within the six-month time limit as it was only uponreceiving knowledge of the vast array of documents on 4 June 2014 that the Irish Governmentcould be said to have acquired the knowledge required to request a revision. Crucial to theCourt’s reasoning in this regard was that the Irish Government had not been idle when itreceived Dr L’s report in March 2014 and had submitted it to the Irish Attorney General forreview, subsequently concluding that the document on its own was not sufficient to requesta review.The Court then turned to whether the newly discovered fact may have had a decisive influenceupon the original judgment. In order to address this issue, the Court first dealt with whetherthe newly released evidence provided any new facts at all. In doing so, the Court outlinedthe procedure for determining whether the newly released documents could be said to containnew facts. First, the new documents would have to show sufficient prima facie evidencethat the Irish Government’s version of events were correct. In dealing with this the Courtnoted that the documents submitted in support of the first ground of revision concernedmatters of compensation relating to the domestic proceedings brought before the UK Courtsand only one contained the express medical opinion of Dr L, which was itself publishedCase and Comment 391[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsafter the Commission in the original judgment had heard evidence. Another document, whichcomprised of advice from a counsel to the UK Government, referenced Dr L’s medicalopinions and notably recorded that Dr L had observed long-term health effects in one of themen who was subjected to the “five techniques”. However, none of these opinions relatedto the illustrative cases brought before the Commission in the original judgment. The aboveconsiderations led the Court to express doubts as to whether the newly released documentsprovided sufficient prima facie evidence that Dr L misled the Commission in the originalproceedings.Assuming that the newly released documents did provide sufficient prima facie evidencethat Dr L did mislead the Commission in the original proceedings, the Court opined that itcould not be said that knowledge of the newly released documents would have altered thefindings of the original judgment. The Court reached this view on the understanding thatDr Lwas not the only professional to suggest the “five techniques” resulted in only short-termconsequences. Also, the Court gave great weight to the fact that the Court in the originalproceedings did not consider the issue of possible long-term effects when ascribing the “fivetechniques” with the status of inhuman and degrading treatment but rather the fact that the“five techniques” lacked the required severity to be considered as torture. The Court notedthat the perceived severity of the “five techniques” does not depend on whether theconsequences of their usage are long term or short term.In dealing with the second ground of revision, namely that the UKGovernment had activelymisled the Commission, the Court went on to examine the facts which the newly releaseddocuments provided. In doing so, the Court found that the documents provided no factswhich were not known the Commission at the time of the original proceedings. The Courtcommented that while they shed light upon the UKGovernment’s general attitude of delayingthe original proceedings and that, as part of its general litigation strategy, it had concededthat the “five techniques” constituted torture in the original proceedings so as to preventtheir witnesses from being cross-examined on the point, the documents did not provide anyfacts not already known. Indeed, the Commission in the original proceedings commentedon the UK Government’s habit of delaying proceedings and that the UK Government hadexpressly announced at the start of the original proceedings that it had instructed all witnessesnot to answer any questions in relation to the “five techniques”.Cases consideredBugajny and Others v Poland, (revision) (App. No.22531/05), judgment of 15 December 2009Cernescu andManolache v Romania (revision) (App. No.28607/04), judgment of 30 November 2010Gafgen v Germany Gäfgen v Germany (2010) 52 E.H.R.R. 1Grossi and Others v Italy (revision) (App. No.18791/03), judgment of 30 October 2012Hertzog and Others v Romania (revision) (App. No.34011/02), judgment of 14 April 2009Ireland v the United Kingdom (1978) 2 E.H.H.R 25McGinley and Egan (revision) (App. No.23414/94), judgment of 28 January 2000Naumoski v the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (revision) (App. No.25248/05), judgmentof 5 December 2013Selmouni v France (2000) 29 E.H.H.R 403392 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCommentThe present case is helpful in that it clarifies the procedure for revising previous judgments and providesthat evidence which could not have been known at the time of the original judgment can still be reliedupon to make an application for revision. The case also clarified that the Court will not retrospectivelyre-interpret the facts which were known at the time of the original judgment but rather will solely relyupon how the new facts may have been interpreted had they been known. Also, of interest is the tacticrecognition by the Court that the “five techniques” need not be explicitly recognised as torturous practices,as suggested by the Government of Ireland, owing to the more recent case of Selmouni v France in whichreliance upon the original judgment was prevented owing to the ever-evolving classification of torture.This is significant as it is arguable that in formulating its judgment in this way the Court missed anopportunity to finally end suggestions that measures similar to the “five techniques” should not be classifiedas torture owing to a selective reading of the Court’s jurisprudence and the reasoning of the originaljudgment.Judge O’Leary’s dissenting opinion also merits consideration. Although Judge O’Leary disagreed withthe majority on many points the most notable is her suggestion that the majority adopted an unnecessarilynarrow view of how the Court reached its decision in the original judgment. Primarily Judge O’Learyopined that the majority were wrong to view the revision request as though it were seeking to change thelegal definition of torture, or the stigma attached to it, as it existed in 1978. Rather, in Judge O’Leary’sview, the revision request was seeking to establish how the Court would have applied that same definitionin 1978, had it been in possession of all of the facts which were withheld from it at the time. In this sense,it was opined that had the original Court had access to the now available documents, it would have been“very difficult, if not impossible, to displace” the Commission’s unanimous finding of torture in theoriginal proceedings. A final point of interest to note from the dissenting opinion is her suggestion thatthe reason the original Court found that the “five techniques” did not constitute acts of torture may havebeen because the Court was unwilling to find the UK, a founding state of the European Convention,responsible for a violation of art.3 owing to the special stigma that it recognised was attached to suchviolations.Although the outcome might be particularly disappointing for the victims, the decision of the Court isnot surprising. It is difficult to contest that had the Court examined the ‘five techniques’ today and in lightof its evolving case-law and interrogation techniques, it would have concluded that they amounted totorture. It is also not difficult to accept that had the judges accepted to revise a case that was decided 40years ago in light of limited new evidence, the Court would have been unrealistic. However, as the requestfor the referral of the current judgment to the Grand Chamber is still pending, it is worth waiting to seehow both Ireland and the Grand Chamber shall react to another opportunity to review the case.The right to defend oneself in person in criminal proceedingsSelf-representation—criminal proceedings—Human Rights Committee—right to a fair trial—art.6International law; Litigants in person; Margin of appreciation; Portugal; Right to conduct own defence;Right to fair trialCorreia de Matos v Portugal (Application No.56402/12)European Court of Human Rights (Grand Chamber): Judgment of 4 April 2018Case and Comment 393[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsFactsThe applicant, Mr Carlos Correia deMatos, was previously a lawyer, but was suspended by the Bar Councilin 1993 due to his concurrent practice as an auditor. Although the applicant was no longer practising asan auditor from 2016, he remained suspended from the Bar due to a disciplinary sanction imposed forpractising as a lawyer while not authorised.The applicant was charged with the criminal offence of insulting a judge arising from civil proceedingsin 2008 in which the applicant had been acting as a lawyer. As part of the criminal investigation, a defencecounsel was appointed, but the applicant made a request that the criminal proceedings weremade adversarialand sought leave to replace the appointed defence counsel and represent himself. The Court agreed toopen the investigation to an adversarial proceeding but held that the applicant could not represent himselfwithout the assistance of defence counsel, as this would prevent the realisation of his constitutional rightto be represented by independent counsel.The Portuguese Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal, on the basis that criminal procedurerules required the separate status of the defendant and their counsel, arguing that this reflected the emotionalburden on the defendant, and was to safeguard the proper and effective defence of the accused. Theapplicant then appealed to the Constitutional Court, but they refused to examine it without the endorsementof the applicant’s state-appointed defence counsel. The criminal proceedings continued, concluding witha fine and an order for costs, including for counsel as the applicant had not requested legal aid. The costorder was discontinued as the applicant was unable to pay and lacked seizable assets. A further appealwas sought by the applicant for the criminal conviction but was found inadmissible as the applicant soughtto self-represent with the Court of Appeal reiterating its previous finding that the right to counsel couldnot be waived.The applicant complained before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that his art.6 righthad been violated because the domestic courts refused him leave to represent himself as defendant in thecriminal proceedings.Held(1) The application was declared admissible (unanimous).(2) There had been no violation of art.6(1) and art.6(3)(c) (nine votes to eight).The Court considered the applicant’s complaint to essentially be the question of the scopeof the right of defendants with legal training to defend themselves in person but noted thatthe applicant was suspended from the Portuguese Bar Council’s roll and therefore could notdo so. The Court highlighted that a margin of appreciation is offered to states with referenceto the right to defend oneself under art.6 and sought to assess the mandatory representationof defendants in criminal proceedings under Portuguese law with reference to this.Recognising from previous case-law that requiring compulsory representation by a registeredlawyer is a measure taken in the interest of defendants, even if against their wishes, the Courtconsidered that this must be balanced against the defendant’s freedom to choose their legalrepresentation and must only be overruled where necessary in the interests of justice, andto ensure the fairness of proceedings as a whole.The Court noted that art.6(3)(c) grants the right to defend oneself in person or through legalassistance and considered a margin of appreciation is left to states in determining how thesealternatives are offered. This was justified as recognising both of these rights as absolutewould be excessive, and there is no consensus amongst states on how this choice of meansis offered.394 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsTaking into account the reasoning of the Portuguese domestic courts, the Court held thatthe state had not exceeded this margin of appreciation in preventing defendants like theapplicant from representing themselves, as they were not prevented from some choice intheir means of defence, and they did not consider that the fairness of proceedings wasadversely affected by these rules. They also noted that although the applicant chose not toparticipate in the criminal proceedings, he did not complain of lack of confidence in theexpertise of his counsel, and therefore did not point to any unfairness in his proceedings,but in principle against the requirement of mandatory representation.Cases consideredAnimal Defenders International v United Kingdom (2013) 57 E.H.R.R. 21Brualla Gómez de la Torre v Spain (2001) 33 E.H.R.R. 57Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v Romania (App. No.47848/08), judgmentof 17 July 2014Correia de Matos v Portugal (App. No. 48188/99), judgment of 15 November 2001Croissant v Germany (1993) 16 E.H.R.R. 135Dvorski v Croatia (App. No. 25703/11), judgment of 28 November 2013Fogarty v United Kingdom (2001) 34 E.H.R.R. 302Hatton and Others v United Kingdom (2003) 37 E.H.R.R. 611Ibrahim and Others v United Kingdom (2015) 61 E.H.R.R. 9Karpetas v Greece (App. No.6086/10), judgment of 30 October 2012Kyprianou v Cyprus (2007) 44 E.H.R.R. 27Mamatkulov and Askarov v Turkey (2005) 41 E.H.R.R. 25Mayzit v Russia (2006) 43 E.H.R.R. 38Meftah and Others v France (App. No.32991/96), judgment of 26 July 2002Quaranta v Switzerland (App. No.12744/87), judgment of 24 May 1991S.H. and Others v Austria (App. No.57813/00), judgment of 3 November 2011Sejdovic v Italy (2004) 42 E.H.R.R. 360Simeonovi v Bulgaria (App. No.21980/04), judgment of 20 October 2015Weber v Switzerland (1990) 12 E.H.R.R. 508X. v Norway (App. No.5923/72), judgment of 30 May 1975X v Finland (App. No.34806/04), judgment of 3 July 2012CommentaryThe majority judgment of the Court in favour of the state was met by a number of dissenting judgments,expressing disagreement with the finding of the majority that the Portuguese law preventing defendantsfrom representing themselves was within the margin of appreciation offered to states by art.6(1) and (3).The dissenting opinions of Judges Tsotsoria, Motoc and Mits, and of Judge Pinto del Aburquerque joinedby Judge Sajo criticise the majority’s holding with respect to the margin of appreciation, noting in particularthat the comparative legal analysis of the right to defend oneself failed to note the extremity of Portugal’sabsolute ban on self-representation. While the dissenting opinions noted that the right to self-representcould not be absolute, they considered that the comparative strictness of Portugal’s rule was a compellingreason that it should have been held that Portugal had exceeded the margin of appreciation.Further to this three of the dissenting opinions note the inconsistency of this decision with theinterpretation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on this matter. In a2006 Communication regarding the same applicant, the Human Rights Committee (HRC) had held thatCase and Comment 395[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthe applicant’s right to defend himself in person under the ICCPR had been violated. The dissentingopinion of Judge Bošnjak notes that while the European Court is not bound by the HRC’s interpretation,the inconsistency of these judgments represents a fragmentation of international human rights law, whichis damaging to its coherence.The dissenting judgments also consider in some depth the analysis of the overall fairness in proceedings,which the majority had held was not affected as the assignment of a competent lawyer to represent theapplicant ensured a good defence. However, the joint opinion of Judges Pejchal and Wojtyczek noted thatthe proceedings treated the accused as an object of procedure, rather than allowing him to activelyparticipate, which could not be fair. The opinion summarises that the Portuguese rule on mandatoryrepresentation is paternalistic, a sentiment that is strongly reiterated by Judge Pinto del Albuquerque, whocharacterises the majority judgment as “a return to the biases of the tormented black past of Europe, thosebiases that categorised defendants as objects in the hands of the almighty State, which could always dictatewhat was in their interests, even against their own will”.The decision of the majority to allow a wide margin of appreciation to Portugal in light of the lack ofagreement on the matter across the Council of Europe state is not surprising. However, it is both regrettableand worrying that the Court chose to not align itself with the HRC’s interpretation of the right to a fairtrial under art.14 ICCPR allowing for further fragmentation of international human rights law.Residency rights of stateless personsStatus of aliens—state dissolution—permanent residency—statelessness—citizenship—right to respectfor private and family life—art.8—discrimination—art.14—art.1 Protocol No.12Croatia; Discrimination; Right to respect for private and family life; Rights of entry and residence;StatelessnessHoti v Croatia (Application No.63311/14)European Court of Human Rights (First Section): Judgment of 26 April 2018FactsThe applicant, Mr Bedri Hoti, has lived in Novska, Croatia since 1979. The applicant’s parents, bothAlbanian nationals, were granted refugee status in the Former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia(SFRY) on political grounds and resided in Kosovo where the applicant was born. Mr Hoti applied for apermanent residence permit in Croatia in 1987 and was granted a temporary residence permit pending thefinal decision. In February 1989, the Ministry of the Interior informed the local authorities that theapplicant’s request was to be declined in line with a policy dictating that Albanian refugees be instructedto apply for SFRY citizenship. The applicant declined to apply for SFRY citizenship.The applicant was granted further temporary residency in the SFRY by the authorities in Kosovo validuntil 1991 whereupon Croatia declared independence from the SFRY. The applicant was called up toserve the local authorities in compulsory civilian service following the outbreak of war and was issued apermit for this purpose. In the intervening periodMr Hoti submitted an application for Croatian citizenship,citing his residence in Novska since 1979, his employment and, subsequently, indicating that he wasprepared to renounce his Albanian citizenship. Despite assurances given to the Novska police and theapplicant by the National Intelligence Agency and the Ministry of the Interior that there was nothingpreventing the applicant from acquiring Croatian citizenship if he provided evidence of his willingness396 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsto renounce Albanian citizenship within two years his application was dismissed in August 1995. A reportby the Novska police alleged that the applicant had been absent from his place of residence during thewar and the authorities considered that he had thereby failed to evidence five continuous years of residencein line with domestic legal requirements. The applicant’s appeal lodged before the Administrative Courtwas dismissed on the same grounds.In November 2001 the applicant reapplied for permanent residency in Croatia, citing inter alia, hisinability to obtain travel documents or a certificate of renunciation of citizenship from the Albanianauthorities. This request was similarly denied by the Ministry of the Interior in 2003 for an alleged failureto comply with theMovement and Stay of Foreigners Act, including the lack of national interest in grantinghim residency. Appeals lodged before the Administrative and Constitutional Courts were also dismissed,the Courts reaffirming the authorities’ argument that Mr Hoti had failed to provide evidence of threeuninterrupted years of employment. The applicant was granted five temporary extensions to his residencepermit on humanitarian grounds, however, permission was in the interim denied by the Ministry for afailure to provide a valid travel document and on appeal this reasoning was endorsed by the AdministrativeCourt.Bringing a claim before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) for violations of his art.8right to respect for private and family life, in conjunction with art.14 and art.1 of Protocol No.12 prohibitionson discrimination, the applicant alleged that he was not given adequate opportunity to regularise hisresidency status, that his opportunities to travel and work were negatively impacted, and that the legalframework itself is not equipped to provide a solution.Held(1) The issue of exhaustion of domestic remedies was rejected after adjoining it to the meritsof the case (unanimous).(2) The alleged violations of art.14 in conjunction with art.8 and art.1 of Protocol No.12 wererejected as inadmissible and manifestly ill-founded (unanimous).The applicant’s argument that the legislative framework itself discriminated against formerSFRY citizens was rejected on the basis that it had not been shown on the evidence that hehad ever held SFRY citizenship.(3) The claim under art.8 was declared admissible (unanimous).The Court rejected the argument of the Government that the claim should be struck out asthe matter had already resolved in accordance with art.37(1)(b) of the Convention owing tothe grant of temporary residency status on humanitarian grounds to the applicant.Distinguishing its previous case-law on the status of aliens following the break-up of a statewhere clear assurances had been given by the authorities, the Court held that the temporaryresidence status granted did not have the effect of removing the uncertainty of the applicant’sstatus.On the issue of temporal admissibility, the Court affirmed that although the Conventiononly entered into force in Croatia in 1997, the challenges encountered by the applicant inregularising his residency status should be considered a continuous situation and that anunderstanding of the previous facts was essential regardless.Finally, the Court rejected the argument of the respondent government that the applicanthad abused his right of individual application by making submissions to the Court that hewas previously a citizen of the SFRY. It was emphasised that the applicant’s citizenshipwas in dispute and had been stated differently on various official documents, thereby givingrise to reasonable doubt on his part.(4) There had been a violation of art.8 (unanimous).Case and Comment 397[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe Court emphasised two key distinctive aspects of the facts, namely the regularisation ofthe status of aliens following the dissolution of the SFRY and the statelessness of theapplicant. The Court distinguished the present case from its previous case-law on art.8 withrespect to the erasure of individuals from the register of domicile in Croatia in the wake ofthe dissolution of the SFRY and cases concerning the denial of rights to “settled migrants”as one in which the applicant had not already been legally registered or domiciled in Croatiaand one presenting a unique set of circumstances. Accordingly, the Court held that the art.8claim should instead be examined in the context of the existing case-law on aliens who wereunable to formally regularise their residence in the host state.The right to respect for private and family life under art.8 was held to entail a positiveobligation on the part of the state to provide both effective and accessible protection for theright. The judges noted that although the applicant did benefit from a private life in Croatia,his status was nevertheless uncertain and depended upon discretionary one-year extensionsrequiring either a travel document or the consent of the Ministry of the Interior to obtain.The evidence supporting the decision of the Government to deny permanent residency statusto the applicant on the basis that he could not demonstrate three uninterrupted years ofemployment was called into question. The Court held that although the applicant was absentfor fifteen days during his 1986–1989 employment period, the decision of the authorities toreject his application on this basis was “overly formalistic”, particularly in view of theguarantees of employment offered by the applicant.The impossibility of obtaining a valid travel document with which to apply for residencywas cited by the Court, along with the failure of the authorities to provide the applicant withadministrative assistance. The failure of the domestic courts to assess the applicant’s privatelife and other art.8 considerations on examining residency appeals was similarly noted. Itwas therefore concluded that the respondent state had not complied with the positiveobligation to provide effective and accessible procedures to enable residency to be determinedin accordance with the requirements of art.8.(5) The respondent state was ordered to pay EUR 7,500 plus any tax chargeable in respect ofnon-pecuniary damage and EUR 3,000 to cover costs and expenses to the applicant withina period of three months (unanimous).(6) The remainder of the claim by the applicant for just satisfaction was dismissed (unanimous).Cases consideredAbuhmaid v Ukraine (App. No.31183/13), judgment of 12 January 2017A.S. v Switzerland (2017) 65 E.H.R.R. 12B.A.C. v Greece (App. No.11981/15), judgment of 13 October 2016Blečić v Croatia (2006) 43 E.H.R.R. 48Fernández Martínez v Spain (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 3Gross v Switzerland (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 18Harakchiev and Tolumov v Bulgaria (App. Nos 15018/11 and 61199/12), judgment of 8 July 2014Jeunesse v the Netherlands (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 17Kaftailova v Latvia (App. No.59643/00), judgment of 7 December 2007Kurić and Others v Slovenia (2013) 56 E.H.R.R. 20Ramadan v Malta (2017) 65 E.H.R.R. 32Roche v the United Kingdom (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 30Shevanova v Latvia (striking out) (App. No.58822/00), judgment of 7 December 2007Sisojeva v Latvia (2007) 45 E.H.R.R. 33398 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsUdovičić v Croatia (App. No.27310/09), judgment of 24 April 2014Üner v the Netherlands (2007) 45 E.H.R.R. 14CommentaryThe Hoti judgment represents a significant advancement in the protection afforded to the right to privateand family life of stateless persons under art.8 of the Convention. The Court affirmed the broad nature ofart.8 as encompassing the right to develop human relationships, aspects of social identity, including thesocial and community ties of migrants. The Court, for example, expressly noted that the applicant had notmaintained familial or other links outside of Croatia and the long duration of his actual residency. Theunique complexity of the circumstances facing the applicant in the wake of the dissolution of the SFRYhowever, was similarly cited throughout the judgment as one of the core reasons for the uncertaintysurrounding the applicant’s status and may thereby limit the potential of the Hoti case as a precedent forother stateless groups.The language of the judgment was initially cautious and deferential, reaffirming the sovereign discretionof states under international law to decide upon matters of entrance, residence and expulsion of aliensfrom their territories. The judges took the opportunity to emphasise that the scope of the Convention doesnot extend to mandating the allocation of particular types of residence permit as this remains within theexclusive remit of the national authorities. The detailed intervention of the Office of the UN HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the present case served to highlight its international significance.The UNHCR underlined the flaws in the citizenship policies of SFRY successor states, arguing that agreat number of people had been left stateless and that there had been a disproportionate impact uponminority communities. The erasure of stateless persons unable to fulfil the criteria for temporary orpermanent residence in Croatia from the register of domicile had the effect of preventing those personsfrom regularising their residency to secure legal status and thereby curtailed the enjoyment of a range offundamental rights. The Court however, was careful to distinguish the present case from those involvingerasure of individuals from the register of domicile on the basis that the applicant was in fact never officiallyresident in Croatia and thereby avoided examining deficiencies in the law and policy framework morebroadly.The Court can nevertheless be seen to have taken a strong stand in protection of the art.8 rights ofstateless persons in Hoti, reminding states of the symbiosis between international law and the Conventionrights as they relate to the protection of stateless individuals.Right of access to Supreme CourtsLower courts—procedural errors—excessive formalism—bearer of procedural errors’ consequences—access to court—art.6(1)Croatia; Formalism; Proportionality; Right of access to courtZubac v Croatia (Application No.40160/12)European Court of Human Rights (Grand Chamber): Judgment of 5 April 2018Case and Comment 399[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsFactsThe applicant, Ms Vesna Zubac, is a Bosnia and Herzegovina national residing in Bijela (the Republic ofMontenegro). The event at the root of this case is a contract the applicant’s father-in-law entered in 1992for the exchange of his house in Dubrovnik (Croatia) for one in Trebinje (Bosnia and Herzegovina). Afterhe died in 2002, his son, MZ (who was also the applicant’s husband) took legal action before the DubrovnikMunicipal Court to cancel the contract on the basis that the latter had been signed under constraint in awar context and was disproportionate.From 2002 to February 2005, MZ was represented by M.C., a Montenegrin lawyer. When he first filedthe action, MZ indicated the value of the subject matter of the dispute at 10,000 Croatian kunas (HRK).At a hearing in April 2005, the new Croatian lawyer who had taken over the case, modified the value ofthe subject matter of the dispute from HRK 10,000 to HRK 105,000. The defendants opposed thismodification arguing its sole objective was to enable the claimant, MZ, to lodge an appeal on points oflaw. At the hearing, the Municipal Court did not take any decision on this specific matter and reserved itsdecision concerning the request for an injunction preventing any disposal of the property in dispute whichhad been asked by MZIn September 2005, the Municipal Court dismissed the claim and ordered MZ to pay defendants’litigation costs and expenses on the basis of the increased value of the subject matter of the dispute. InOctober 2009, MZ’s appeal was rejected by the Dubrovnik County Court. MZ then lodged an appeal onpoints of law with the Supreme Court of Croatia. His wife (the applicant) took over the case when he dieda few months later in October 2010.On 30 March 2011 the Supreme Court found the appeal on points of law inadmissible since the valueof the subject matter of the dispute was below the statutory threshold of HRK 100,000. Indeed, accordingto the Court, the value of the subject matter could not be modified later than at the preparatory hearing orat the first session of the main hearing. The applicant finally lodged a complaint before the ConstitutionalCourt which found the latter inadmissible on the basis that the case raised no constitutional issues.The applicant complained before the European Court of Human Rights that her right of access to Courtunder art.6(1) had been breached by Croatia.Held(1) There had been no violation of art.6(1) (unanimous).Concerning the restriction on the applicant’s access to the Supreme Court, the Court notedthat the applicant had lodged an “ordinary” appeal on points of law which the SupremeCourt found inadmissible on the basis that the value of the claim did not reach the thresholdof HRK 100,000. It relied on s.40(3) of the Civil Procedure Act to consider that the valueof the subject matter of the dispute had been changed too late. Moreover, the applicant didnot amend her civil action which was required by law for the value to be modified. Finally,the applicant could have lodged an “extraordinary” appeal on points of law (which does notrequire the HKR 100,000 threshold) but did not use this option.Concerning the question of whether the restriction pursued a legitimate aim, the Courtconsidered that the threshold pursued the legitimate aim of restraining access to the SupremeCourt only to matters of the requisite significance.Finally, the Court had to analyse whether there was a reasonable relationship ofproportionality between that aim and the means employed to attain it. The Court drew specialattention to three criteria. The first criterion, the foreseeability of the restriction, was metsince the Supreme Court’s case-law has been consistent concerning the need to modify thevalue of the subject matter of the dispute before the litigation stage. Moreover, the Civil400 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsProcedure Act is clear concerning the need to adopt a separate decision in order to modifythis value—which her Croatian lawyer should have been aware of. Secondly, the questionof who should bear the adverse consequences of the errors made during the proceedingswas analysed by the Court. It considered that the procedural mistakes were mainly andobjectively imputable to the applicant. Indeed, the fact that the Municipal Court had notruled on the applicant’s proposal to change the value of the subject matter of the disputeand had ordered the applicant to pay defendants’ litigation costs and expenses on the basisof the increased value, was an error. However, these errors could have been avoided if theapplicant had been more diligent in the first place. Thirdly, the question of whether therewas an excessive formalism restricting the applicant’s access to the Supreme Court wasconsidered by the Court. It found that the Supreme Court should not be bound by the errorsof the lower courts. To the contrary, the rule of law is a fundamental principle in a democraticsociety and the Supreme Court is there to ensure legal certainty and proper administrationof justice. It should therefore not turn a blind eye to procedural errors.Cases ConsideredAndrejeva v Latvia [GC] (2010) 51 E.H.R.R. 28Bąkowska v Poland (App. No.33539/02), judgment of 12 January 2010Běleš and Others v the Czech Republic (App. No.47273/99), judgment of 12 November 2002Brualla Gómez de la Torre v Spain (App. No.26737/95), judgment of 19 December 1997Examiliotis v Greece (no. 2) (App. No.28340/02), judgment of 4 May 2006Garzičić v Montenegro (App. No.17931/07), judgment of 21 September 2010Laskowska v Poland (App. No.77765/01), judgment of 13 March 2007Mohr v Luxembourg (dec.)

Furthermore,the Court considers that since Supreme Courts should only deal with cases of a certain importance, theestablishment of a financial threshold is legitimate and reasonable. However, in the application of thisthreshold which represents a restriction on access to the superior courts, the Court considers that threecriteria should be met. First, the restriction must be foreseeable. The Court has given particular importanceto whether the procedure to access higher courts was foreseeable as well as whether the judicial practicewas coherent and consistent. Secondly, the Court considers that the applicant should not bear an excessiveburden in respect to the procedural errors which occurred and prevented the access. If there have beenerrors on both sides (the applicant and the judicial authorities), the Court will analyse whether the applicanthas acted diligently and to whom the errors are mainly or objectively attributable. However, it should benoted that Supreme Courts are responsible to assess whether the threshold has been met and cannot bebound by errors made by lower courts. Finally, the third criterion to be met concerns the fact that restrictionsshould not involve excessive formalism. The Court considers that there has been a use of excessiveformalismwhen the procedural rules do not serve the aims of legal certainty and the proper administrationof justice and only prevent the applicant from accessing the higher courts.Case and Comment 401[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsRemoval of children from their motherDomestic violence—child abduction—foster care—forced removal—best interest of the child—right tofamily life—art.8Adoption; Best interests; Children's welfare; Norway; Parental responsibility; Parental rights; Rightto respect for private and family lifeMohamed Hasan v Norway (Application No.27496/15)European Court of Human Rights (Fifth Section): Judgment of 26 April 2018FactsThe applicant, Ms Ivan Mohamed Hasan, an Iraqi national born in 1979, moved to Norway in 2006 aftermarrying C, who is an Iraqi-born and had lived in Norway since 1999. Their first daughter, A, was bornin February 2008 and their second daughter, B, in June 2010.A heated argument took place on 7 April 2009 and a few days later, the applicant said C had hit herand attempted strangulation with an electrical cord. The mother and daughter were taken to a crisis centreand the next day the applicant was treated for pain and bleeding in hospital. She requested protection forher fear of C’s family finding and killing her and consented to A being placed in an emergency fosterhome. She withdrew the consent when discharged from hospital the following day and after welfareauthorities expressed concerns for the child’s safety should they move back in with C, the applicant statedshe did not wish to move back into his home. However, a few days later they moved back in with C andthe applicant refused to give evidence against him. Due to C’s previous violent behaviour, welfare authoritiesasked the applicant to consider moving back into the crisis centre or risk forced removal of her daughterand so the applicant complied with the request. While at the centre, she had contact with C and afterallowing him to enter the premises, the centre no longer wished to host her. A was placed in emergencyfoster care again due to uncertainties surrounding the ability of the mother to protect her child against thefather’s violence. In October 2009, the applicant was admitted into hospital due to a suspected ectopicpregnancy. The hospital staff felt so threatened by C’s aggressive behaviour that they notified the childwelfare authorities and he was described as “out of control’ when visited by them.Five months after the couple’s second daughter was born, both children were placed in emergencyfoster care in November 2010. During a contact meeting in June 2011 with their biological mother, thechildren were abducted by two masked figures, who also caused injury to the applicant. The biologicalfather was later identified as the perpetrator responsible for orchestrating the abduction. Based on thehistorical incidents, the authorities issued an emergency order to placing the daughters in emergency fostercare at a secret address and the children could not be returned to the applicant unless she had ceased allcontact with her husband and settled in her own flat. The parents appealed and this was granted in part sothey were allowed supervised contact with the children but the emergency foster placement was upheld.Returning them to the applicant would place them at risk and the children had now formed such a stableattachment to their foster parents that it would be harmful to remove them when they were considered sovulnerable as a result of the trauma they experienced with their biological parents.The applicant complained that the decisions to remove her parental responsibility for A and B and toauthorise their adoption had entailed a breach of her right to respect for her family life as provided for inart.8402 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsHeld(1) The application is declared admissible (unanimous).The Government did not contest that the domestic decisions are interpreted as an interferencewith the applicant’s right to respect for her family life. The Court, however, considerednecessary to examine whether this interference was “necessary in a democratic society’ toensure A and B’s “rights and freedoms” and secure their “health and morals” and whetherthis protection of the children’s best interests should be regarded as more significant thanthe adult’s right to private family life.(2) There had been no violation of art.8 (unanimous).The purpose of art.8 is to protect individuals and prevent arbitrary actions to be committedby public authorities. The notion of necessity however, as explored in the case-law considered,encompasses reaction to a specific social need which needs to be addressed. Nevertheless,a fair balance must be struck between competing interests of the parties involved with fairevaluations and assessments conducted—so in this case the child’s best interests trumps theparents right to a private family life because they placed their children at risk. The Courtemphasised that what is at the best interests of the child involved must be considered ofutmost importance over any other interests, thus overriding the parents’ wishes if needs be,and there is broad consensus surrounding this including within international law.The decision to remove parental responsibility was justified because it considered the bestinterests of the children. Domestic authorities were motivated by their commitment toprotecting A and B and ensuring they were adopted and brought up in a safe environmentby well-suited carers who the children had now formed attachments to. A and B had losttheir attachments to their biological parents and thus removal from adoptive parents wouldhave harmful implications for the children. Due to this best interest-centric view of the moredefenceless party in the case, there had been no violation of the applicant’s rightsCases consideredAune v Norway (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 32Gnahoré v France (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 38Görgülü v Germany (App. No.74969/01), judgment of 26 February 2004Johansen v Norway (1997) 23 E.H.R.R. 33Jovanovic v Sweden (App. No.10592/12), judgment of 22 October 2015K. and T. v Finland (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 18Neulinger and Shuruk v Switzerland (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 31P., C. and S. v United Kingdom (2002) 35 E.H.R.R. 31Paradiso and Campanelli (2017) 65 E.H.R.R. 2R. and H. v United Kingdom (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 2Wagner and J.M.W.L. v Luxembourg (App. No.76240/01), judgment of 28 June 2007Y.C. v United Kingdom (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 33CommentaryThe unfortunate set of facts and the decision of the Court that there had been no violation of the mother’sright to family life demonstrate the challenges in balancing parents’ rights and children’s best interests.A removal order can irreversibly separate families, having a tremendous effect on parents and their childrenand therefore both the national courts and the Court agreed that this could be used only as a last resort. InCase and Comment 403[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthis case, all other avenues and attempts to protect the children were exhausted before a foster care orderwas imposed. As the Norwegian ChildWelfare Act of 17 July 1992 explains, measures such as foster careshould not be maintained against the will of the parents unless the children are at risk of harm, physicallyor psychologically. Furthermore, although contact with biological parents is usually an entitlement, again,if for the sake of the child’s safety, it would be better to have no contact or knowledge of whereabouts,then this shall be the case.What was even more challenging in this case regarding the removal order is that nobody questionedthe ability of the applicant to raise her kids. The facts show that she had been granted a divorce by thetime the child welfare authorities were discussing the foster order; she had passed a Norwegian languagecourse; she had established a small social network in her town; and she was attending employabilitysupport sessions in order to improve her career prospects. However, her ability to provide suitable carefor her children was overshadowed by C’s threat and her inability to stop any contact with him. Thephysical threat he posed to the children and the traumatic experiences they had experienced because oftheir abduction were too high risks for the domestic authorities and the Court to allow any contact betweenthe parents and the children, although the mother was not a threat to her children herself.Despite the challenging facts, the unanimous decision of the Court shows that although it was ratherunfortunate to have the children removed from their mother, the best interests of the child dictate that theCourt has a duty to ensure a child’s development in a sound environment, and a parent cannot be entitledunder art.8 to have such measures taken as would harm the child’s health and development.Mistaken entitlement to unemployment benefitsUnemployment benefits—unjust enrichment—mistake of the state—legitimate expectation to acquireproperty—excessive individual burden—right to property—art.1 Protocol No.1Croatia; Overpayments; Peaceful enjoyment of possessions; Public interest; Recovery of benefits;Unemployment benefitsCakarevic v Croatia (Application No.48921/13)European Court of Human Rights (First Section): Judgment of 26 April 2018FactsAfter becoming unemployed, the applicant was awarded unemployment benefits for a duration of 468days starting from 11 December 1995 by the Rijeka Employment Bureau. In June 1997, she applied foran extension of the duration of unemployment benefits due to her ongoing inability to work. Her entitlementto unemployment benefits was renewed until further notice.However, in two decisions of March 2001 and April 2001, the Rijeka Employment Bureau terminatedthe applicant’s entitlement to unemployment benefits and ordered her to repay the amount of HRK19,451.69 (EUR 2,600) on the ground that she had continued to receive the payments beyond the statutorytime-limit. The applicant appealed seeking to annul the decisions. In September 2004, the AdministrativeCourt held that the decision regarding the right of the applicant to unemployment benefits was ill-founded.Yet, it reversed the second decision in respect of the repayment of the due sum and instructed the partiesto start civil proceedings before a competent municipal court in order to seek relief. The applicant’s appealto quash the 27 March 2001 decision was dismissed by the Rijeka Employment Bureau, and subsequently404 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsby the High Administrative Court in July 2012. Finally, the Constitutional Court declared the applicant’scomplaint inadmissible.Following the applicant’s rejection of an out-of-court settlement, the Rijeka Employment Bureau broughta civil action against her for unjust enrichment. She submitted medical documentation which proved thatshe suffered from poor health, and that she lived in a difficult economic situation due to her inability towork. The RijekaMunicipal Court decided that the applicant could not be held responsible for the Bureau’sown mistake. In 25 February 2009, the Rijeka County Court overturned the Municipal Court’s decisionand ordered the applicant to pay the due sum plus statutory interest on the ground that the legal basis forthe unemployment benefit had ceased to exist on 10 June 1998. The Supreme Court subsequently declaredthe applicant’s appeal on two points of law inadmissible and the Constitutional Court also dismissed herconstitutional complaints. Enforcement proceedings were instituted in 2013 and were still ongoing at thetime of the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) released its judgment on the applicant’s complaintsregarding an alleged violation of art.1 of Protocol No.1 and art.8 of the Convention.Held(1) The complaint was found admissible (unanimous).(2) There had been a violation of art.1 of Protocol No.1 to the Convention (unanimous).The Court had to determine whether art.1 of Protocol No.1 applied rationae materiae andwhether, in the specific circumstances of the case, the applicant had a “legitimateexpectation”, within the autonomous meaning of the Convention, of retaining the fundsreceived as unemployment benefits without her entitlement to those benefits being calledinto question retrospectively. In this case, the applicant had received the contested paymentsfrom 10 June 1998 to 27 March 2001 on the basis of an administrative decision entitling herto unemployment benefits. The social security authorities were solely responsible indetermining whether the applicant fulfilled the statutory conditions to receive such paymentsand in extending the applicant’s entitlement to those benefits. They continued to make thepayments albeit, under statutory law, she was only entitled to unemployment benefits for atime-limit of twelve months. The applicant had not contributed in anyway whatsoever tothe authorities making an error and her good faith in receiving the unemployment benefitswas not contested. In addition, there was no express mention of the expiry of the entitlementto the benefits on a certain date within the administrative decision, and it took three yearsfor the authorities to react to the undue payment. Therefore, the applicant was legitimatelyled to believe that she was entitled to these payments in order to cover for her living costsand basic subsistence needs.On the merits, the Court established that there had been an interference with the applicant’sright to the peaceful enjoyment of her possessions under art.1 of Protocol No.1 and whethera fair balance was struck between the pursued legitimate aim of the public general interestand the applicant’s right under art.1 of Protocol No.1. While it was noted that states possessa wide margin of appreciation in terms of implementing social and economic policies, sucha margin narrows when the competent authorities have committed a mistake which can onlybe attributed to them. The Court has held that states should be given the possibility to correcttheir mistakes in the context of the discontinuation of unemployment benefits, so as to avoidunjust enrichment. Yet, mistakes that are solely attributable to the authorities should not beremedied at the expense of the individual concerned. The applicant was found to have actedin good faith. Her belief that she was entitled to unemployment benefits was legitimatelybased on the Rijeka Employment Bureau decision, which did not expressly mention thestatutory time-limit of twelve months. Furthermore, the Court found that the authorities hadCase and Comment 405[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsfailed in their duty to act in good time and in an appropriate and consistent manner.Subsequently, the state failed to take responsibility for its ownmistake and placed the wholeburden on the applicant. The possibility of payment in sixty instalments offered by the RijekaEmployment Bureau to the applicant still represented a significant sum of money whichwould put at risk her subsistence, especially since the unemployment benefits were her onlysource of income. The national courts, in deciding on unjust enrichment, failed to take intoaccount the health and financial situation of the applicant.(3) The Court found it unnecessary to examine art.8 separately from the first complaint, sincethe arguments advanced by the parties were the same.(4) The judges rejected the applicant’s claim in respect of pecuniary damage. However, theCroatianGovernment was ordered to pay EUR 2,600 to the applicant in terms ofnon-pecuniary damage, as well as EUR 2,130 for the costs and expenses incurred beforethe domestic courts and the Court.Cases consideredAnheuser-Busch Inc. v Portugal [GC] (2007) 45 E.H.R.R. 36Bélané Nagy v Hingary [GC] (App. No.53080/13), judgment 13 December 2016Beyeler v Italy [GC] (2003) 36 E.H.R.R. 5Broniowski v Portugal [GC] (2006) 43 E.H.R.R. 1Chassaganou and Others v France [GC] (1999) 29 E.H.R.R. 615Chroust v the Czech Republic (App. No.4295/03), judgment 20 November 2006Depalle v France [GC] (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 17Freitag v Germany (App. No.71440/01), judgment 19 July 2007Gashi v Croatia (App. No.32457/05), judgment of 9 October 2008Hutten-Czapska v Poland [GC] (2007) 45 E.H.R.R. 4Iatridis v Greece [GC] (2000) 30 E.H.R.R. 97Konstantin Stefanov v Bulgaria (App. No.35399/05), judgment 27 October 2015Kopecky v Slovakia [GC] (2005) 41 E.H.R.R. 43Krstic v Serbia (App. No.45394/06), judgment 10 December 2013Moskal v Poland (2010) 50 E.H.R.R. 22Perdigao v Portugal [GC] (App. No.24768/06), judgment 16 November 2010Pine Valley Developments Ltd v Ireland (1992) 14 E.H.R.R. 319Platakou v Greece (App. No.38460/97), judgment 11 January 2001Radchikov v Russia (App. No.65582/01), judgment 24 May 2007Simecki v Croatia (App. No.15253/10), judgment 30 April 2014Stretch v the United Kingdom (2004) 38 E.H.R.R. 12Tunnel Report Limited v France (App. No.27940/07), judgment 18 November 2010Zammit and Attard Cassar v Malta (2017) 65 E.H.R.R. 17Zolotas v Greece (No.2) (App. No.66610/09), judgment 29 January 2013CommentaryThe Court was unanimous in its findings and essentially reaffirmed its previous case-law on the right toproperty and unemployment benefits. One notable aspect of this case is that, on the one hand, the Courtconfirms the existence of a wide margin of appreciation of Contracting States in respect of social andeconomic policies. Yet, such a margin narrows considerably when the action of the State would place anexcessive burden on the individual. The whole case was about finding a fair balance between the general406 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsinterest of the public and the interests of the individual whose right to property has been interfered with.In Moskal v Poland, the Court had ruled on the importance for the state to be able to correct its ownmistakes when the latter would result in unjust enrichment. This is essential to ensure that principles ofsocial justice are respected. However, in distinguishing the present case from Moskal, the Court placedemphasis on the interests of the individual who has benefited from unjust enrichment. Indeed, thecircumstances of the case were rather extreme, since the unemployment benefits were the applicant’s solesource of income and only allowed her to meet her subsistence needs. Moreover, she did not own a bankaccount or any significant property and was unable to work because of health reasons. This shows thatthe Court would carefully consider several factors, such as the margin of appreciation states enjoy, theerrors committed by states, and the financial situation of an individual in receipt of benefits, and that theCourt would limit the margin of appreciation states enjoy if the survival of an individual is at stake.Challenging adoption proceedingsGuardian—family relationship—adoption proceedings—right to respect for private and family proceduralrequirements—art.8Adoption; Children's guardians; Nationality; Right to respect for private and family life; Russia;UkraineLazoriva v Ukraine (Application No.6878/14)European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section): Judgment of 17 April 2018FactsThe case concerned an attempt by the applicant to become the legal tutor, a guardian for children underfourteen, for her sister’s (KTO) second child (KOS). The applicant had become the guardian of her sister’sfirst child, who also was staying with her in 2007 after the Mayor of Magadan had recognised that thechild’s parents did not take care of her. In 2007, KTO gave birth to KOS in Chernivtsi, with KOS’snationality disputed. In 2008, the Shevchenkivskyy District Court in Chernivtsi ordered KOS be placedinto an orphanage and, though this was overturned in a 2010 order by the same court, KOS was taken intocare numerous times between 2010 and 2012. During this period, the applicant visited her nephew. On 5July 2012 the Shevchenkivskyy Court deprived KTO of her parental rights in respect of KOS, holdingthat she had not cared for him and had not played a part in his upbringing.Having become aware of her nephew’s situation in July 2012 the applicant contacted the ChildcareService of Chernivtsi numerous times throughout the year expressing a desire to become the child’s legaltutor. Nevertheless, when the applicant travelled to Chernivtsi in October 2012, the applicant was unableto initiate proceedings as KOS had been adopted. SSV and SOV, a married couple who had met with KOSin the orphanage in August, adopted him after the Executive Committee of Chernivtsi accepted thatadoption was their preferred form of placement. During the adoption hearing, it was considered that therequested adoption was in the interests of the child in being raised in “stable life conditions and in [anatmosphere of] harmony”.On 1 February 2013 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Chernivtsi Court of Appeal arguing thatthey had failed to take into account the fact that KOS had close relatives; they had not checked KOS’snationality; KOS was a Russian national; they had not followed necessary procedures for the adoption offoreign nationals; and they had disregarded her requests to be the child’s legal tutor. In April 2013, theCase and Comment 407[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCourt of Appeal refused to examine the applicant’s appeal as it did not concern her right or interest inbecoming the child’s legal tutor and contained no matter which could be the subject of a separate claim.The applicant appealed this decision, claiming that the Court of Appeal had not examined her arguments,but the appeal was also rejected on 10 July 2013 by the Higher Specialised Court for Civil and CriminalMatters as it had failed to demonstrate that the Court of Appeal’s decision had been unlawful. This resultedin the applicant bringing the case before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) claiming aviolation of her rights under arts 8 and 6(1) of the Convention.Held(1) The case was declared admissible by the Court as it was not manifestly ill-founded withinthe meaning of art.35(3)(a) nor inadmissible on any other grounds.(2) There had been a violation of art.8 (unanimous).In determining the general principles involved within the case, the Court noted that theexistence of “family life” with regards to art.8 was “essentially a question of fact dependingupon the real existence in practice of close personal ties”. It was also recognised that closerelationships that fell short of “family life” would generally fall under the scope of “privatelife” within art.8. The Court then articulated the “essential object” of art.8, with the Courtstating that it is “to protect the individual against arbitrary action by the public authorities.”In acknowledging the object of the provision, the Court went on to accept that art.8 has bothpositive and negative obligations attached but these obligations do not have a precisedefinition. In applying these principles, “regard must be had to the fair balance that has tobe struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community as awhole”. In striking such a balance the Court also noted that, with regards to both their positiveand negative obligations, states do enjoy a certain margin of appreciation. Finally, the Courtstated that, while art.8 contains no explicit procedural requirements, an applicant must beinvolved in relevant decision-making processes to a degree sufficient to provide him or herwith the requisite protection of his interests.In applying these principles to the applicant’s case, the Court saw that there were three legalquestions to be answered: (i) whether the case concerns a right or interest protected by art.8,and, in particular, whether it concerns the applicant’s “family life” or “private life”; (ii)whether there was an interference with the applicant’s right to respect for “family life” or“private life”; and (iii) whether the Ukrainian authorities’ and Courts’ alleged failure to givedue consideration to the applicant’s intention to become her nephew’s legal tutor and/ortheir failure to involve her in the adoption decision-making process constitute a violationof art.8.With regards to the first question, the fact that KOS had never lived with the applicantand that she had only visited once in the five years before the adoption led the Court to findthe applicant had failed to establish a family relationship. Nevertheless, the Court did acceptthat the applicant seeking to maintain and develop her relationship with her nephew wouldbe covered by “private life” under art.8, with this the result of “private life” being consideredbroader and encompassing the “right to establish and develop relationships with other humanbeings”. Considering the applicant’s relation to KOS, the Court found that the case didengage the applicant’s “private life”. The Court then sought to determine whether the state’sinterference with the applicant’s art.8 rights was in compliance with the requirements of theprovision. The Court found that, although acknowledging the applicant’s intention, the statehad failed to consider the proposition meaningfully. Equally, they had failed to clarify whyadoption had served the best interests of KOS and, even though “she had acted diligentlyin line with the advice she had been given by the Childcare Service”, had failed to take into408 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsconsideration the applicant’s arguments concerning time constraints. As a result, theinterference with the applicant’s private life was not in compliance with the proceduralrequirements implicit in art.8 of the Convention.(3) The applicant’s complaint under art.6(1) was declared admissible, due to its relation to theart.8 claim. However, the Court considered it not necessary to examine separately as a resultof the finding of a violation of art.8 (unanimous).(4) The finding of a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction for the non-pecuniary damagesustained by the applicant (unanimous).Cases consideredA, B and C v Ireland [GC] (2011) 53 E.H.R.R. 13A.H. v Russia (App. Nos 6033/13 and 15 others), judgment of 17 January 2017Anayo v Germany (App. No.20578/07), judgment of 21 December 2010E.B. v France [GC] (App. No.43546/02), judgment of 22 January 2008Elsholz v Germany [GC] (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 58Fernández Martínez v Spain [GC] (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 3Harroudj v France (App. No.43631/09), judgment of 4 October 2012I. and U. v Norway (App. No.75531/01), judgment of 21 October 2004K. and T. v Finland [GC] (2003) 36 E.H.R.R. 18N.Ts. v Georgia (App. No.71776/12), judgment of 2 February 2016Vujica v Croatia (App. No.56163/12), judgment of 8 October 2015Zampieri v Italie (dec.)

First, althoughit was a prominent point of contestation, by both the applicant and within a supporting submission by theRussian Federation, the Court did not engage in any considered discussion revolving around KOS'snationality. The dispute concerning KOS’s nationality was put forward by the applicant and supported bya submission by the Russian Federation, claiming that, as his mother was Russian, the adoption of KOSwas in contravention of their obligations under the 1993Minsk Convention on Legal Assistance and LegalRelations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters. The Convention provides the rules for legal cooperationbetween member states’ courts in civil, family and criminal matters and is in force between the followingcountries: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russian Federation, Turkmenistan,Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, other than a discussion in the concurring judgment of JudgeYudkivska who argued that since the child had been born in Ukraine, he “automatically became a Ukrainiannational” under Ukrainian law and thus there was no question concerning his nationality, the majority didnot assess the nationality issue when determining the violation of art.8. Considering the contentious natureof this part of the complaint, the failure of the majority of the Court to discuss its status and implicationsin detail is surprising.The decision that the finding of a violation was itself just satisfaction is also interesting. In the judgment,the Court recognised that the applicant had her right to a “private life” interfered with by the state as theadoption had the effect of “breaking the link between the applicant and her nephew” and defeated herattempt to become his legal tutor. This was accompanied by the subsequent finding that the state hadviolated her rights under art.8 through the procedural deficiencies of the adoption procedure. Consequently,the Court asserted that the finding of the violation was in and of itself sufficient just satisfaction for theCase and Comment 409[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsnon-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant. However, this decision seemingly paid no attention totheir previous recognition that the applicant’s art.8 rights had been interfered with in the case. In thisregard the concurring judgments of Judges De Gaetano and Yudkivska are particularly illuminating. Inboth of their opinions, the Judges stated that the decision to have KOS adopted by S.S.V and S.O.V asopposed to having the applicant become his legal tutor was both “right” and “in the best interests of thechild”. Although not discussed within the main judgment, it seems that the Court considered that thedecision to adopt KOSwas indeed the best decision considering the facts of the case. Despite the acceptanceby the Court that the right to private life might be restricted by adoption proceedings, this is not enoughfor the Court to interfere with established adoption proceedings that seem to be in favour of a child’s bestinterests.Parliamentary protection from court proceedingsParliamentarians—civil proceedings—timed-barred proceedings—lengthy proceedings—right of accessto courts—art.6—lack of an effective remedy—art.13Greece; Immunities; Limitations; Members of Parliament; Right of access to court; Right to effectiveremedyDimitras v Greece (Application No.11946/11)European Court of Human Rights (First Section): Judgment of 19 April 2018FactsThe applicant, Mr Panayotis Dimitras, lodged a criminal complaint on 1 June 2007 with the Athens FirstInstance Court. He submitted that ET, in her capacity as General Secretary for Gender Equality of theGreekMinistry of Interior, Public Administration and Decentralisation, made false statements in the presson 4 March 2007 which amounted to slander against Dimitras in his role as Executive Director of thenon-governmental organisation “Greek Helsinki Monitor.”The applicant’s original complaint against ET was dismissed by the court on 10 January 2008, but anappeal led to the indictment of ET on 6 February 2008, with a hearing date set for 25 June 2008. On 17June 2008 ET unsuccessfully appealed the indictment, leading to a new hearing date of 18 September2008. In this hearing ET raised an objection concerning lack of competence of the trial court, leading tothe court declaring itself not to have competence, referring the case to the Athens Court of Appeal on 6April 2009. A new hearing date was set for 13 May 2009 but was postponed to 5 October 2009 citing amaterial witness’s absence as the reason. Because the courts had not been sitting at this time due toparliamentary elections, the hearing was again deferred to 17 February 2010. In this hearing, ET submitteda certificate showing that she had been elected to the Greek Parliament on 4 October 2009 and applied tohave the proceedings suspended in accordance with art.62 of the Constitution. The Athens Court of Appealsuspended criminal proceedings until ET was granted leave from Parliament. Following notification on16 July 2012 from the Greek Parliament to the Ministry of Justice that ET had ceased to be a member ofparliament as of 11 April 2012, the Court of Appeal published a judgment on 26 October 2012 in whichthe offence of which ET had been accused had become time-barred because more that forty-two monthshad passed since the alleged commission, thus ending the criminal prosecution on 21 March 2013.Dimitras complained to the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that the Greek Parliament’srefusal to waive ET’s parliamentary immunity, resulting in the allegedly committed offence becoming410 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorstime-barred, was a breach of art.6(1), which provides for the right to access to a court. Further, the Courtwas to determine if the length of proceedings before the domestic courts had violated the “reasonabletime” requirement, also provided by art.6(1), as well as if lack of effective remedy had violated both arts6(1) and 13.Held(1) The complaint related to the foreseeability of the legislation on statutory limitation wasdeclared inadmissible and the rest of the application admissible (unanimous).(2) There had been no violation of art.6(1) related to the applicant’s right of access to a court(unanimous).The Court, observing that the applicant complained that access to a court had been impededowing mainly to the Parliament’s refusal to lift ET’s immunity and the offence becomingtime-barred, and accepting that the offence became time-barred on 4 September 2010,considers that any subsequent events, which includes the refusal to lift parliamentaryimmunity, had no bearing on the complaint. The court reiterated that the right of access toa court is not absolute but subject to limitations, providing the state a certain margin ofappreciation despite the Court having final assessment. In this case, the “essence” of theright was not violated. In relation to similar cases in which the state failed to provide accessto the courts, the Court found that it was due to negligence or circumstances attributable tothe state, which in the present case was not identifiable. The Court notes that the delay inproceedings until 4 September 2010 was mostly the result of appeals, or unforeseen events,noting that the courts had conducted urgent preliminary enquiries and marked case files asurgent, taking all available steps to prevent the case becoming time-barred. Further, theCourt attaches importance to the accessibility and effectiveness of other judicial remediesavailable to the applicants, notably civil courts, and considers that the applicant did havesuch remedies and therefore there had been no violation of the right of access to a court.(3) There had been a violation of art.6(1) related to the length of the proceedings (unanimous).With respect to the length of proceedings, the Court found the period to be taken intoconsideration started on 1 June 2007, when the applicant lodged the criminal complaint, andended on 26 October 2012, when the Court of Appeal considered that the alleged offenceshad become time-barred. The total period of consideration lasted a total of five years andalmost five months for one instance. Noting no excessive delays prior to 4 September 2010,the Court notes more than two years had passed from the date the offence became time-barredto the attendant Court of Appeal judgment and that the government did not provide anyreason why the domestic courts waited for ET’s status as a parliamentarian had ended tohold a hearing to rule that the offence had been time-barred. Therefore, the overall lengthof the proceedings was held to be excessive, failing to meet the “reasonable time requirementand amounting to a violation of art.6(1).(4) There had been a violation of art.13 (unanimous).In relation to the applicant’s complaint under art.13 guaranteeing effective remedy beforea national authority for an alleged breach of art.6(1) to hear the case in a reasonable amountof time, the court observed that the Greek legal system did not offer the applicant at thematerial time effective remedy for addressing the length of proceedings. The Court notesthat here was nowhere for the applicant to remedy his right to a hearing in a reasonableamount of time as guaranteed by art.6(1).(5) The respondent State was ordered to pay the applicant:€3,000 in non-pecuniary damagea)Case and Comment 411[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsb) €600 in respect of costs and expenses(6) The Court dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.Cases ConsideredAl-Dulimi and Montana Management Inc v Switzerland [GC] (App. No.5809/08), judgment of 26November 2013Anagnostopoulos v Greece (App. No.54589/00), judgment of 3 April 2003Baka v Hungary [GC] (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 12Frydlender v France [GC] (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 52Kart v Turkey (App. No.8917/05), judgment of 3 December 2009Korkolis v Greece (App. No.63300/09), judgment of 15 January 2015Lupeni Greek Catholic Parish v Romania [GC] (App. No.76943/11), judgment of 29 November 2016Papachelas v Greece (2000) 30 E.H.R.R. 923Rokas v Greece (App. No.55081/09), judgment of 22 September 2015Syngelidis v Greece (App. No.24895/07), judgment of 11 February 2010Tsalkitzis v Greece (App. No.72624/10), judgment of 19 October 2017CommentaryThe facts of the case and the judgment reiterated the systematic failures of the Greek judicial system toprocess and hear cases in line with the “reasonable time” requirement of art.6. The Court relied on itsprevious case-law built by complaints brought against Greece because of lengthy proceedings. The caseis of interest, however, because of the role Parliament played in barring the proceedings. The applicantsought to show that the government had knowingly and deliberately, through acts of omission in perhapsa coordinated manner, proceeded without urgency in order to allow the statute of limitations on the allegedoffence expire. He argued that since the act had been committed previous to ET’s election to Parliament,the authorities should not have suspended proceedings. In this case, it was found that the offence becametime-barred before the refusal of Parliament to lift ET’s immunity, effectively simplifying the task of theCourt to establish if any undue barriers to access to the courts were apparent, finding that there were none.It is, however, of interest that the Greek Constitution has been misused in numerous occasions to protectParliamentarians from court proceedings even in cases that the wrongful acts had been committed beforeindividuals were elected to Parliament, and the technicalities of the case led to a missed opportunity forthe Court to closely review the issue.412 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsBook ReviewsDetention of Terrorism Suspects: Political Discourse and Fragmented Practices,by Maureen Duffy, (Hart Publishers, 2018), 320 pages, hardback, £70, ISBN:978-1-84946-8640.The week following the events of 13 November 2015, then-President Hollande addressed a full plenarysession of the National Assembly to present the methods and protocols to be undertaken under the stateof emergency. The death toll was announced at 130, the largest on French territory since the end of theAlgerian war. This is what Hollande, hardly popular, came to declare before the representatives of thenation: France was now at war.Counter-terrorism has pounded the drums of war for as long as we can remember it: my generation andthe one that came before has faced a vocabulary that has much to do with annihilation, control and powerthan it does about policing, enforcement and domestic illusion of peacetime. In a new opus by ProfessorMaureen Duffy, the political veil under which much of the mechanisms supporting the literary conscriptionis exposed for all of its noisy and dangerous purpose: to turn fear, the weapon and consequence of terrorism,into the weapon and consequence of governance. An extended part drawing parallels with Kafka’skaleidoscope provides an apt allegory for our times.We lawyers and scholars have long sought escape from the political miasma that has plagued our work,in all areas of conflict. It tried to set itself apart from political vocabulary, be unaffected by electoral cycles,and maintain a lexicon of its own. There is, however, no discipline as politicised as human rights, and nodomain more entrenched in myth as terrorism. Giving as much as a cursory glance at Professor Duffy’stable of contents is the equivalent of an intellectual whiplash: there is no event we have been spared, butnone that has not been a watershed element in the failure to provide an accurate, clear and universallyrecognised definition of terrorism. Professor Duffy covers policy, law, and especially popular expectationsreflected in media coverage that politicians feel the need to answer. The source material ranges far andwide, from published white papers to the now accepted twitter feed of the current US president. The secondchapter, on the aforementioned fragmented practices, exposes our shortcomings. As such, we leaveideological and political violence to be qualified by leadership or by the press, both of which holding avested interest in a specific event being labelled as such (or not). Professor Duffy details this overwhelminginfluence through examples that characterised the state of constant exemptions following 9/11. Reviewingexecutive orders and detention practices in the first few years of the “war on terror” 17 years later is anedifying moment. Without being repetitive, Professor Duffy questions our own vocabulary, positions andpress coverage with a humbling and at times sardonic gift of hindsight.What strikes the reader in Professor Duffy’s book is the impossibility to derive any form of legalcertainty in the ever-evolving landscape that matches political currents. This is, by any means, not newat all, but provides a context for the failures or successes of counter-terrorism policies and the consequentterror litigation. The political discourse hardly relies on vetted threat assessments, legal expertise orintelligence analysis that could allow both prosecutors and the general public to rely on its effectivenessand improve its sense of general safety. Such is the power of the word “terrorism”: the more we acceptthere are threats we cannot counter—a reality of counter-terrorism—themore fear spreads and contaminatespolitical governance in a way that leads to permanent emergencies. The situation in France or the US givesonly glaring and evident examples, but no country seems immune to the need to harness state power togain momentum.The rule of law is the second victim. Human rights are, at best, discarded, at worst, vilified. Ourprofession is described as lax, passive and yielding, three qualifiers that at no point reflect the reality of413[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorslegal transparency and accountability. In this seemingly endless race to control the narrative aroundterrorism, legal defenders appear absent or out of breath. The clean-cut, clinical chapter-by-chapterbreakdown of our current discourse by Professor Duffy is a breathless spiral into what can be describedas permanent emergency. The enemy is never defined, the threat is rarely assessed, the response increasesin seriousness, checks and balances are progressively dissolved. Duffy’s opus contains two outstandingcharacteristics: that of being an illustration of the whirlwind in which we are embroiled, and one of detachedmesmerisation as to the powers violence can unleash in societies that proved, ultimately, not to be sostable. A chapter on false premises and the otherisation of terror suspects follows a chronological orderthat displays the quick unravelling of legal norms after 9/11. It is worth mentioning, at this point, thatProfessor Duffy does not approach the event in an academic or detachedmanner. She painstakingly recallsher own day, explaining how the date itself became a concept, stuck in time, a watershed moment foreveryone at that time. We are all tempted to believe that we are not impacted by the emotional toll of bodycounts on terrorism. It would be a mistake. It is worth reflecting on this: it is possible to commit to humanrights and attached values while understanding that terrorism itself is a violation of human rights.Where are the lawyers then?Where are we in this constant instrumentalisation of human rights law andthe objective, reasonable nature of our duty in the face of the subjective and emotional component ofmass, indiscriminate attacks? We appear in litigation over the CIA rendition, detention and interrogation(RDI) programme, or before local courts challenging the state of emergency in France, Donald Trump’stravel ban, but we appear mostly overwhelmed. The definition of a crime has escaped us. It seems,throughout the book, it could well have never been within our remit to define this specific crime. Thedegree of exemption that it seeks has excommunicated the law from the political discourse. From thestruggle to grant habeas (Part II, Chapter 4) to executive “otherisation” of suspects and detainees (Part II,Chapter 5), we seem bound to lose.As such, no matter how committed lawyers and scholars can be to learning from excruciating violationsof human rights, it is the use of the press and the campaigns that will allow whether there will be a “FrenchGuantanamo” or a coalition to “eradicate ISIS”, that will not press for transparency on the use of lethalforce and argue for legitimacy before legality at international organs. We are scattered around the globeand, frankly, stretched thin: for if there is not a definition of terrorism, there could hardly be limits tocounter-terrorism and terror prevention, an idea already put forward by Professor Fiona de Londras (Fionade Londras, “Evaluation and Effectiveness of Counter-Terrorism”, invited lecture, Universitair CentrumSint-Ignatius Antwerpen, 23 October 2015). The domination of “terror” over political discourse is absoluteyet erratic.Many lessons are to be drawn from the whiplash caused by reviewing 16 years of politicallymanipulativecrimes: that the rule of law can provide the stability it needs, while still being beholden to an executivethat circumvents; that human rights have only begun the battle to win the hearts andminds of the populationit protects; that our institutions are lacking the political will to share the burden of terrorism definitionand application. In 2018, the threat is different, new, evolves as we have failed to, obsesses over technologythe way we do. It is impossible not to wonder if the largest impact ever made, besides the bodies of victims,does not simply lie with the anthology of political ignorance Professor Duffy has compiled. Her bookprovides a valuable, if depressing insight. It should be essential reading for politicians, practitioners andacademics. We know the story—we have lived through it, experienced it, and commented on it. We haveparticipated in the last 17 years; we have different degrees of influence and of input. It proves necessaryand healthy to take time to assess what has been done and what is coming, what our strengths are andwhere our flaws lie. Professor Duffy issued more of an anthology for the older generation, an analysis forthe new one. We may be at a crossroads, and it is time we identify what must be changed, starting withunifying and harmonising those fragmented practices to consolidate human rights protections.Sarah Kay414 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsOpinionStates of Denial: What the Search for a UK Billof Rights Tells Us about HumanRights ProtectionTodayConor Gearty*Bill of Rights; Brexit; Human rights; Political partiesAbstractThe drive by the Conservative Party to dismantle human rights protection in the UK has found a newfocus recently in the country’s planned withdrawal from the EU, and (it is said therefore to follow) theremoval of the Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights from domestic law. This is not to say that theParty’s old enemy the Human Rights Act has been embraced. This Opinion piece assesses the continuingpush for a UK bill of rights, a project that is likely, after Brexit, to return to centre stage. The author seesin the plan an indirect move towards the restriction of rights within Britain and in particular the withdrawalof rights protection from unpopular groups. For this reason he argues that the initiative should be resisted,however attractive the notion of a British bill of rights might seem to some to be.I. Double-edged lawMy late colleague at LSE, Stan Cohen, spent much of the last two decades of his life reflecting on howsocieties can successfully mask from themselves the harm they are doing, “knowing about atrocities andsuffering” while at the same time achieving “states of denial” about the impact they have—this being theriveting title of his most important work on the topic.1 With Christine Chinkin and Fred Halliday, Stanfounded the centre for the study of human rights at LSE, of which for seven years I had the honour to bedirector. Preparing for my interview for the post by swotting up in the usual way on those whom I had toimpress, I was struck by how Stan’s idea of denial fitted well with the thought I had had then of humanrights as “a visibility project”, as a means through which the unseen can make themselves seen, the ignoredimpose themselves on unwilling eyes with the assertion that they too are just as human as their reluctantwatchers. (The agency is important here, making clear the holders of human rights are not mere vehiclesfor another’s display of compassion and/or charity.)Of course, Stan Cohen saw law as a potentially important mechanism of denial:“Powerful forms of interpretive denial come from the language of legality itself. Countries withdemocratic credentials sensitive to their international image now offer legalistic defences, drawnfrom the accredited human rights discourses. This results in the intricate textual commentaries thatcirculate between governments and their critics or within legal-diplomatic loops and UN committees.*Professor of Human Rights Law at LSE, Barrister, Matrix Chambers. This Opinion piece is drawn from a keynote lecture delivered at the WGHartWorkshop 2018: Building a 21st Century Bill of Rights on 12 June 2018.1 S. Cohen, States of Denial. Knowing About Atrocities and Denial (Cambridge: Polity, 2001).415[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsDoes the second clause of article 16(b), para 6 apply to all the state parties? Do the minimum standardsof prison conditions apply to detention during interrogation? Interesting questions indeed.”2We are familiar with such techniques of evasion within domestic legal discourses as well as in theinternational sphere that Cohen identifies in this extract: “We care deeply about human rights; it’s justthat there was no breach here—and we have looked at it so very carefully with all our lawyers helping.”As Cohen put it, “Many such legalistic moves are wonderfully plausible as long as common sense issuspended”.3 Then a key paragraph for this short essay:“The type of legalism that appears to recognise the legitimacy of human rights concerns is moredifficult to counter than crude literal denials. The organisation [Amnesty; Liberty; the NGO involved]has to show that behind the intricate legal façade lies another reality … Interpretive denials are notfully-fledged lies; they create an opaque moat between rhetoric and reality.”4I believe that the push for a bill of rights for Britain is a move in the direction of this opaque moat, partof the construction of a new rhetoric of rights to mask our increased—and increasinglyaccepted—rights-abusing inclinations. With law comes legitimacy. Echoing Cohen, to be outwith theprotection afforded by any such bill is to be plausiblywithout rights whatever common sensemight suggest.As presently envisaged and in today’s political climate, a British bill of rights is certain to diminishrights protection in significant ways. The effect of making changes through enactment of substantiallegislation of this sort will be both to reflect and deepen further a disturbing shift that is already underwayin what we conceive of as human rights, or (now to put all the cards on the table) more accurately whowe think should be entitled to them—away from rights rooted in humanity and towards entitlementdependent on national belonging. The hint is in the title, a British bill of rights to replace a Human RightsAct. Our “real” or as Cohen might put it “common sense” idea of the inevitable universality of the ideaof human rights entails is already under threat. With a British bill of rights of the sort that is presentlybeing discussed it risks becoming a minority view, first eccentric and marginal, then eventuallyold-fashioned and quaint, and eventually forgotten. Common sense will have changed.Law can do this: progressives are used to applauding its power as a force for social improvement.These days we must beware of its potential in the other direction, its capacity in reflecting a political movetowards reaction and regression to drive that process faster and deeper, to pull intolerance and racismfurther in from the side-lines and place them centre stage.II. Changing rights-talkThese are large and aggressive claims about the direction in which a British bill of rights will take us, andthey need now to be justified. No bill of rights carries automatically these implications, casts these darkshadows around itself. In fact no bill of rights necessarily does anything in itself at all, speaks in anyspecific way about this or that. There is no essentialist core to what a “bill of rights” is, one that is separablefrom the circumstances of its enactment and its enforcement. As Lord Steyn once famously reminded us,“In law, context is everything”.5 That context has changed around what a bill of rights in the UK is imaginedto be, gone through various iterations in the past, and it is in relation to where we are now that the criticalremarks here need and can be defended.So how did we get to the point that it is claimed we have reached today? We already, of course, havea bill of rights, part of the settlement of 1688–89 and celebrated even by Mrs Thatcher who in the summerof 1988 led Parliament in a motion to “beg leave to express to YourMajesty our great pleasure in celebrating2Cohen, States of Denial.

(Perhaps we need something similar today, as the courts battle onbehalf of the legislature to resist executive demands on Brexit?7) Nine years before Mrs Thatcher madethese remarks, “[h]idden within Margaret Thatcher’s 1979 election manifesto” had been a promise ofall-party discussions on a bill of rights but once in power “this commitment [had been] air brushed away”.8In those late 1970s, the idea had been a reaction to the collectivism of the Labour administrations of HaroldWilson and James Callaghan, when the idea of a bill of rights was conceived by Tory strategists as a wayof impeding the socialist progress made possible by the “elective dictatorship”9 facilitated by the UK’sconstitution which so infuriated Tories at the time—until they got to exercise it themselves.It was probably for the same reason that Labour’s National Executive Committee refused to allowLabour’s first proposal to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights, in 1976, to be adoptedas Party policy.10 Things changed for Labour during the long period of Tory rule under first Mrs Thatcherherself and then John Major, such that by the mid-1990s the Labour leadership (first John Smith and thenof course Tony Blair) felt not only compelled but were also content to embrace the proposal for a newbill of rights as an early item on any new Labour administration’s agenda.11 This new bill of rights was inpractice always going to take the shape of the European Convention on Human Rights because, first, thisobviated the need for any drafting quarrels (exposing, no doubt, residual Labour concerns about impedingthe socialist dream) and, secondly, it was what leading judges were in favour of, thus draining the proposalof any (electorally dangerous) potential radicalism.12 Just as when Labour had agreed the right of individualpetition to the Strasbourg Court in 1966, here was a Party of the Left using rights law to declare itself lessscary to power than its public commitments might otherwise have suggested and than its opponents mighthave asserted.Why did the Human Rights Act not close down the debate about a bill of rights for Britain? Of coursethere were and are those for whom it is and always will be a limited document, covering not very muchat all, a half loaf in need of urgent expansion. But it is not these radical human rights aggrandisers whohave been making the critical running: the Human Rights Act has hardly been thrown out of kilter bydissatisfied human rights absolutists. As with so much else in our politics, the running has been made bythe Right. So what have these more conservative opponents of human rights been exercised about? Ofcourse some have been concerned about the record of the Strasbourg Court, the problem of “rights inflation”,the tendentious application of the principle of consensus, and much else of a similarly technical nature:Sir Noel Malcolm’s excellent critical monograph, Human Rights and Political Wrongs, published byPolicy Exchange in 2017, falls into this category.13 Malcolm’s new bill of rights would deal only with“real, essential rights”14 and there are proposals in the political arena that, it is true, take a similarly academic6House of Commons Debates, 7 July 1988, col.1233: https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107286 [Accessed 2 October 2018].7R.

But it is not what fires the public debate, this sort of scholastic engagement witha recherché legal specialism. Nor is it any move that is proposed in the exactly opposite direction, towardsa dramatically embellished document. Efforts to come up with a set of new and better rights are fairlyderisory from those driving this process: after all none of them is remotely interested in the commitmentto social justice that lies behind the Left’s flirtation with a bill of rights. Bits and pieces of the old commonlaw are added here and there in their occasional drafts but in the main it is more of the same sort of thing,civil liberties, due process and so on. No, what makes this subject political box office is not what the rightscover nor any supposed defects in their drafting or interpretation but—as earlier intimated—whom theserights reach.III. The reach of rightsThe shape of today’s bill of rights initiative has as its main design the limiting of the rights in any suchdocument to only a portion of those within the country to whom at present, under the Human Rights Act,these rights are available. The issue is with reach not content, the universality of the rights contained inthe Act rather than with their substance. Now, the portion of those in the UK who will still be able to availof these rights under any such new regime may well be large but it will remain a portion nonetheless.Basic rights will be for some—but not others. That is the point of this bill of rights debate, at least so faras those with the power to deliver it are concerned. Other, more innocent proponents of a wider, betterbill may have right on their side but they have no power to deliver what they want and so all that theirdestructive critique of the status quo does is play into the hands of those who do.To understand how we can possibly commit to a bill of rights which is partial in its application whilestill believing that we remain committed to human rights, as protagonists all still largely say and thinkthey do (at least for now), another of Stan Cohen’s mechanisms of denial floats to the surface, the timelessone between the “deserving” and “undeserving” or as Cohen put it, “some victims [of rights violations]are seen as more deserving than others” so “[c]ombining equity with social justice means that deservingvictims should be helped more than underserving victims”.15 Cohen has in mind individual situations butthe point applies just as well to the larger, legislative canvass. Once protagonists of our new bill of rightshave persuaded us of this distinction, turning the partisan arguments of the highly political into legislativetruth will not be that difficult: some of us “deserve” our human rights while others of us do not.So who is it that the Human Rights Act protects that the proponents of a brand new UK bill of rightswould seek, sub silentio on the whole, to exclude? Naturally of course it is foreigners, or to give them thenames by which they were initially camouflaged, suspected terrorists and asylum seekers. But it is alsobad people, in particular prisoners. The early running was made by the prime minister responsible for theHuman Rights Act itself, Tony Blair, inveighing about “barmy” court rulings such as the at-that-timerecent one which had protected from deportation Afghanis who had secured entry to the UK via a planehijack. Reacting to this and other decisions, Blair called on his Home Secretary John Reid to seek toachieve a better balance between liberty and security so far as human rights law was concerned and alsoto develop proposals to tighten the law on probation after one notorious case where a released prisonerhad murdered a 40-year-old woman, with probation staff having “been so ‘distracted’ by the prisoner’shuman-rights claims that they lost sight of their duty to protect the public”.16Indeed, around this time, combining two categories of the undeserving in one, a Home Secretary hadlost his job over a supposed failure adequately to manage the deportation of foreign prisoners.17 Withhindsight we can see here the beginnings of the populist turn that has so transformed our political culture15Cohen, States of Denial.

But in the mid-2000s it was largely seen-off at least so far as successive Labour governmentswere concerned. The plan to rewrite human rights law was dropped and the House of Lords’ decisiondeclaring the overt discrimination against foreigners in the post-11 September terrorism laws to be a breachof human rights was dutifully implemented.18When in 2006 the new Conservative leader of the oppositionrenewed his Party’s opposition to the Human Rights Act, naturally under cover of the proposal for a newand better bill of rights,19 Labour attempted a vague emulation of the policy but the Party’s heart was notin it.20That Tory initiative of 2006 was an early indication of what was to come.21 Today’s story begins in2010. The then Conservative leader David Cameron had a visceral dislike of the European Conventionon Human Rights in general and the European Court of Human Rights in particular, derived we can onlyassume from his time as a special adviser to Michael Howard in the Home Office, during which periodcases like Chahal22 andMcCann23 had created fury on the newly emerging populist Right. Time and timeagain during this period speeches and Party documents moved from technical critique of the Human RightsAct to boasts about how their proposals would deprive bad people—mainly foreigners—of rightsprotection.24 Conservative intentions with regard to human rights were of course initially hampered whenthey entered government by their ongoing dependence for power on their coalition partners, the LiberalDemocrats. They finally shook of the Liberal Democrats in 2015 and so were able if they so wished toforge ahead with the realisation of their plans for a new bill of rights.To make it even easier they had to hand by then a draft drawn up by one of their own strong supporters,Martin Howe QC, one of the many voices to contribute to the report of the Commission on a bill of rightsthat had been set up during the Conservative/Liberal coalition.25 That Commission agreed on very little,with the majority subscribing to the most bland and vague set of assurances about the need to have theConvention rights at the “core” of any new bill of rights26 and for such a document to be “written inlanguage which reflected the distinctive history and heritage of the countries within the United Kingdom”.27Martin Howe’s contribution was altogether more incisive.Article 26 of his draft Bill, headed “Application of the Bill of Rights as regards persons” was as follows:“1. The rights and freedoms in this Bill of Rights shall be enjoyed by individuals who are citizensof the United Kingdom.2. Citizens of other Member States of the European Union shall be entitled to those rights tothe extent provided for by or under the Treaty on European Union or the Treaty on theFunctioning of the European Union.18 “Reid humbled by U-Turn on Human Rights”, Telegraph (21 July 2006): https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1524451/Reid-humbled-by-U-turn-on-human-rights.html [Accessed 2 October 2018].19Mr Cameron’s Conference speech included the following on human rights: “I believe that yes, the British people need a clear definition of theirrights in this complex world. But I also believe we need a legal framework for those rights that does not hamper the fight against terrorism. That iswhy we will abolish the Human Rights Act and put a new British bill of rights in its place.” The full text of the speech is at https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/04/conservatives2006.conservatives [Accessed 2 October 2018].20 “Brown: We Need a Bill of Rights as well as Human Rights Act”, Guardian (25 October 2007): https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/oct/25/humanrights.constitution [Accessed 2 October 2018].

Non-citizens shall be entitled to the rights and freedoms in the Bill of Rights save for thoseset out in Articles …. ; and nothing in this Bill of Rights shall prevent restrictions beingplaced on the political activities of non-citizens.”Howe’s view was that that while “the core and central rights in the Bill should be enjoyed by citizensand non-citizens alike … it may be desirable carefully to consider whether some of the rights which aremore civic in nature ought to extend to non-citizens”.28 The Commission dissentients Helena Kennedyand Phillipe Sands regarded his approach as “deeply retrograde and inconsistent with a fundamentalprinciple, namely that rights should be secured for all persons within the United Kingdom withoutdiscrimination”.29 But if the plan for a bill of rights gets properly off the ground, it will be bound to developideas such as these since that will (in the absence of trail-blazing additions to rights) be the whole pointof the exercise. Howe is not to be faulted for his honesty or the clarity of his vision of the future extentof rights-protection.IV. Looking to the futureIf this view of what will happen is thought alarmist, let us consider the political context in which any suchproposal for a UK bill of rights would be likely to gain traction. The initial hostility to the Human RightsAct may have been rooted in a dislike of certain kinds of foreigners and bad people—asylum seekers andterrorists, prisoners as well—but it quickly got dragged into the Conservative Party’s civil war on Europe.The notoriousHirst decision in 200530 was the route in for fresh critique of the European Court of HumanRights at a time when Eurosceptics like David Davis—a key player in making Hirst centre stage—couldnot have imagined themselves taking on their true enemy—Brussels—and so were content to settle forsmaller Strasbourg fry. How times change. That war in the Tory party has of course now been conclusivelywon by the UKIP faction and as they ham-fistedly and chaotically “take back control” they find themselves,for now, with no energy to continue hostilities with what was after all always for them only a proxy enemy.The Hirst line of cases is being implemented and ministers have put the bill of rights on the back-burner.31But when the dust settles on Brexit what then? The decline in Britain’s status and prosperity will alreadyhave become evident even to the most fervent little Englanders. The UKIP faction will remain in controlof the Conservative Party. An election will have to be fought and won, the carcass of British sovereigntystill judged worth fighting for by those who have done so much to destroy its living essence. The searchwill be on for the scapegoats necessary to blind the electorate to the reality of the country’s impotence.The EU will remain the default enemy even after Brexit. So too might well the millions of Irish whoremain in Brexit Britain, blamed for Irish intransigence in not obeying its former master on the Europeanquestion, and the foreigners—as essential as ever to keeping England’s show on the road—will haveresolutely refused to leave. The bill of rights proposal will return, its protagonists now more open thanever about their desire to limit it to citizens. The Council of Europe will be the new European institutionthat it will be essential to leave, so as to enable a “taking back control” of our liberties and rights. Andwhile the European Court of Human Rights could live with a lot of changes in the name of subsidiarity itwill not be able to tolerate the explicit removal of rights from non-citizens. We have seen exactly this playout in the summer furore over the Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s enthusiasm for facilitating the trial andpossible execution of two men who have recently been deprived of their UK citizenship.32 The usual28Commission on a Bill of Rights.

At the time of writing the Government420 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsBrexiteer activists led the charge via the usual papers with Strasbourg and the Human Rights Act beingtheir main targets. And, reflecting the theme of this article, the complaint was not about human rightsprotection per se but about its unwarranted extension to these nasty (truly non-British) people.33 It maybe that an EU withdrawal agreement will insist on the continued oversight of UK law by the StrasbourgCourt but this will not save the Human Rights Act of course and will also certainly not stop obsessiveBrexiteers arguing that such commitments should, post-Brexit, be ignored.The proponents of a new bill of rights for Britain do not necessarily know what they are advocating:as we have seen with Brexit, ambition combined with stupidity leads to an intentional neglect of detail,which can then be devastating when camouflaged by a mode of expression and confidence of demeanourthat misleads gullible listeners with its appearance of intelligence. The UK Labour Party provides littlecause for hope: Labour’s chances of winning any post-Brexit election under an aging and possibly pro-Brexitleader trying only to repeat his great success of 2017 in not losing too badly are surely not as high as theyought to be. There is scope for optimism, however, in the vigour of Scotland’s engagement with humanrights, in what is likely to be a rebellion against the DUP in Northern Ireland when the nature of the Brexitsettlement comes more clearly into view, and even (though this would run against the grain of generationsof judicial conservatism) in the willingness of the courts to engage in the fabrication of some kind oftradition of common law rights.34The direction of travel towards a meaner and nastier Britain with its chauvinist Bill of Right has to beresisted—the Human Rights Act with its respect for parliamentary sovereignty and equality of esteemmust be our last stand, against (to borrow a term from the Government’s description of post-Brexit Britain)an Armageddon35 in which a new kind of apartheid is created, with a rights-abiding society on one sideof the line and the chaos of state-supported oppression (of the supposedly “undeserving”) on the other.

Since the UK’s first non-local poll in 1973, there have been a total of 13 referendums,including three UK-wide votes. The twomost recent referendums—2014 Scottish independence referendumand 2016 referendum on Brexit—have dominated the politics of the past five years. Yet there has beenlittle thought as to how referendums fit into the UK’s wider democratic system, with parliamentarysovereignty at its heart. Legislation was introduced in 2000 to regulate the conduct of referendums, butit is limited in scope and is now 20 years old. Given deep changes in the nature of political communicationsand democratic expectations, it is badly out of date. Reform is urgently needed.For these reasons, the Constitution Unit at University College London established an IndependentCommission on Referendums last year. Comprising 12 distinguished individuals drawn from all sides ofrecent referendum debates, the Commission worked for nine months and delivered its report this summer.1It makes almost 70 recommendations to improve the use and conduct of referendums, which stem fromthree core points:• First, referendums have an important role to play within the democratic system, but howthey interact with other parts of that system is crucial. They should be viewed as co-existingalongside, rather than replacing, representative institutions. They can be useful tools forpromoting citizen participation in decision-making, but they are not the only, or necessarilythe best, way of doing so.• Second, referendums should be conducted in a way that is fair and effective. The rules shouldenable a level playing field between the competing alternatives. Those rules should alsoempower voters to find the information they want from sources they trust, so that voters feelconfident in the decisions they reach.• Third, the regulation of referendums must keep up with the changing nature of politicalcampaigning, particularly campaigning through social media.The role of referendums in the democratic systemMost democracies set out in their constitutions or in other higher law the circumstances in whichreferendums can or should be held and the mechanisms through which they can be triggered. Such*Constitution Unit, Department of Political Science, University College London1 Independent Commission on Referendums, Report of the Independent Commission on Referendums, London, Constitution Unit, 2018, availableat: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/research/electionsandreferendums/icreferendums [Accessed 3 October 2018].[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors422institutionalised rules determine the purposes for which referendums are used, what processes mustsurround a referendum and how referendums interact with representative institutions.By contrast, the UK has very few such rules. Referendums are mandated ad hoc by primary legislation.Conventions have emerged for holding referendums on fundamental constitutional questions to do withdevolution and the EU; in some cases, these conventions have even been codified in law. Nonetheless,the use of referendums has largely been driven by political pragmatism rather than constitutional principle.That is not to say that referendums cannot play a valuable role in the UK. In the absence of a codifiedconstitution, they can provide a mechanism for entrenching key constitutional features: decisions explicitlyendorsed by the electorate are hard to reverse without further reference to the people. The 1997 referendumson Scottish andWelsh devolution and 1998 referendum on the Good Friday Agreement are good examplesof this. But, in the absence of a stronger legal framework regarding their use, decision-making byreferendum is far less protected than in many other democracies, and therefore additional caution isrequired.The Commission considered whether politicians’ discretion to call referendums should be regulated.In the absence of a codified constitution, however, it would be difficult to restrict the topics on which areferendum could be held, and the lack of consensus on the topics on which a referendum should berequired, beyond those already set out in statute, would make mandatory referendums difficult too.Rather than introducing new rules on when referendums can be held, the Commission therefore urgesthe development of new norms: we need a broad culture change in how referendums are conceived in ourdemocracy. It has become commonplace over the last 25 years for politicians, political parties, andcampaigners to promise or call for referendums on a whole variety of issues when doing so seemed likelyto bring them benefits: defusing a disagreement, giving the appearance of taking an issue seriously, ordrawing attention to an idea. But, as we now know, a referendum on a major issue is a big event: quiteapart from the impact of the decision made through the referendum, which can be very large, the processof holding the referendum and its aftermath can be deeply polarising and strain the rest of the politicalsystem.Political actors should think carefully before committing to hold a referendum and, if they do so, theyshould adhere to best practice. Above all, that means ensuring that any proposal for change is preparedand scrutinised in detail. Referendums work best when they come at the end of a thorough policydevelopment process. The recent Irish Citizens’ Assembly, which paved the way for that country’sreferendum on abortion, offers a promising model for the future. The Commission urges that a range ofmechanisms for preparing for referendums should be explored in the UK. Sometimes, referendums madebe replaced entirely with other, more deliberative, forms of citizen participation, combined with thoroughparliamentary scrutiny.The Commission also argues that, wherever possible, referendums should be post-legislative: theyshould be held on a precise proposal that has already passed through parliament. That is the rule in manydemocracies, such as Denmark and Ireland. This ensures that the proposals are specific and fully developed,and that they have the support of parliament. Pre-legislative referendums held on general principles riskthat the proposals are unclear, making it difficult for voters to make a fully informed choice and difficultfor parliament to know what exactly they have been asked to implement.There may, however, be some circumstances in which holding a post-legislative referendum is notpossible: for example, when a referendum is required to begin a process, such as the negotiation of Scottishindependence. In such cases, a two-referendum process may be necessary. The government calling thereferendum should provide as much clarity as possible for voters, producing a detailed White Paper onwhat it intends to happen in the event of a vote for change. The legislation enabling the referendum shouldset out the whole decision-making process. If the plan set out in the White Paper is delivered, the changePoint of View 423[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorscan go through. If not, a further referendumwould be required. It would be for the parliament or assemblythat passed the legislation to decide whether that further referendum is needed.The regulation of referendum campaignsSince the current legislation regulating referendums called by the UK parliament—the Political Parties,Elections and Referendums Act (PPERA)—was enacted in 2000, we have held five referendums underits terms, and the nature of campaigning has changed considerably. Learning lessons from past UKreferendums and taking inspiration from international practice, the Commission has considered all aspectsof the conduct of campaigns and makes recommendations on how this framework could be improved.In the run-up to the EU referendum, the UK government’s decision to spend £9.3 million on a leafletadvocating a vote to remain created significant controversy. PPERA bans governments from publishinganything relating to a referendum within 28 days of the poll. But this allows for unlimited spending in theearly weeks of the campaign, potentially tilting the playing field. The Commission recommends thatrestrictions should be extended to the whole of the campaign period, but narrowed to apply only tocampaigning activity so that the business of governing can go on.The system of formally designating a lead campaigner on each side of the debate in referendums isunique to the UK. The Commission believes that it works well, but that the process of designation couldbe improved. First, it should take place earlier: at present, it could happen as late as four weeks beforepolling day, leaving campaigns with little time to prepare. Further, if there are two applications for oneside and only one for the other, as happened prior to the EU referendum, the latter can be confident ofdesignation and therefore gain an advantage in terms of planning. Second, as referendum campaignersreceive public money, their leading figures should be subject to a “fit and proper person” test.The UK has a more comprehensive framework of financial regulation of campaigns than most otherdemocracies, even those that hold more referendums. But improvements could still be made. Data hasbecome a valuable “alternative currency” for campaigners, so the Information Commissioner’s Officeand the Electoral Commission should consider how they can best work together to accurately capture thetrue cost of campaigns. A challenge particular to the financial regulation of referendums is ensuringaccountability when campaign groups are temporary. At present, large campaigns have six months tosubmit their spending returns. Reducing this to three months could allow faster action where necessary.Since 2000 the nature of campaigning has changed dramatically and has increasingly moved online,this poses a number of challenges for referendum regulation.2 Unlike in the broadcast media, there are norestrictions on the use of online paid political advertising. This is consistent with print media but there isa question as to whether such disparities remain justified—the Commission urges an inquiry into politicaladvertising across all media. A further problem is that many of the rules to promote transparency are notfit for purpose in regulating online campaigning. For example, imprint rules requiring campaign materialsto declare their source only apply to printed materials. Campaign spending categories make it almostimpossible to tell what campaigners are spending on social media. The Commission recommends thatthese gaps in transparency be closed and that a repository of online political advertising should be created.Implementing the Commission’s recommendationsImplementing the Commission’s recommendations will require changes of different kinds. First, the normsand expectations surrounding the use of referendums will need to shift. The Commission urges anyoneproposing a referendum to think carefully about whether a referendum is the best mechanism for that2See A. Renwick and J. Sargeant, ‘What new challenges does the changing nature of campaigning pose for referendum regulation?’ The ConstitutionUnit Blog, 9 January 2018, available at: https://constitution-unit.com/2018/01/09/what-new-challenges-does-the-changing-nature-of-campaigning-pose-for-referendum-regulation/ [Accessed 2 October 2018].424 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsdecision, whether adequate preparation has taken place, and whether the proposals are sufficiently clear.Its report sets out a checklist of points that ought to be considered. Second, some recommendations willrequire changes in legislation. This should be done for referendums in general: at the UK level, PPERAshould be amended; the Commission also urges the devolved administrations to consider introducinggeneric legislation on the conduct of referendums in their jurisdictions. Finally, the Commission identifiesa number of areas that deserve further inquiry, and it hopes these will be taken forward.Point of View 425[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and

The article deals with questions related to internationalcommitments and legal framework on curbing illicit financial flows applicable in Switzerland, how theautomatic exchange of information for tax purposes works, how to reduce corporate tax abuse and harmfultax competition, the institutional and legal framework for tracing stolen assets and curbingmoney-laundering, including aspects related to prosecutions and freezing, confiscation and repatriationof stolen assets. While good practices are identified, it also indicates areas where there is room forimprovement.I. Illicit financial flows and human rightsIllicit financial flows in a narrow sense are funds which are illegally earned, transferred or utilised, andinclude all unrecorded private financial outflows that drive the accumulation of foreign assets by residentsin breach of relevant national or international legal frameworks.1 The illicit nature stems from two distinctbut overlapping causes: the first relating to the proceeds of crime, the second initially deriving fromlegitimate economic activities that ultimately become illicit owing to the contravention of laws.In a broader sense, illicit financial flows encompass in addition all kinds of artificial arrangements thathave been put in place for the essential purpose of circumventing the law or its spirit, including certainlegal “tax-optimisation” schemes, making use of legal loopholes that allow, for example, transnationalcorporations to shift around profits to zero or low corporate tax jurisdictions, without undertaking anyreal economic activities in those jurisdictions.2Activities related to illicit funds can also be clustered according to the illicit motivations involved.3Those may be market and regulatory abuse, tax abuse, tax evasion or abuse of power, including the theftof state funds and assets, and the profit from crime or corruption. Commonly used methods to evade oravoid taxation include trade misinvoicing and transfer mispricing. Transfer mispricing refers to a practiceof multinational companies: a subsidiary of a company avoids paying taxes in a relatively high-tax countryby selling its products at a loss to a subsidiary in a low-tax country, which then sells the product to final*United Nations Independent Expert on Debt and Human Rights.

While tax evasion, which breaks national tax laws, isillegal, many tax avoidance schemes comply with existing laws and regulations, or at least go unchallengedin situations where tax authorities have scarce capacity and information.While it is recognised that estimates of the amount of illicit financial flows leaving developing countriesare, to some extent, imprecise, such flows are deemed to be substantial.4 The amount of illicit financialflows leaving developing countries may be close to $1 trillion per year,5 most of which can be linked totrade, tax evasion and tax avoidance.6 A significant percentage of such funds are deposited in financialcentres, depriving developing countries of financial resources vital for the realisation of economic, socialand cultural rights.The Paradise Papers of 2017, the Panama Papers of 2016 and the Swiss Leaks of 2015 indicated thatpolitically exposed persons, high-net-worth individuals and transnational corporations are particularlylikely to engage in cross-border tax evasion or avoidance, corruption or the misappropriation of publicfunds.7 The likelihood of such deviance is higher among such actors owing to their positions of powerand their ability to engage in cross-border financial transactions, or to the significant personal or corporatebenefits that encourage such harmful behaviour.Illicit financial flows are a global phenomenon and have adverse effects on all countries, which arelosing tax revenues and funds for domestic investment. However, those effects are particularly harsh fordeveloping countries, which frequently lack adequate financial resources for establishing well-functioninginstitutions in the fields of education, food security, health, social security, water and sanitation, justiceand law enforcement.8Reality shows that more resources will not always be translated into more investmenton social welfare, as those could be appropriated by domestic elites and/or still existing onshore taxevasion. Yet, available resources are a precondition for those governments willing to promote the realisationof economic and social rights of the population, besides other adverse human rights implications that illicitfinancial flows entail (see below) which must be prevented.Illicit financial flows nourish unsustainable debt and undermine efforts to enhance genuine socialdevelopment. States and the international community have acknowledged the adverse effects of illicitfinancial flows in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Target 16.4 of the SustainableDevelopment Goals explicitly notes the commitment of states to significantly reduce illicit financial andarms flows, strengthen the recovery and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of organised crime.In this context, the approval in 2016, by the Swiss Federal Council, of a report on illicit financial flowsfrom developing countries needs to be highlighted.9In order to meet target 16.4, countries of origin and of destination must make joint efforts. This primarilyrequires taking appropriate steps to prevent illicit financial flows from entering its financial sector and toensure that banks operating in any given country exercise due diligence with clients, in particular politicallyexposed persons and high-net-worth individuals. Such efforts also entail ensuring financial transparencyand participation in multilateral exchanges of information in the field of taxation to reduce the likelihoodthat individuals can engage, undetected, in tax evasion and tax avoidance. In addition, sanctions should4Regarding definition of illicit financial flows, see, e.g. A/HRC/31/61 and A/HRC/28/60.

They also undermine efforts to build up effective institutions to uphold civil and political rightsand the rule of law in the countries of origin. Illicit financial outflows and their non-repatriation underminecivil and political rights and the rule of law in countries of origin and destination. The existence of illicitunregulatedmoney contributes to the spread of other criminal activities, such as illegal weapons, smuggling,terrorism and the infiltration of criminal interests in the public sector. That includes funding of politicalparties or election campaigns in contravention of domestic regulations, contributing to the risk of statecapture and subverting the right to vote and to participation in public affairs on a non-discriminatory basis.All in all, the flow of illicit funds destroys trust in public institutions and the rule of law, and it shrinksthe fiscal space for investing in public health care, education, social security and other public goods andservices. Illicit financial flows also contribute to the build-up of unsustainable debt as governments lackingdomestic revenue may resort to external borrowing.11Are the Swiss policies and efforts at national and international levels, aimed at curbing illicit financialflows and their impact on the enjoyment of human rights within and outside the country, effective andcomprehensive? Is there room for improvement? These are the core questions this article tries to answer.Why assess Switzerland and its policies towards curbing illicit financial flows? This country is aprominent financial centre and a leading global location for cross-border management of private assets,with an estimated world market share of 25 per cent. The Swiss financial sector accounts for 9.1 per centof gross domestic product (GDP) and assets held in Swiss banks by non-resident custody account holdersamount to SwF 2.92 trillion.12 Integration of human rights due diligence into the financial sector andlending policies of Switzerland would therefore significantly reduce risks and prevent adverse humanrights impacts. At the same time, this country study could help make global policy discussion aroundillicit financial flows more informed and realistic.In my capacity as United Nations Independent Expert on Foreign Debt and Human Rights, I conductedan official visit to Switzerland from 25 September to 4 October 2017. The mission report, which this pieceis based on,13 was presented and discussed by the Human Rights Council on 28 February 2018. The mainobjective of the mission was to study Swiss policies and efforts, at the national and international levels,aimed at curbing illicit financial flows, tax abuse and corruption and their impact on the enjoyment ofhuman rights within and outside Switzerland.

Finally, in Section V concluding remarks andrecommendations are presented for discussion.II. Efforts and challenges related to the curbing of illicit financial flowsThe policies of Switzerland in relation to illicit financial flows have seen a positive change. Since 2008,many initiatives have been undertaken to strengthen the regulation of the Swiss banking sector, followingrevelations that banks domiciled in Switzerland facilitated tax evasion or lacked adequate due diligenceprocedures to prevent politically exposed persons from using Swiss jurisdiction to hide stolen assets.These policies are set out in a 2016 report of the Federal Council and include efforts to prevent and combatillicit financial flows by addressing the root causes of such flows in countries of origin,15 including throughinternational development cooperation.1. BackgroundBefore 2009, there was widespread cross-border tax evasion by foreign nationals from various jurisdictions,facilitated by banks operating in Switzerland. The data relating to tax evasion by US tax payers is revealingin itself. In 2009, UBS reached a $780 million settlement for facilitating tax evasion by US taxpayers. Bythe end of January 2016, 80 additional banks operating in Switzerland had entered into non-prosecutionagreements with the US Department of Justice. The list of banks includes the Swiss branches of manywell-known international commercial banks. The non-prosecution agreements include statements of factsproviding details about how the respective banks or their employees had organised tax evasion schemesfor their clients. Under the “Swiss Bank Programme”, banks received a penalty based on the value of theassets held in undisclosed accounts. In total, the penalties imposed amounted to over $5.5 billion.16There are no indications that such practices have been limited exclusively to clients in one jurisdiction.For example, account documents leaked from the Geneva-based private banking arm of HSBC, a foreignbank operating in Switzerland, indicated that HSBC had business relationships with people from dozensof countries, among them several alleged tax dodgers, dictators and traffickers in blood diamonds and analleged arms dealer who channelled mortar bombs to child soldiers in Africa.17In April 2016, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority pointed out that, despite significantefforts to adopt legislation and improve procedures to detect suspicious transactions, the risk of continuedabuse of the Swiss financial market for the purpose of money-laundering had not been eliminated.18Reportsof the suspected involvement of financial institutions in facilitating tax evasion or money-laundering havecontinued to appear in the media.19 The risk is also highlighted by the involvement of several Swiss banksin the Petrobras corruption scandal and in the suspicious cash flows linked to the 1Malaysia DevelopmentBerhad (1MDB) sovereign fund,20 the subject of an investigation triggered by a report of a suspicioustransaction by a Swiss financial institution to the Swiss Financial Intelligence Unit.15 Federal Council, “Unlautere und unrechtmässige Finanzflüsse aus Entwicklungsländern” in German only, 12 October 2016.16United States Department of Justice, “Swiss Bank Programme”, available at:www.justice.gov/tax/swiss-bank-program [Accessed 2 October 2018];US Tax Program, “Swiss banks-penalty-statistics”, available at:www.ustaxprogram.com/penalty-statistics/ [Accessed 2 October 2018]; and, for detailsabout non-prosecution agreements and penalties, United States Department of Justice, “Joint statement between the U.S. Department of Justice andthe Swiss Federal Department of Finance”, available at: www.justice.gov/tax/file/631356/download [Accessed 2 October 2018].17 International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, “Banking Giant HSBC Sheltered Murky Cash Linked To Dictators And Arms Dealers”, 8February 2015, available at: www.icij.org/investigations/swiss-leaks/banking-giant-hsbc-sheltered-murky-cash-linked-dictators-and-arms-dealers/[Accessed 2 October 2018].18Mark Branson, Chief Executive Officer of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, “Combating money-laundering is a duty of everybanker”, statement to the Annual Media Conference 2016, 7 April 2016.19 “Credit Suisse faces tax probes in multiple countries”, Financial Times, 31 March 2017; and “Verdacht auf Steuerhinterziehung: Steuerrazzia beideutschen UBS Kunden” in German only, Hanmdelsblatt, 27 September 2017.20Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, “Annual Report 2016”, p.19.A Human Rights Approach to Illicit Financial Flows in Switzerland 439[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors2. International commitmentsSwitzerland has committed itself to significantly reducing illicit financial and arms flows and tostrengthening the recovery and return of stolen assets by 2030, in line with target 16.4 of the SustainableDevelopment Goals. Switzerland has also endorsed the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the ThirdInternational Conference on Financing for Development, as a part of which states have committedthemselves to combating tax evasion and corruption, enhancing tax transparency and making sure that allcompanies, including multinationals, pay taxes to the governments of countries where economic activityoccurs and value is created.Switzerland has been party to the United Nations Convention against Corruption since 2009 and to theConvention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions ofthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) since 2000. Furthermore, thecountry is actively participating in the Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting of OECD,participates in the automatic exchange of tax information (AEOI) between countries to fight tax evasionand tax avoidance at the international level, and is also a member of the Financial Action Task Force(FATF).Switzerland underwent several Financial Action Task Force peer reviews analysing the level ofcompliance of its anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorist financing system and policies. Accordingto the Task Force’s latest mutual evaluation report in 2016, the Swiss anti-money-laundering regime istechnically robust and has achieved good results, but would benefit from some improvements in order tobe fully effective. In the report, it was found that the Swiss financial system was exposed to a high riskof laundering of assets derived from offences that had mostly been committed abroad. In its report, theTask Force welcomed several legislative measures that strengthened the Swiss anti-money-launderingframework but recommended that sanctions for money-laundering be made sufficiently dissuasive. TheTask Force concluded that the country was compliant with six recommendations, largely compliant with25 and partly compliant with nine.21 Switzerland is currently taking steps to address some of the deficienciesidentified in the report.223. Legal frameworkMeasures to avoid the entry of illicit funds into the country are central to an effective anti-money-launderingstrategy. The Federal Act on Combating Money-Laundering and Terrorist Financing(Anti-Money-Laundering Act) provides the legal basis for efforts to combat the laundering of assetsderived from corruption, aggravated tax offences or other felonies.The Act sets out specific due diligence obligations for financial intermediaries, in particular with regardto dealing with politically exposed persons, in order to prevent “dirty money” deposits in Swiss accounts.Banks also have a duty to verify the identity of their customers and determine the beneficial owners ofthe assets held in their accounts.23 They are required to re-evaluate the terms and, potentially, the continuityof their business relationship with politically exposed persons over time. Moreover, if a transaction raisesany doubts, financial intermediaries are expected to take proactivemeasures and alert theMoney-LaunderingReporting Office of Switzerland to investigate the transaction.Banking secrecy (art.47 of the Federal Act on Banks and Saving Banks) is not absolute.When suspicioustransactions are reported in good faith,24 the ban on revealing secret information shared in the context of21 Financial Action Task Force, Anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures—Switzerland, fourth round mutual evaluationreport (Paris, 2016), p.11, available at: www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/content/images/mer-switzerland-2016.pdf [Accessed 2 October 2018].22 Federal Council, “Federal Council defines thrust of follow-up work on FATF mutual evaluation report on Switzerland”, 28 June 2017, availableat: www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases/media-releases-federal-council.msg-id-67338.html [Accessed 2 October 2018].23 Federal Act on Combating Money-Laundering and Terrorist Financing art.3.24 Federal Act on Combating Money-Laundering and Terrorist Financing art.11.440 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsa professional or business relationship does not apply. Financial intermediaries have a duty to reportsuspicious transactions to the authorities where the possibility that the assets are of criminal origin cannotbe excluded. However, the distinction between mandatory and voluntary reporting by financialintermediaries leaves room for underreporting of questionable transactions.Changes to Swiss criminal provisions may have improved the reporting of suspicious transactions bybanks. On 1 January 2016, art.305 bis (1) of the Swiss Criminal Code entered into force. The articleprovides that any person who carries out an act that is aimed at frustrating the identification of the origin,the tracing or the forfeiture of assets which he or she knows or must assume originate from a felony oraggravated tax misdemeanour is liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or to a monetarypenalty. However, laundering assets derived from an aggravated tax misdemeanour is only a criminaloffence in Switzerland if the tax evaded in any tax period exceeds SwF 300,000. In other words, bankemployees may only incur criminal liability for money-laundering if they should have good reason tosuspect that they are assisting a wealthy client in committing a serious tax offence.25 Such high thresholdsdo not exist for assisting in the evasion of federal, cantonal or communal taxes, which can be punishedin Switzerland by a fine of up to SwF 10,000, and, in more serious cases, by a fine of up to SwF 50,000.26While such provisions may encourage enhanced due diligence regarding high-net- worth clients, theymay be insufficient to prevent money-laundering or the facilitation of tax evasion within the Swiss bankingsector. First, the SwF 300,000 threshold is rather high. Second, Swiss prosecution authorities often facedifficulties when assessing whether the evaded tax exceeds the specified amount, as this requires knowledgeof the tax law of various foreign jurisdictions. Third, Swiss law only penalises tax fraud as defined in arts59(1) and 186 respectively of the Federal Act on the Harmonization of Direct Taxation at the Cantonaland Communal Levels of 14 December 1990 and the Federal Act on Direct Federal Taxation. The term“tax fraud” does not cover all forms of tax evasion, as it requires the falsification of documents. Lastly,the fines for assisting tax evasion are low and may not be sufficient to discourage such behaviour.Although it may be too early to assess the impact of art.305 bis (1), prosecutors have indicated thatthey were not aware of any criminal investigation launched under that provision. In addition, the SwissFinancial Intelligence Unit has not received many reports of suspicious transactions related to tax fraud.This can be partly explained by the fact that Swiss banks have pushed their clients to regularise theirdeposits or have terminated business relationships with suspicious clients.4. Automatic exchange of information for tax purposesOn 1 January 2017, the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which allowsfor automatic, spontaneous exchange of tax information as well as exchange of information on request,entered into effect in Switzerland. On the same date, the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement onAutomatic Exchange of Financial Account Information entered into force in Switzerland.The introduction of the automatic exchange of information for tax purposes is an important step in thefight against tax evasion. It will hamper foreign nationals from participating jurisdictions in their effortsto hide undeclared assets in Swiss bank accounts. Swiss residents who have moved assets abroad in orderto evade Swiss taxes are similarly affected, as the Swiss tax administration will receive bank accountinformation related to them for assets held abroad. However, jurisdictions participating in the systemmusthave well-functioning and independent tax enforcement authorities that can use the data exchanged andenforce compliance with tax obligations.It is remarkable that Switzerland has started, as of 1 January 2017, along with 38 other jurisdictions,the automatic exchange of information for tax purposes. The automatic exchange of information standard25Criminal Code.26 Federal Act on the Harmonization of Direct Federal Taxation at the Cantonal and Communal Levels of 14 December 1990 art.56(3) and FederalAct on Direct Federal Taxation of 14 December 1990 art.177.A Human Rights Approach to Illicit Financial Flows in Switzerland 441[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsrequires Switzerland to provide financial account information related to accounts held with Swiss financialinstitutions by tax residents in foreign jurisdictions to the states concerned once a year. In return, Switzerlandreceives information from participating jurisdictions about accounts held abroad by Swiss residents. On1 January 2018, Switzerland introduced the automatic exchange of information with 40 further jurisdictions,with a first exchange of information planned for autumn 2019.27The automatic exchange of information system may not be an effective tool for curbing tax evasion indeveloping countries that do not meet the technical requirements for participation therein. Like otherdeveloped countries, Switzerland should consider expanding the number of developing countriesparticipating in the new global standard by providing technical assistance and allowing low-incomecountries to gradually implement the provision of taxation information. Switzerland can build upon itsexpertise acquired in development cooperation projects aimed at strengthening national tax administrationsand has, since 2015, been providing technical assistance in the context of the Global Forum on Transparencyand Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, and participates in the African Tax Administration Forum,which supports capacity-building in African states. The participation of developed and developing countriesis crucial to efforts to enhance transparency and international tax cooperation at the global level.The stringent requirements set by OECD in terms of confidentiality and data management remaindifficult for some countries to meet, although such standards are important in protecting the right to privacy.Information provided to foreign tax authorities could potentially be misused for purposes other than theinvestigation of tax offences. In some countries, human rights defenders and opponents of governmentshave been prosecuted for alleged tax offences in a rather suspicious or selective way, suggesting thatprosecution is motivated less by a desire to ensure tax justice than by the wish to obstruct their legitimateactivities and reduce civic space.OECD requires full reciprocity from its counterparts when entering into data-exchange agreements,which implies a certain level of administrative and technical capacity and infrastructure. A number ofdeveloping countries have difficulties meeting such requirements.Switzerland is also active in the field of exchange of tax information on request with more than 100jurisdictions, including several developing countries, based on double-taxation agreements,tax-information-exchange agreements and the Federal Act on International Administrative Assistance inTax Matters.III. Reducing corporate tax abuse and harmful tax competitionSwitzerland has also begun implementing various measures to avoid profit shifting by multinationalcorporations, such as action 13 of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project of the OECD. The aim isto ensure that corporate tax revenues are paid where real economic activities are taking place, labour isperformed and profits are made. Switzerlandmight consider requiring multinational enterprises to publiclyreport, on a country-by-country basis, the taxes they have paid, as non-public reporting is insufficient toensure tax transparency by transnational corporations.In 2016, the government presented the Swiss electorate with a comprehensive corporate tax reformpackage, which included measures to bring Swiss corporate tax regimes into line with OECD standardsin order to combat base erosion and profit shifting by multinational companies. The new law would haveoutlawed certain tax reduction regimes that are no longer accepted internationally, replacing them withpatent box regimes and other avenues for tax reduction and profit shifting from abroad.In February 2017, the proposal put forward by the government and the Parliament of Switzerland didnot garner majority support in a public referendum. In September 2017, the Federal Council published a27 See https://www.efd.admin.ch/efd/en/home/themen/wirtschaft--waehrung--finanzplatz/finanzmarktpolitik/automatic-exchange-of-information--aeoi-.html [Accessed 2 October 2018].442 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsrevised “tax proposal 17” for public consultation, with the aim of ensuring the compliance of Swisscorporate tax regimes with OECD standards.28Attention to the potential human rights impact of the revisedtax reform in foreign countries needs to be paid. Essentially, “tax proposal 17” aims to keep taxation formultinational corporations and other businesses at low levels to attract businesses to and persuade themto establish their headquarters in Switzerland. Attracting businesses may well bring benefits for the countryin the form of tax receipts and employment opportunities. However, excessive tax competition betweencountries is harmful, as it has resulted in the dramatic reduction of corporate tax payments by largecorporations worldwide and contributed to the reduction of public revenues for investment and the risein unsustainable public debt in many countries, especially in the developing world.Importantly, the reduction of corporate tax rates for businesses or tax exemptions for transnationalcorporations should not undermine the ability of federal, cantonal or local government institutions inSwitzerland to meet their human rights obligations, in particular in the fields of education, social security,health and culture. Nor should corporate tax reforms result in a shifting of tax burdens from businessesto low- or middle-income households.Low tax regimes provide incentives for profit shifting and result in reduced tax revenues in thosecountries where most of the real business takes place, thus shrinking the fiscal space of states to fulfiltheir human rights obligations. This is why the Swiss government, at the federal, cantonal and local levelsshould be called upon, to carry out a social and human rights impact assessment of the tax reform package,which should include an assessment of the impact of the package on tax revenues available for the realisationof economic and social rights within Switzerland and abroad, in particular in developing countries.29In this context, It should be recalled that art.141(a) and (g) of the Federal Act on the Federal Assemblyrequires the government to submit assessments on the impacts of draft laws on the economy, society,environment and future generations and assess their compliance with fundamental rights and bindinginternational law. A recent Swiss Federal Audit Office report indicated, however, that only one-third ofall Federal Council dispatches met the minimum requirements regarding the assessment of impact onsociety and the environment.30Unfortunately, the information available on “tax proposal 17” does not include a detailed assessmentof the nature of the reform package’s impact on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights inSwitzerland and abroad.IV. Institutional framework for tracing stolen assets and curbingmoney- launderingIt is of paramount importance that the state play a balanced and nuanced role in ensuring accountability,transparency and fairness in the financial sector when dealing with human rights abuses and illicit financialflows. The supervision of Swiss banks through self-regulatory norms set by the Swiss Bankers Associationand regulation by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority are therefore crucial.The staffing, resources and powers of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority need to beproportional to the size of the Swiss financial market and the volume of assets managed by its financialinstitutions. The Authority should have sufficient capacity to supervise all banks and financial intermediariesadequately, irrespective of their size.Investigations of recent cases show that, although the majority of banks fulfilled their duties under theFederal Act on Combating Money-Laundering and Terrorist Financing, a minority had failed to do so. Inthe Petrobras case, for instance, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority revealed that 75 per28 Federal Council, “Federal Council initiates consultation on tax proposal 17”, 6 September 2017, available at: www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-68007.html [Accessed 20 October 2018].29 For the principles that should inform such assessments, see A/HRC/37/54.30Swiss Federal Audit Office,Prognosen in den Botschaften des Bundesrates: Evaluation der prospektiven Folgenabschätzungen von Gesetzentwürfenin German only (Bern, 2016), available at: https://biblio.parlament.ch/e-docs/389085.pdf [Accessed 13 September 2018].A Human Rights Approach to Illicit Financial Flows in Switzerland 443[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorscent of the approximately 20 Swiss banks involved applied money-laundering rules in conformity withthe Swiss legal regime. However, the Authority noted that, with regard to the remaining 25 per cent ofbanks, there were concrete indications that the anti-money-laundering measures they had in place wereinadequate.31 The Authority has dissolved one bank, withdrawn the fiduciary licences of a number ofcompanies and ordered the disgorgement of illegally generated profits in the context of enforcement.The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority published in 2011 an investigation into the duediligence obligations of Swiss banks handling assets of politically exposed persons, indicating that it hadinitiated administrative proceedings against four out of the 20 banks audited. The names of those fourbanks, with regard to which serious gaps were found, were not made public. Hence, the general publichas been left to wonder which banks had serious flaws in their due diligence procedures or carried outclarifications solely with a view to safeguarding the bank’s own reputation, with little consideration beinggiven to the risk of money-laundering.32 Neither is there any information available as to whether sanctionswere imposed and, if so, on which financial institutions.It is also commendable the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority for publishing, since 2014,annual enforcement reports33 and for recently issuing press statements indicating measures taken againstparticular financial institutions in the most egregious cases of non-compliance. However, the enforcementreports do not name the financial institutions subjected to sanctions. The purpose of enforcement is toavoid repetition of infringements and ensure individual corporate accountability for non-compliance withbanking regulations.Financial intermediaries are required to submit information about suspicious transactions to theMoney-Laundering Reporting Office of Switzerland. After gathering information on the origin of theassets or on suspect persons, the Office may forward it to prosecutors for potential action. In 2016, theOffice received 2,909 suspicious transaction reports related to financial transactions of a total value ofSwF 5.32 billion. Currently, most suspicious transaction reports are received from banks, with only a verysmall number of fiduciaries reporting suspicious transaction to the Office. After review, in 2016, 71.3 percent of all cases were forwarded to the judicial authorities.341. ProsecutionThe Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland and cantonal prosecutors have specialised units forfinancial crimes and crimes related to money-laundering. Complex, large-scale investigations have beenconducted at both the federal and cantonal levels, including cases involving predicate offences committedoutside Switzerland.In 2016, prosecution authorities and courts received 766 suspicious transaction reports from theMoney-Laundering Reporting Office of Switzerland. In about half of all cases, the proceedings weredismissed, 108 cases resulted in the issuing of a judgment by a court and only 3 per cent resulted in theacquittal of the defendant.35 In addition, criminal investigations into money-laundering cases can be openedby the federal and cantonal prosecution authorities in response to requests for mutual legal assistance,police reports, complaints filed by members of the public and reports from other federal and cantonalauthorities. In total, every year between 200 and 300 cases result in convictions.3631Mark Branson, Chief Executive Officer of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, “Combating money-laundering is a duty of everybanker”, statement to the Annual Media Conference 2016, 7 April 2016.32 See Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, “Due diligence obligations of Swiss banks when handling assets of ‘politically exposedpersons’. An investigation by FINMA”, 28 October 2011, p.9.33 See www.finma.ch/en/documentation/finma-publications/reports/enforcement-reports/ [Accessed 2 October 2018].34 Federal Office of Police,MROS 19th Annual Report: 2016 (Bern, 2017), section 2(2)(4).35 Federal Office of Police,MROS 19th Annual Report: 2016 (Bern, 2017), p.14.36 Financial Action Task Force, Anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures—Switzerland, fourth round mutual evaluationreport (Paris, 2016), table 10.444 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe Swiss authorities have successfully identified and dismantled several sophisticatedmoney-launderingnetworks. In the 1MDB and Petrobras cases, the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland initiateddozens of proceedings in which the alleged offence was large-scale corruption resulting in losses amountingto the equivalent of hundreds of millions, if not billions of Swiss francs for Malaysia and Brazil.37 In the1MDB case, assets intended for the economic and social development of Malaysia estimated to be as highas several billion dollars had been transferred to Swiss accounts held by former officials of Malaysia andthe United Arab Emirates.38In some instances, national efforts to ensure accountability for economic crimes committed in multiplejurisdictions can be undermined if a mechanism for genuine international cooperation is not in place. TheSwiss authorities have, in the past, faced difficulties in ensuring accountability where efforts to bring asuccessful prosecution domestically depended on the political will of foreign authorities to prosecute theunderlying criminal acts committed in their jurisdictions.2. Freezing, confiscation and repatriation of stolen assetsSwitzerland has demonstrated an increasing willingness to freeze and confiscate stolen assets. The firstcase involved the freezing of several million Swiss francs related to former Philippine ruler FerdinandMarcos when he was forced into exile in 1986. Other prominent cases include Sani Abacha, of Nigeria,Mobutu Sese Seko, of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Vladimiro Montesinos, of Peru, andJean-Claude Duvalier, of Haiti. In January 2011, Switzerland swiftly froze accounts belonging to formerpresidents of Egypt and Tunisia and their entourages and, in February 2014, assets belonging to a formerpresident of Ukraine. Switzerland has also frozen the assets of politically exposed persons from Libyaand the Syrian Arab Republic in the context of international sanctions. In total, over the past 30 years,Switzerland has returned about $2 billion of illicit assets to their countries of origin.39The freezing of large assets held by corrupt and human rights abusing leaders has, however, raisedquestions about why Swiss financial institutions managed such assets for many years without alerting theauthorities as to their suspicious nature or carrying out due investigations. Allegations that those leaderswere involved in corruption or responsible for human rights violations were circulating widely when theywere still in power.In 2011, Switzerland adopted a law aimed at facilitating the freezing and return of stolen assets ofpolitically exposed persons and their entourages. In 2014, the country further refined its policies byadopting a comprehensive strategy on freezing, confiscating and returning the illicitly acquired assets ofpolitically exposed persons, which included preventive and repressive measures.40The Swiss legal framework was further strengthened by the revision, in December 2015, of the ForeignIllicit Assets Act. The Act provides for the freezing of assets when the country of origin is unable to satisfythe requirements for mutual legal assistance owing to the total or substantial collapse, or the impairment,of its judicial system. In such circumstances, the Act provides for the seizure of assets on the reasonablepresumption that they must have been acquired by illicit means, thus reversing the burden of proof. TheAct specifies that the aim of the restitution of assets is to strengthen the rule of law and to improve theliving conditions of the inhabitants of the country of origin.37 Financial Action Task Force, Anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures—Switzerland, fourth round mutual evaluationreport (Paris, 2016), para.183.38 Federal Office of Justice, Annual activity report 2016: mutual legal assistance, p.14.39 Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, “No dirty money: the Swiss experience in returning illicit assets”, available at: www.eda.admin.ch/dam/eda/en/documents/aussenpolitik/voelkerrecht/edas-broschuere-no-dirty-money_EN.pdf [Accessed 2 October 2018].40Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, “Stratégie de la Suisse concernant le blocage, la confiscation et la restitution des avoirs de potentats (‘AssetRecovery’)”, in French only, available at: www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/eda/fr/documents/aussenpolitik/finanzplatz-wirtschaft/Strategie-Schweiz-Sperrung-Einziehung-Rueckfuehrung-Potentatengelder_FR.pdf [Accessed 2 October 2018].A Human Rights Approach to Illicit Financial Flows in Switzerland 445[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsHowever, according to art.3(2)(a) of the Foreign Illicit Assets Act, assets can only be frozen if thegovernment or certain members of the government of the country of origin have lost power, or a changein power appears inevitable. In other words, under this Act, Switzerland cannot freeze the assets ofpolitically exposed persons while they are still firmly in power, unless such an action is carried out on thebasis of an international sanctions regime or in the, highly unlikely, event that a request for mutual legalassistance in criminal matters is received from the country of origin while the leader in question is still inpower.Adequate strategies need to be developed at the international and national levels to reduce the risk offinancial support and services strengthening leaders involved in criminal conduct and resulting in thecontinued perpetration of serious human rights violations. Regrettably, compared to measures in place toprevent the financing of terrorism, international standards to prevent the provision of financial servicesto states and individuals responsible for serious violations of human rights remain underdeveloped.41The Swiss authorities have encountered challenges concerning judicial confiscation. For instance,under Swiss criminal law, prosecutors are required to provide evidence that any assets frozen relate to acrime. Thus, proving that there is a link between a given crime and the assets frozen is usually key toensuring the seizure, confiscation and return of stolen assets. Assets can only be seized from a politicallyexposed person or his or her entourage based on presumption of their illicit origin in situations coveredby the Foreign Illicit Assets Act. Certain narrowly defined conditions must be fulfilled: the country oforigin must be unable to engage in mutual legal assistance owing to the total or substantial collapse, orimpairment, of its judicial system; the wealth of the asset holder must have increased inordinately, facilitatedby the exercise of a public function; and there must have been notoriously high levels of corruption duringhis or her term of office.42In all other situations, when asset recovery proceeds on the basis of mutual legal assistance, the Swissauthorities seize assets pursuant to a mutual legal assistance request if the condition of dual criminality ismet, and provide the requesting state with evidence enabling the courts of the requesting state to orderthe confiscation of the assets frozen in Switzerland. Based on the confiscation decision in the requestingstate, the frozen assets are then returned to the requesting state. However, theMoney-Laundering ReportingOffice of Switzerland reports that the chances of obtaining information from abroad vary depending onthe foreign country in question.43 In addition, due process standards in Switzerland allow holders ofaccounts containing stolen assets to challenge freezing and expropriation decisions. As highlighted by theEuropean Court of Human Rights a number of times, while due process is very important from a humanrights point of view (even more important than UN Security Council resolutions),44 adequate measuresshould be taken to ensure that judicial guarantees do not result in stolen assets only being returned afterextremely lengthy legal procedures before the Swiss courts.Efforts to return stolen assets to Egypt illustrate the difficulties in this regard. On the same day thatformer President Hosni Mubarak was ousted, the Swiss Federal Council issued an order freezing all hisassets and those of his entourage. Subsequently, close to $700 million of assets were frozen. Criminalprosecutions were launched in Egypt and Switzerland. However, in December 2016, after several yearsof investigations, the Attorney General of Switzerland announced that he would drop criminal proceedingsagainst several persons and order the unblocking of SwF 180 million. Following an analysis of Egyptiancourt decisions by the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, it was concluded that it was unlikelythat a link could be established between the funds in question and a crime committed in Egypt.4541 For a more detailed analysis, see A/HRC/28/59.42 Foreign Illicit Assets Act arts 4 and 15.43 See Federal Office of Police,MROS 19th Annual Report: 2016 (Bern: Federal Office of Police, 2017), section 2(2)(6).44Al-Dulimi and Montana Management Inc v Switzerland (App. No.5809/08), judgment of 21 June 2013; Nada v Switzerland (App. No.10593/08),judgment of 12 September 2012.45 Federal Council, “Arab Spring: Attorney General meets Egyptian authorities in Cairo”, 17 December 2016, available at: www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-64958.html [Accessed 2 October 2018].446 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsIn December 2017, the Federal Council decided to unfreeze the remaining assets from Egypt withimmediate effect, given that the Egyptian courts had dropped all relevant criminal proceedings withpossible links to Switzerland.46 The assets have only remained blocked because criminal procedures inSwitzerland are still ongoing. The result is rather unfortunate. Despite more than five years of investigationsand regular exchanges between the Swiss and Egyptian authorities, it appears unlikely that the assetsfrozen in Switzerland will be returned to Egypt for the benefit of the local population.The innovative Foreign Illicit Assets Act was of no assistance in this case. The Swiss authoritiesmaintained that Egypt was not a failed state without a functioning judicial system. Therefore, asset recoveryefforts took place exclusively on the basis of mutual legal assistance requests. However, the Swissauthorities could not continue to block assets indefinitely, without sufficient proof that they had beenacquired by irregular means.It is therefore necessary to strengthen the Swiss legal framework for asset recovery by reversing theburden of proof to the extent permitted by international human rights standards. The Swiss authoritiesshould be empowered to seize assets from politically exposed persons where there are well-foundedreasons to believe that those assets derive from corruption or other criminal conduct. In such cases, theonus should be on the corresponding account holder to demonstrate that all assets held by him or her havebeen acquired by legitimate means.The Swiss authorities have also occasionally faced difficulties in guaranteeing that assets returned areused for the benefit of the population, as required by the Foreign Illicit Assets Act. The authorities havelearned from past cases and have taken measures to prevent returned funds from being misappropriatedagain.47It needs to be recalled that participation and transparency are core human rights principles that shouldguide the restitution of stolen assets, as stated in the principles for disposition and transfer of confiscatedstolen assets in corruption cases welcomed at the Global Forum on Asset Recovery held in WashingtonDC from 4 to 6 December 2017.48 It is important that stolen funds are returned to their legitimate ownersin a timely manner, that the owners of those funds have a say in their final use and that there is fulltransparency and accountability regarding the use of the funds after their return.Many countries from which assets have been stolen are going through transitional periods, dealingwith past atrocities. When the regulatory authorities or criminal courts find that financial intermediarieshave failed to exercise the required due diligence when receiving or managing returned funds, humanrights victims of the country concerned need and deserve an explicit public apology from the respectivefinancial institutions and compensation. Such an approach constitutes an important step in rebuilding trustin the context of transitional justice and may often be as important as the actual return of the stolen assets.V. Conclusions and recommendations for discussionSwitzerland has adopted a human rights policy aimed at coherence and the promotion and protection ofhuman rights at home and abroad.49 This implies a great challenge, in particular in the financial field. Inorder to enhance financial and fiscal transparency around the world, national and international actionsand effective coordination and cooperation between states are essential.46 Swissinfo, “Freeze of foreign assets in Swiss banks extended”, 20 December 2017, available at: www.swissinfo.ch/eng/tunisia--egypt--ukraine_freeze-of-foreign-assets-in-swiss-banks-extended/43770116 [Accessed 2 October 2018].47See Federal Council, “Memorandum of Understanding among the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Swiss Federal Council andthe International Development Association on the return, monitoring and management of illegally acquired assets confiscated by Switzerland to berestituted to the Federal Republic of Nigeria”, 4 December 2017, available at: www.newsd.admin.ch/newsd/message/attachments/50734.pdf [Accessed2 October 2018].48Global Forum on Asset Recovery, Communiqué, available at: star.worldbank.org/star/sites/star/files/20171206_gfar_communique.pdf [Accessed2 October 2018].49 Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, Human Rights Strategy 2016–2019.A Human Rights Approach to Illicit Financial Flows in Switzerland 447[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsIn recent years, through a number of efforts, the Federal Council has achieved progress in curbingillicit financial flows that undermine the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights in Switzerlandand in other jurisdictions. The fact that the Government of Switzerland expects all businesses based inSwitzerland, including public and private financial institutions, to respect human rights wherever theyoperate should be welcomed. As a part of this stance, businesses and financial institutions are also requiredto exercise human rights due diligence throughout their business and client relationships.Switzerland can play a key role in curbing illicit financial flows and become a front-runner in integratinghuman rights into the public and private financial sectors. This article has identified good practices thatother financial centres could follow but also indicates areas where there is room for improvement. Forinstance, measures could be taken to strengthen the accountability, regulation and supervision of the Swissfinancial market to prevent adverse human rights impacts caused by illicit financial flows.Human rights considerations should be systematically integrated into the financial policies of publicand private institutions based in Switzerland. First, ensuring human rights due diligence is a legal obligationunder international human rights standards.50 Second, further embedding human rights in financial policywould enhance the reputation of the Swiss financial sector, strengthen the credibility of the sector’s humanrights policies and help to make the Swiss financial market a leader in sustainable finance. Lastly, andmost importantly, such amove would improve the protection and enjoyment of human rights in Switzerlandand abroad.Integrating human rights due diligence into the financial regulatory field should be considered anevolving duty, given that the asymmetric power relations undermining human rights and underlying theoperations of financial markets need to be continuously addressed.In the light of these conclusions,a number of recommendations recently made to the government andpublic institutions in Switzerland, as well public and private financial institutions operating in the countryare presented for discussion. They were part of a mission report discussed with the Swiss government atthe UN Human Rights Council during its session on 28 March 2018.51First, regarding the government and public institutions in Switzerland, it is crucial to take further stepsto prevent the undetected entry of illicit financial flows into the Swiss financial market, as well as ensurethat banks and financial intermediaries exercise sufficient due diligence with clients, in particular politicallyexposed persons and high-net-worth individuals, and assess the effectiveness of the existing regulatoryframework. There should also be introduced sufficiently dissuasive, proportionate and effective sanctionsfor financial institutions and their employees who fail to exercise due diligence or assist in tax evasion ormoney-laundering.Another proposal is to reduce significantly the SwF 300,000 threshold for the amount of tax that mustbe evaded within one year before criminal responsibility is incurred for money-laundering when assistinga foreigner in tax fraud. The offence should also cover all forms of tax evasion and should not be limitedto tax fraud.It is important to continue efforts to encourage all financial intermediaries to systematically submitsuspicious transaction reports to the Money-Laundering Reporting Office of Switzerland and to expandthe Office’s power so that, in the absence of a suspicious transaction report in Switzerland, it can obtaininformation in the possession of financial intermediaries from its foreign counterparts. It is equally relevantto expand the number of developing countries participating in the automatic exchange of information ontaxation matters by further increasing technical assistance and allowing low-income countries to graduallymeet requirements relating to the exchange of taxation information.50Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No.24; Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; and GuidingPrinciples on Foreign Debt and Human Rights.51A/HRC/37/54/Add.3.448 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsAs envisaged, Switzerland needs to bring corporate tax regimes into conformity with OECD standardsby abolishing tax-reduction schemes that facilitate profit shifting by transnational corporations, withoutreplacing those schemes with new avenues for tax reduction; and continue to support measures at theinternational level to reduce harmful tax competition between countries.What is clearly missing is to carry out a human rights impact assessment of the proposed corporate taxreform, in particular its impact on revenues available for the realisation of economic and social rightswithin Switzerland and in developing countries.There is a need to increase the staff, resources and powers of the Swiss Financial Market SupervisoryAuthority in proportion to the size of the Swiss financial market and the volume of assets managed by itsfinancial institutions, to ensure that the Authority has sufficient capacity to supervise all financialintermediaries adequately and irrespective of their size.It would be important to publicly identify financial institutions that have been subjected to sanctionsor corrective action, to ensure individual corporate accountability for non-compliance with bankingregulations. Also crucialis to ensure that stolen assets derived from corruption, misappropriation of publicfunds and other criminal conduct can be seized by the Swiss authorities when mutual legal assistance ispossible, but unsuccessful, because criminal prosecutions fail to take place in foreign jurisdictions or donot meet international due process standards. It should be possible to seize such assets where the holderhas failed to demonstrate that they are derived from legitimate economic activities.Revising the Foreign Illicit Assets Act to allow for the freezing and confiscation of assets derived fromcorruption or other criminal conduct by politically exposed persons while they are still in power, andensure that stolen funds are returned to their rightful owners in a timely manner; that the owners of thosefunds have a say in their final use and that there is full transparency and accountability regarding thefunds’ use after they are returned should also be considered.Regarding public and private financial institutions specifically operating in Switzerland, they need toenhance their reporting of suspicious transactions related to corruption, money-laundering or tax evasionto the Money-Laundering Reporting Office of Switzerland, as well as ensure that assets managed by themare not invested in businesses or provided to state actors responsible for corruption, tax evasion or violationsof human rights or international labour standards.Finally, they need to adopt policies to prevent the provision of financial services or support to individuals,companies or states responsible for gross violations of human rights; and implement the Guiding Principleson Business and Human Rights and the Guiding Principles on Foreign Debt and Human Rights.A Human Rights Approach to Illicit Financial Flows in Switzerland 449[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsRevisiting Union Citizenship from a FundamentalRights Perspective in the Time of BrexitVolker RoebenPetra MinneropPedro TellesJukka Snell*Brexit; Citizenship; EU nationals; Fundamental rights; Human rightsAbstractThe aim of this article is to offer a fundamental rights reading of Union citizenship at a time whereindividual life choices based on the assumed certainty of Union citizenship and the right to free movementare put in jeopardy. The withdrawal of a Member State from the EU serves as a prism through which torevisit the conception of Union citizenship. The article starts by providing a close analysis of the evolvingcase-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the Court) on that citizenship. The article thenhighlights the potential of a normative, fundamental rights approach to Union citizenship that includesindividuals in the EU legal order and protects them against exclusion through the removal of thatfundamental right. That allows a coherent interpretation of the recent case-law on citizenship, the Charterof Fundamental Rights of the EU and the general principles of Union law as derived from constitutionaltraditions of the Member States and international law. If Union citizenship is understood as such afundamental rights-based concept, then the intrinsic connection between being a Union citizen and anational of aMember State of the Union competes with the protection of Union citizenship as a fundamentalright that is conferred on each individual. Union citizenship is not just an objective status that states canconfer and remove.IntroductionThis article enters new territory with the claim that primary law enshrines an individualistic fundamentalrights-based conception of Union citizenship. The article offers an analysis of the material trend in therecent jurisprudence of the Court that, together with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and theconstitutional traditions of the Member States, can be coherently explained with the conception of Unioncitizenship as a fundamental right. The argument proceeds in three steps.It first demonstrates that Union citizenship is not simply a Treaty-conferred dispositive status, but thatexisting primary and secondary law limits the disposition on citizenship and the rights that come with it.*Professor Volker Roeben, University of Dundee; Dr Petra Minnerop, University of Dundee; Dr Pedro Telles, Swansea University; Professor JukkaSnell, University of Turku. The article builds on and develops the arguments put forward by the authors in the study “The Feasibility of Associate EUCitizenship for UKCitizens post-Brexit” (July 2017), undertaken for Ms Jill Evans, MEP and Keith Bush QC. Earlier drafts of the article were presentedat the European Parliament and at workshops at the universities of Turku, Swansea and Dundee. The authors wish to thank participants for theirengagement and comments, in particular Judge Alan Rosas, Professor Dimitry Kochenov, Professor Stijn Smismans, and Professor Catherine Barnard,and they are grateful for the incisive comments by an anonymous reviewer.[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors450The case-law of the CJEU highlights a tendency towards Union citizenship as a fundamental right thatcannot be taken away by aMember State, either through the decision of a state authority or the collectivityof the people of a state, or by the EU itself. To this end, the recent case-law of the Court on Unioncitizenship protecting the individual against exclusion will be examined closely. Part I analyses the recentjurisprudence of the Court concerning Union citizenship in the citizen–state relationship and in thestate–state relationship, with the focus on the protection of Union citizens against physical exclusion fromUnion territory, i.e. measures of expulsion or extradition that are obstacles to free movement. This isfollowed by close scrutiny of the case-law for protection of Union citizens against legal exclusion throughloss of their citizenship.The article then adopts in Part II the normative perspective of Union citizenship as a fundamental right.This section concludes with framing a normativity of Union citizenship as a fundamental right which theanalysis supports. The conception of Union citizenship has attracted much debate in the literature. It hasbeen proposed to differentiate on the basis of the function of citizenship between market citizenship, socialcitizenship, or republican citizenship.1 Closely related is the question whether Union citizenship is a suigeneris concept, categorically different from the concept that has formed within the nation state.2 ProfessorBarnardmakes the case that all citizenship operates the distinction between inclusion of some and exclusionof others.3 Others have focused on the rationale of each Union citizenship right.4 This section argues fora conception of Union citizenship rooted in the normativity of a fundamental right. In examining the EUCharter of Fundamental Rights, the constitutional traditions of the Member States and international law,the analysis arrives at a normative turning point. The normativity of Union citizenship as a fundamentalright will not only capture the analysis but also prevent a sharp decline in the protection of Union citizensin case of the withdrawal of a Member State from the Union. From there, it will be demonstrated thatprotection against removal of Union citizenship is the logical consequence.The article turns in Part III to three counterarguments that have been raised or could potentially beraised. The first concerns a purported categorical difference between citizenship in the state and in theEU. The second counterargument is that art.20(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union(TFEU) inseparably and permanently connects Union citizenship with EU membership of the state ofnationality. The third counterargument is the claim that art.50(1) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU)permits the collective decision of a state to withdraw from the EU, thereby removing citizenships andrelated rights.The article explores the implications of this fundamental rights-based conception of Union citizenshipby reference to the departure of a Member State from the EU. With the withdrawal of the UK from theUnion pursuant to art.50 of the TEU becoming effective by default in March 2019, the Treaties will ceaseto apply between the UK and the remaining Member States. Brexit thus amounts to a fundamental testfor a still new legal institution of supranational citizenship: it challenges the very viability of Unioncitizenship as a concept that has, just as citizenship in Member States, at its core the individual’s claim toprotection. More radically, the second and third part of the article make the case that since citizenshiprights and Union citizenship as such are fundamental rights, they can survive the UK’s withdrawal fromthe EU. The most obvious argument against this proposition is that citizenship rights derive from the EUTreaties, so if those Treaties cease to bind then the rights must disappear as well. The Treaties could conferindividual rights that are powerful and far-reaching, yet that alone would not explain in itself what happenswhen the instrument from which they originate is removed. However, if Union citizenship is seen as a1Dimitry Kochenov, “The Essence of EU Citizenship Emerging from the Last Ten Years of Academic Debate: Beyond the Cherry Blossoms andthe Moon?” (2013) 62 Int’l Comp L. Q. 97; Catherine Barnard, The Substantive Law of the European Union (5th edn, Oxford University Press, 2016),p.325, with references in fn.40.2Barnard, The Substantive Law of the European Union (2016), p 325.3Barnard, The Substantive Law of the European Union (2016), p 326.4Daniel Thym, “The Elusive Limits of Solidarity.

That normativity sustains citizenshippost-exit of the state. In the political discussion at least, it is by far more difficult to argue that Unioncitizenship is similar to being a citizen in the Member State than that citizenship in a state is conceptuallydifferent from citizenship in the Union, even if that means arguing for an understanding of state sovereigntythat directly diminishes individual protection. By contrast, this article will outline a coherent conceptionof Union citizenship that has the implication that Brexit does not extinguish the Union citizenships heldby UK or EU27 nationals. Rather, current citizenships will continue as a matter of law.I. Analysing the evolution of the Court’s citizenship case-lawPursuing the aspiration to create a “Europe for citizens” dating back to the early 1970s, the 1992MaastrichtTreaty inserted a new Part Two into the EC Treaty, entitled “Citizenship of the Union”.5 The roots of thiscitizenship go even further back, with the idea of removing obstacles to free movement of workers datingback to the establishment of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation.6Developing the SingleMarket after founding a free trade area and a customs union, the conception of Union citizenship wasgreeted with the expectation that it would manifest the principle of non-discrimination and equal treatmentof workers and non-workers, and it would give back the person-quality to workers beyond theirmarket-functionality while raising the level of protection for non-workers.After revision by the 2007 Lisbon Treaty,7 Union citizenship is now contained in Title II of the Treatyon European Union (TEU) 8 and Part Two of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)9.Article 9 of the TEU and art.20(1) of the TFEU establish citizenship of the Union, held by every personholding the nationality of a Member State, while para.2 of art.20 of the TFEU lists rights that this Unioncitizenship encompasses: the right to reside in another Member State; the right to vote and stand in certainelections; diplomatic and consular protection; and the right to petition to the European Parliament and tothe European Ombudsman. These rights are provided for in more detail in arts 21–25 of the TFEU. Theright to reside in another Member State than the home state (art.21 of the TFEU) and the right to vote andstand for candidate (art.22 of the TFEU) are directly applicable individual rights.10This section demonstrates that the case-law of the Court extends citizenship law beyond the wordingin the Treaties. This case-law has established Union citizenship as the fundamental status of individuals.From that basis, it has progressively strengthened the right to reside in the EU territory to comprise theright not to be excluded through either expulsion or extradition.1. Union citizenship as fundamental status in the citizen-state relationshipIn its constant case-law since Grzelczyk,11 the Court has qualified Union citizenship, under art.20(1) ofthe TFEU, as the “fundamental status” of individuals. The deontological quality of this status, its functionand capacity to yield rights, have attracted much debate.12 The test lies in the rights that are based on thestatus, without being explicitly provided in the Treaties or the implementing legislation.

Since Singh, it recognises the right to return toone’sMember State of nationality.13 The Court includes such unwritten rights into the supporting secondarylaw on Union citizenship,14 by way of analogy, for citizens who return to their Member States of nationalityafter having exercised their free movement rights.15Starting with Ruiz-Zambrano16 and continued recently in RendónMarín17 andChavez-Vilchez the Courthas consistently concluded that citizens, who have not exercised their right of free movement and thereforedo not fall under art.21 of the TFEU, still have the right to reside where they choose in the EU territoryincluding their own Member State. In this reasoning, reference to the effectiveness of the status informsthe interpretation of the relating bundle of rights, so that beyond the wording of art.21 of the TFEU a rightto reside in and to return to one’s own Member State is recognised.18 Thus, the reasoning that underpinsthis jurisprudence merits closer attention. It invokes the “effectiveness” of the fundamental status of Unioncitizenship and the “substance” of the relating rights that is inviolable.The underlying logic of effectiveness is twofold. First, to prevent Union citizens from being deterredfrom exercising their freedom of movement rights, if on return to the home country, conditions of entryand residence are not at least equivalent to those in another Member State.19 Second, exercising freemovement rights shall not entail ex post disadvantages for Union citizens. So, not only should Unioncitizens not be discouraged from leaving their homeMember State, they should also not be ex post penalisedfor doing so.20 To put it differently, exercising freedom of movement rights should not be a risky endeavour,which it will be if Member State nationals must consider whether they will be able to return to their homestate with their family members. Even more risky is free movement if the individual citizenship isdiscontinued in case the EU membership of the state of destination comes to an end. Such uncertaintiesabout continued membership of states pose the most profound threat to exercising freedom of movementrights and while they have materialised in Brexit, they are not necessarily restricted to this one case.Going further than the Court, in Ruiz Zambrano, AG Sharpston had reasoned that “only seamlessprotection of fundamental rights under EU law in all areas of exclusive or shared EU competence matchesthe concept of EU citizenship”, yet indicating that this should be decided with the support of the MemberStates.21 The Court more narrowly decided that Member States cannot refuse the right of residence tocarers of EU citizens who are minors. However, it should be noted that all governments had submittedthat in the given circumstances, EU law would not be applicable. Consequently, the Court answered the13The Queen v Immigration Appeal Tribunal and Surinder Singh, Ex p. Secretary of State for Home Department (C-370/90) [1992] E.C.R.

In both cases, the Court found that the situation was governed bynational law and this did not interfere with the substance of either art.20 or art.21 of the TFEU.22 The Courtcannot overcome the distribution of competences between theMember States and the EU through case-law,however, this certainly requires a very clear definition of criteria to define when such a situation involvinga Union citizen can indeed be considered as purely internal. Yet the claim that Union citizenship is afundamental right does not require a jurisprudence that would transform art.20 of the TEU into a competenceprovision for the EU in purely internal situations.The reasoning underpinning the case-law indeed merges into a deeper normativity of a fundamentalright quality of Union citizenship that is rooted in the protection of an established link between theindividual and the Member State and the individual and the EU. It has already been pointed out that theCourt’s jurisprudence on Union citizenship-as-status provides the guarantee of being on the territory ofthe EU subject to its legal order. That comprises the right of a Union citizen to enter the Union territory(Baumbast),23 the right of a Union citizen to return to one’s own Member State (Singh)24 and the right ofa Union citizen to reside in one’s own Member State (Ruiz Zambrano).25 Professor Kochenov has pointedout these cases overcome the transboundary nature of a Union citizenship that applies only where a citizenhas exercised his right to move to anotherMember State.26It is protection for Union citizens facing the threat of de facto physical exclusion from the EU territorythat motivates this jurisprudence. The Court’s recent jurisprudence further shores up this protection againstphysical exclusion through the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of theEuropean Union.27 This rationale brings the fundamental right normativity to bear on protecting the familylife and, in particular, the citizen-child against expulsion. To this effect are created and progressivelyreinforced the derived residence rights of third-country carers of children having Union citizenship. TheMetock and Lounes line of cases implicitly incorporate the fundamental right of the citizen to a privateand family life enshrined in art.7 of the Charter.28 Rendón Marín now expressly activates this fundamentalright in the interpretation of art.20 of the TFEU. RendónMarín’s situation must be assessed taking accountof the right to respect for private and family life as laid down in art.7 of the Charter and for the rights ofthe citizen-child enshrined in art.24(2) of the Charter. The Court therefore narrows the public policy/securitygrounds for removing the carer.29 In Chavez, the Court connects the Treaty-based right of the Unioncitizen-child with the fundamental right of the child guaranteed in art.24(2) of the Charter.30 It also underpins22McCarthy (C-434/09), 5 May 2011 at [48], the Court made clear that as a national of a Member State, the person enjoys the status of Union Citizenunder art.20(1) of the TFEU, including in relation to the Member State of origin; Dereci (C-256/11), 15 November 2011 at [64].23Baumbast (C-413/99) [2002] E.C.R.

The Court bases the extension of protection in the situation of return to a citizen’s home country in asituation that is similar to a situation for which the law provides and thereby protects citizenship.25Ruiz Zambrano (C-34/09) [2011] E.C.R.

These are fundamental rights of all persons, protectingevery person under the jurisdiction of the EU or its Member States. Yet activating them within the scopeof application of Union citizenship turns it into a citizen right.There is also agreement that Union citizenship protects against legal exclusion through removing aUnion citizen’s nationality, entailing the loss of Union citizenship. Such legal exclusion would result froma Member State removing its nationality, thereby automatically stripping the individual concerned ofUnion citizenship. In Rottmann31 the Court found that this is a matter of EU law. Rottmann, who hadAustrian nationality, had acquired German nationality and, as a result, lost his Austrian nationality. Whenthe German authorities discovered that Rottmann had made false representations during the naturalisationprocedure, they removed his German nationality. In its preliminary ruling, the Court found that the statusas a citizen of the Union conferred by art.20 of the TFEU applies to this constellation. As such, in Rottmannthe Court makes it clear that the removal of a Member State’s nationality, because of its implications forUnion citizenship, becomes a matter of EU law and not only of national laws. The consequence of this isthat removal of the status follows different rules than the conferral that is solely governed by nationallaws. In consequence, the national court must ascertain whether the principle of proportionality in thelight of national and EU law is observed.32 The added value is that Union law criteria and in particular therights in Union law that the individual will lose with its nationality provide a further standard that thenational measure must comply with. How this proportionality test will be further developed, on the levelof national legislation (concerning the proportionality of the law itself) and administrative measures inindividual cases, remains to be seen. Interesting developments are to be expected from the pending caseof Tjebbes.33 The case concerns adults of Netherlands nationality and their children who had always livedin third countries. Advocate General Mengozzi accepts in his Opinion34 that the proportionality review ofa national law that leads to the loss of nationality under certain circumstances ex lege is performed inabstracto and without considering every possible individual circumstance, as this would replace the criteriathat the national legislature has chosen. Crucially important is, however, that the individual has the optionto influence the loss of citizenship. According to Netherlands law, a Netherlands national would only loseits nationality if living in a country outside the EU for more than 10 years. However, this period isinterrupted if the person concerned has principal residence in the EU for a period of not less than one yearor applies for the issue of a declaration regarding the possession of Netherlands nationality, a passport ora Netherlands identity card, to demonstrate that there is a link with the Netherlands and the individualwishes to continue this. The person concerned thus has the option of retaining Dutch nationality, evenwithout taking up residence, simply by applying for a renewed passport within the 10-year period.Consequently, the AG sees the situation of minors differently: they lose nationality as a consequence ofthe loss of nationality of one parent. Minors do not have the opporuntity to avoid that loss by applyingfor the relevant documents. Thus, according to the AG, the national law on losing nationality as far asminors are concerned is not compatible with the autonomy of their status of Union citizenship given itsproportionality.31Rottmann (C-135/08) [2010] E.C.R.

The referred questions read: “Must Articles 20 and 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in the light of,inter alia, Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, be interpreted—in view of the absence of an individual assessment,based on the principle of proportionality, with regard to the consequences of the loss of nationality for the situation of the person concerned from thepoint of view of EU law—as precluding legislation such as that in issue in the main proceedings, which provides: (a) that an adult, who is also a nationalof a third country, loses, by operation of law, the nationality of his or her Member State, and consequently loses citizenship of the Union, on the groundthat, for an uninterrupted period of 10 years, that person had his or her principal residence abroad and outside the European Union, although there arepossibilities for interrupting that 10-year period; (b) that under certain circumstances a minor loses, by operation of law, the nationality of his or herMember State, and consequently loses citizenship of the Union, as a consequence of the loss of the nationality of his or her parent, as referred to under(a) above?” (emphasis added).34 Tjebbes (C-221/17), Opinion of AG Mengozzi, 12 July 2018. The discussion of the Opinion above is based on the French text, with the Englishtranslation not yet available.Revisiting Union Citizenship from a Fundamental Rights Perspective in the Time of Brexit 455[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsSince Rottmann, the status of Union citizenship is engaged by an individual losing any nationality ofa Member State and thereby his or her Union citizenship. The AG in the Tjebbes case confirms that nofurther link with EU law other than the citizenship is required. He then signals that Union law requiresproportionality between the interest of the state to set rules for the acquisition and loss of nationality andthe interests of the individual concerned in maintaining links with the Member State and hence the EU.The additional protection of Union law provided by the proportionality test is tangible in the situation ofloss of nationality. EU law increases the protection of the established link with the Member State becausethe individual has also received the promise of protection from the Union legal order in receiving Unioncitizenship, without replacing national law criteria for the continued existence of the link. The specificvalue judgment is that the loss of Union citizenship is more likely to be proportional in relation to individualcircumstances, for instances in cases where the individual has deceived authorities in obtaining thenationality of a Member State or the individual has had the option to avoid the loss of nationality.Conversely, a much stricter proportionality test is applicable in cases where individuals are not in a positionto avoid the loss of Union citizenship.2. Protection of Union citizens in the state–state relationshipThe case-law extends this protection of Union citizens against exclusion to non-extradition to a third state.Petruhhin35 concerned an Estonian national resident in Latvia. The Russian Federation sought his extraditionby Latvia for crimes allegedly committed by Petruhhin in Russia. Upon referral, the Court ruled that EUlaw constituted a bar to such extradition. Petruhhin had exercised his right to free movement under art.21of the TFEU and hence the matter was within the scope of EU law. The Court also found that under theright to non-discrimination on the ground of nationality set forth in art.18 of the TFEU the citizen benefitedfrom the constitutional guarantee of non-extradition for Latvian nationals under Latvian constitutionallaw.36 Non-discrimination meant that any different treatment of Petruhhin had to be proportionate, andthat extradition to Estonia was a less severe restriction than extradition to Russia. Union citizenship thusincorporates fundamental citizens rights that constitutional law enshrines. Admittedly, this constitutionallaw protects absolutely against any extradition to a third country. Yet the Court achieved a similar levelof protection, by additionally applying art.19(2) of the Charter, obliging the national court to scrutinisewhether the citizen was facing the risk of inhuman or degrading treatment in the RussianFederation.37Schotthöfer illustrates this absolute link with the EU legal order.38 The Union citizen there,the Austrian Adelsmayr, ran a “serious risk” within the meaning of art.19(2) of the Charter of beingsubjected to the death penalty upon being extradited to Saudi Arabia, outlawed by art.2 of the Charter.Germany therefore had to reject the request for extradition of Adelsmayr. This ruling links Union citizenshipwith non-extradition from the EU territory as a whole. It demands that Member States incorporate theprotection that constitutional law offers to their own citizens to Union citizens and this is underpinned bythe protection standard of the Charter. The individual obtains a subjective right that is bolstered up byconstitution law and Union law against the host state not to be extradited, and the legal link for this claimis Union citizenship. This case-law demonstrates how the concept of Union citizenship receives itsnormativity from national constitutional law and the Charter. It also illustrates that while it is a Unionconcept, Member States are obliged to ensure they meet the required standard of protection that theirconstitutions, Union law and the normativity of the fundamental right of art.19 that the Charter enshrines.35Aleksei Petruhhin (C-182/15), 6 September 2016 [hereinafter Petruhhin].36Petruhhin (C-182/15) at [32].37Petruhhin (C-182/15) at [51].38Peter Schotthöfer & Florian Steiner GbR v Eugen Adelsmayr (C-473/15), Order of the Court of 6 September 2017 [hereinafter Schotthöfer].456 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsIn Pisciotti,39 the Court has held that these protections also apply in the context of an EU extraditiontreaty. The US had requested Germany to extradite an Italian national, Pisciotti, who relied on thenon-discriminatory application of the guarantee of non-extradition of German nationals in art.16 of theGerman Constitution. The Court found that Pisciotti had exercised his free movement right under art.21of the TFEU by stopping over in Frankfurt airport, opening the scope of application of that provision andof art.18 of the TFEU. However, the Court’s further analysis is focused exclusively on the right of art.21of the TFEU, rather than non-discrimination. The Court found that extradition is an interference that mustbe proportionate to the objective of effective criminal prosecution. The Member State therefore has tochoose the less restrictive means. Extradition to Member States pursuant to the European Arrest Warrant40is in principle the less severe restriction than extradition to a third state. Only if no such request isforthcoming, as it was the case in Pisciotti, then extradition to a third state is possible.In a development of Petruhhin, Pisciotti provides protection of the citizen against extradition solelywithin Union citizenship law. This protection integrates the fundamental right normativity of theconstitutional law of the Member States, but does no longer resort to it. The Union citizen is protectedagainst such physical removal from the territory of the EU by virtue of Union citizenship law, autonomouslyand independent of incorporated constitutional law of the Member State of residence. This protectionsolely depends on the citizen having exercised his or her right to freedom of free movement, but thatexercise may be fleeting as in an airport stopover (Pisciotti) or even a planned journey (Schotthöfer).41For the continued exercise of that right, the citizen must then meet the conditions that secondary law laysdown.42 Extradition of a Union citizen to a third state is unlawful, with the sole condition of a requestforthcoming under the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant. But art.19(2) of the Charter,prohibiting any extradition—or expulsion—to a third country where the citizen faces the risk of inhumantreatment would still constitute an absolute bar even where no such request is forthcoming.II. Union citizenship-as-fundamental rightThe above discussion of the case-law on Union citizenship has shown that status yields a right to resideas well as certain limits on the indirect loss of Union citizenship resulting from the removal of nationality.Treaty-based status, however, does not fully explain the expansive jurisprudence, nor does it allow itsconsistent legal reconstruction. This section therefore casts the novel perspective of Union citizenshiphaving the normative quality of a fundamental right.Fundamental rights own a specific normativity over other law, and the first step therefore will be toidentify the specific normativity of inclusion/non-exclusion into the EU legal order. This normativity canbe shown to have two functions: it is explanatory and legal-reconstructive of the case-law.The second step is to identify the hard edge of that normativity: that no-one can be excluded againsttheir will from the protection that citizenship entails. Union citizenship is protected against measures toremove it by the Member States or the EU. Brexit becomes a prism on the nature of Union citizenshipprecisely because it directly removes Union citizenship, but not nationality.While the Court is yet to take this step, the fundamental rights law of the EU provides strong authorityfor it. The section first analyses the guarantees that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EuropeanUnion sets forth for the rights of Union citizenship. While there is no express guarantee of that citizenship39Roamano Pisciotti v Bundesrepublik Deutschland (C-191/16), 10 April 2018 [hereinafter Pisciotti].40Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between MemberStates, [2002] OJ L 190/1, 18 July 2002.41 Schotthöfer (C-473/15) at [21].42Elisabeta Dano and Florin Dano v Jobcenter Leipzig (C-333/13), 11 November 2014. This restrictive approach of the Court to economicallyinactive Union citizens has met with strong criticism, see Daniel Thym, “When Union Citizens Turn into Illegal Immigrants: The Dano Case“ (2015)40 Eur. L. Rev. 249; R. McCrea, ”Forward or Back: The Future of European Integration and the Impossibility of the Status Quo“ (2017) 23 Eur. L.J.66.Revisiting Union Citizenship from a Fundamental Rights Perspective in the Time of Brexit 457[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsitself, that is the logical consequence, compatible with the declaratory function of the Charter. The sectionthen considers the general principles of EU law, as a complementary source of EU fundamental rights.The qualitative comparison of the constitutional traditions of the Member States supports Unioncitizenship-as-fundamental right, and so does European and international human rights law.1. The normativity of Union citizenship-as-fundamental rightWhereas the fundamental status quality of Union citizenship is now well-established and accepted, thecases cannot be satisfactorily explained by way of Union citizenship as a status in the Treaty. The directionof travel of the decisions of the Court and the influence of the Charter warrant the need for those cases tobe looked at from the frameset of an underlying consistent normativity, instead of simply that of a status.The decisions instantiate the normativity of a fundamental right of Union citizenship.The normative conception of Union citizenship-as-fundamental right secures the reliable inclusion ofindividuals in the EU legal order and their effective protection from exclusion. The individual is includedin this legal order designed to enable individual self-determination and human dignity.43 The dichotomyof inclusion and exclusion is sometimes applied to different sets of persons. But this dichotomy reallyapplies to a given set of people. These are included, and, as a corollary, protected against exclusion. Thatinclusion has strong connections with democratic self-governance. One is included in the legal order thatone has had a chance to shape. Democracy in the EU is based on the inclusion of citizens. This is powerfullyexpressed in art.14(1) of the TEU, which after amendment by the Lisbon Treaty provides that the EuropeanParliament represents the citizens of the Union, rather than the peoples of the Member States. UnionCitizenship embodies the promise by the EU of protectionwhen this inclusion is threatened.44Non-exclusionof individuals is the other side of their inclusion, against both physical or legal exclusion from that legalorder and the territory over which it applies. The life choices of individuals based on Union citizenshipand the EU legal order can ultimately be protected only by the EU. This trust the EU must answer in amanner commensurate with its organisation as a union of states, providing protection through internal andexternal action beyond its territory under its attributed competences.Grounded in this normativity, Union citizenship becomes the legal institution creating a direct relationbetween the individual and the EU and its legal order.45 Individuals are included in that legal order andprotected from being excluded from it. This holds true regardless of Union citizenship being acquired as“ius tractum”46 and derived from state nationality. This is only about construction of acquisition of thatcitizenship. It cannot tell us anything about the substance.47 In fact, a comparative approach reveals thatsuch models have been tested before in federal systems where the citizenship in the larger polity wasderived from those of the smaller polities.48This normativity is explanatory of the direction of the case-law, it is reconstructive in that it providesa novel consistent framework, and it is normative in pointing beyond the established cases.This uniform normativity makes apparent that Union citizenship is more than a bundle of rights thatcitizens hold. It provides the single overarching rationale. As such, it explains the direction of the case-lawin expanding the scope of Union citizenship beyond the expressly stipulated rights of citizens or its status.The Court relies on the normativity of a fundamental rights-based approach to Union citizenship to ensure43Van Gend en Loos (26/62) [1963] E.C.R. 2 (the creation of individual rights is the marker of the new legal order that the Treaty of Rome establishes).44Barnard, The Substantive Law of the European Union (2016), p.230.45Reaching a similar conclusion that rights derive directly from EU citizenship and are not mediated by national law, Dora Kostakopoulou, “ScalaCivium: Citizenship Templates Post-Brexit and the European Union’s Duty to Protect EU Citizens” (2018) 56 J. Common Market Studies 854.46Dimitry Kochenov, “Ius tractum of many faces: European citizenship and the difficult relationship between status and rights” (2009) 15 Colum.J. Eur. L. 169.47 See Anja Lansbergen and Jo Shaw, “National Membership Models in a Multilevel Europe” (2010) 8 I.J.C.L. 50.48See Dieter Gosewinkel, Schutz und Freiheit? Staatsbürgerschaft in Europa im 20. und 21. Jahrhundert (Suhrkamp, 2016) (citizenship of the newGerman state was derived from citizenship of one of its constituent Länder from 1871 up until 1913 when a uniform federal law on citizenship enteredinto force).458 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsprotection of Union citizens against their exclusion, where Treaty or secondary law do not provide this.That normativity drives the evolving case-law precluding acts of exclusion through de facto expulsionand extradition to a third state, but not to another Member State. Such acts not only exclude the Unioncitizen from the territory of the EU. They also exclude him or her from the EU legal order and submitthem to another legal order that he or she has no say in making and that may diverge considerably fromthe values and guarantees of the EU legal order. The rationale of these cases underpins “status” with anincreasingly thick layer of general fundamental rights, ranging from the right to a family life to the rightof the child, to tilt the balance towards non-exclusion.That normativity also permits reconstructing a coherent legal framework. That framework draws onthe recognised threefold dimension of fundamental rights, which require the addressees to respect, toprotect and to fulfil.49 In the dimension of respect, all limitations imposed by public authority becomesubject to strict controls. Fundamental rights can, of course, be limited, particularly where there is acollision of rights of others or for recognised general interests. This requires proportionality of the measuretaken. But fundamental rights also indicate an absolute limit to exclusionary action that cannot beoverridden. Expulsion or extradition from the Union’s territory may then conflict with the essence of thefundamental rights of the Charter. The Court in Petruhhin and Pisciotti accepts that non-exclusion canstill be overridden for legitimate objectives of public policy. The limit is the absolute prohibition ofexpulsion or extradition to a third state where the citizen faces the threat of inhuman treatment, groundedin human dignity.50 While the Court was not called upon on the facts of any these cases to say so, thisreinforcing incorporation of art.19 of the Charter extends to the right not to be expelled by a collectivemeasure equally repugnant to human dignity that the first paragraph enshrines.51 This essence is groundedin the master fundamental right of human dignity, art.1 of the Charter. It marks a Union citizenship asbelonging to a legal order grounded in human dignity.2. Protection against legal exclusionExtradition or expulsion excludes the citizen from the protective EU legal order, removing him or herfrom the EU territory. Evenmore than physical exclusion, the exclusion that results from the legal removalof Union citizenship is final. The Court has yet to rule on that aspect of protection against exclusion fromthe EU legal order that is the consequence of a removal of Union citizenship.Union citizenship, in this constellation, demonstrates its normative-constructive function. Such removaldoes away with the basis for all the citizens’ rights that the Treaty and the case-law provide, to reside, tovote, and not to be expelled or extradited. The individual finds himself or herself cut off from much ofthe EU legal order, and a legal vacuum replaces the certainty this citizenship seeks to establish. As such,removing Union citizenship is more than a change in status; it interferes with the promise of protectioninherent in the concept of citizenship.The protection can be relative in individual cases where the measure is backed by legitimate cause,proportionate and taken in a non-arbitrary procedure. Removal for legitimate reasons pertaining to theindividual remains permissible. But protection must be absolute against collective measures that strip agroup of people of their citizenship and the concomitant rights against their will. Such collective measures49The obligation to respect means that states must refrain from interfering with or curtailing the enjoyment of human rights. The obligation to protectrequires states to protect individuals and groups against human rights abuses. The obligation to fulfil means that states must take positive action tofacilitate the enjoyment of basic human rights.50Petruhhin (C-182/15) at [56]: “In that regard, reference must be made to Article 4 of the Charter which prohibits inhuman or degrading treatmentor punishment and it should be noted that that prohibition is absolute in that it is closely linked to respect for human dignity, the subject of Article 1of the Charter.” (emphasis added) Also Joined Cases, Aranyosi and Căldăraru (C-404/15 and C-659/15 PPU), 5 April 2016 at [85].51Article 19 amalgamates two separate ECHR rights that functionally protect against exclusion: art.19(2) replicates art.3 of the ECHR that, asinterpreted by the European Court of Human Rights, prohibits expulsion or extradition to a state where there is a serious risk of inhuman treatment.Article 19(1) replicates art.4 of the Fourth Additional Protocol to the ECHR. Article 19 does not replicate art.3 of that protocol, which guarantees thatno one shall be expelled from the territory of the state of which he is a national or be deprived of the right to enter its territory.Revisiting Union Citizenship from a Fundamental Rights Perspective in the Time of Brexit 459[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsinfringe the consented understanding of human dignity that precludes making people the object of publicpolicies. Collective removal of Union citizenship is impermissible, absolutely.What is the legal consequenceof this fundamental right not to be deprived of Union citizenship against one’s will in an arbitrary orcollective manner? Interference is unlawful and does not produce legal effect, and thus the individual’scitizenship continues.Such legal removal of Union citizenship by Member States is the scenario of Brexit. Brexit is legallythe decision of the UK to terminate the Treaties between it and the Member States. It is a state measureintended to remove Union citizenship directly, rather than indirectly, in the Rottmann scenario, as theautomatic consequence of the removal of its nationality by a Member State. It is a collective measure thataffects groups of people indiscriminately. It strips UK nationals of their Union citizenship, and for EU27nationals on UK territory hollows out the substance, for many against their will or, like with minors,without them being able to assert their view.Member States confer Union citizenship through nationality, and must respect, protect and promoteit. But where there they do not fulfil the promises that come with it, the Union itself must protect itscitizens. It provides that protection through judicial protection before the courts, in the citizen–state andin the state–state constellations. But, as Brexit demonstrates, it also provides protection through politicaland legal action. The Withdrawal Agreement with the UK is such action, serving to preserve the rightsof citizens, both of EU 27 and of UK nationality in a new international law context after the departure ofthe UK.3. The legal basis in the EU Charter of Fundamental RightsThis normative conception of Union citizenship-as-fundamental right has a legal basis in the EU Charterof Fundamental Rights. Article 6(1) of the TEUmakes the Charter part of the binding primary law, locatedat the apex of the EU legal order and on par with the Treaties.52 In its preamble, the Charter establishesthe individualist, fundamental rights-grounded normativity of citizenship of the Union.53 Admittedly, onits wording, the Charter does not enshrine a fundamental right to Union citizenship, or against removalor extradition. An immediate criticism could then relate to the fact the Charter is supposed to have adeclarative/declaratory nature and not to create new rights.Yet, the principal argument is that a fundamental right is a logical consequence of Union citizenshipand thus does not affect the declarative nature of the Charter. The Charter provides all the stepping stones,by making clear that rights of citizens have that quality. The precondition of having and retaining thestatus becomes implicitly guaranteed, as the essence of each of these rights.Chapter V of the Charter enshrines specific fundamental rights held by Union citizens. These areinclusive rights. Article 39(1) of the Charter guarantees the fundamental right of citizens to vote and standfor the European Parliament. Article 45(1) of the Charter guarantees the fundamental right of all citizens,including the non-economically active, to reside in the territory of the Member States. Furthermore, in itsChapter II on Freedoms, the Charter turns the fundamental freedoms of the Treaty into fundamental rightsof Union citizens. In art.15(2) of the Charter, Union citizenship is the basis for the guaranteed fundamentalright to seek employment, to work, to exercise the right of establishment and to provide services in theMember State. Hence, the Charter provides a fundamental right quality to the rights that citizens holdunder the Treaty that are status-based. The added normative layer can become operational. The judgmentof the Court in Delvigne illustrates this. The Court there connects arts 20(2)(b), 22 of the TFEU with52Pilar Juarez Perez, “La inevitable extension de la ciudadania de la Union: a proposito de la STJUE de 8 deMarzo de 2011 (Asunto Ruiz Zambrano)”(2011) 3/2 Cuadernos de Derecho Transnacional 249–266 (considering Zambrano as the first example of the Charter elevating Union Citizenship tothe level of a fundamental right).53Preamble, 2nd para: “it [the Union] is based on the principles of democracy and the rule of law. It places the individual at the heart of its activities,by establishing the citizenship of the Union”.460 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsart.39(1) of the Charter, the right to vote for the European Parliament in another Member State. The Courtalso connects the institutional provision of art.14 of the TEU on European Parliament elections with thefundamental right to universal suffrage set forth in art.39(2) of the Charter.54 The result is that there is afundamental right to vote in one’s own Member State under the Charter that goes beyond what the Treatyprovides.Article 52(2) of the Charter55 provides the conduit between the two manifestations of the same right inthe Charter and the Treaty. It re-inserts the interpretation of the Charter rights into the correspondingTreaty rights and vice versa.56The Charter does not enshrine citizens rights against exclusion. But it contains general fundamentalrights such as the right to a private life and the prohibition against inhuman treatment that provide protectionagainst physical exclusion. These are general fundamental rights for all that are under the jurisdiction ofthe Member States, including citizens of the Union. These general fundamental rights become functionalcitizens rights securing the residence that they are guaranteed.It is true that the Charter does not enshrine a specific right of Union citizens not be stripped of theircitizenship. Yet, that is not necessary either. In fact, retention of the status of Union Citizenship itself isguaranteed, inherently, in each of these above rights. It is the basis for their exercise. The Charter bringswith it general provisions, Chapter VII, that are integral to each right and define the permissible limitationon the exercise. In art.52(1), the Charter sets forth two such limitations that apply in turn.57 RemovingUnion citizenship is a limitation within the meaning of art.52(1) of the Charter of each right. Such limitationis subject to proportionality and “may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectivesof general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others”. Yet,even such a limitation must also “respect the essence58 of those [citizens’] rights”.59The Grand Chamber of the Court in the Polish Justice case60 has just activated the essence of afundamental right enshrined in the Charter as the ultimate limit for any limitation placed on it. The Courtthere stated that access to an independent court is the essence of the right of judicial protection enshrinedin art.47 of the Charter. A systematic concern for the independence of the judiciary in a Member Statetherefore precludes any extradition to that Member State pursuant to a European Arrest Warrant. Neitherthe requesting nor to the requested Member State nor indeed the Union legislator may limit the essenceof the right of judicial protection of the accused. Such limitation cannot be justified by outweighing generalobjectives of public policy.Unlawful derogation of the status of citizenship is equivalent to derogation of the essence of anyfundamental right that Union citizens can hold. Even when it is argued that the status of citizenship assuch is not a fundamental right in and of its own, given that the possession of Union citizenship is aconstitutive element for the direct and indirect fundamental citizens’ rights in the Charter, its removalinterferes with those rights and their essence. For instance, if an opposition politician would lose nationalityor Union citizenship to prevent him or her running for the European Parliament—this would surely breachart.39 of the Charter. Thus, removal of citizenship would qualify as a violation of the Charter. Theunderlying status cannot be withdrawn lawfully.54 Thierry Delvigne v Commune de Lesparre Médoc and Préfet de la Gironde (C-650/13), 6 October 2015 at [42] [hereinafter Delvigne].55 It reads: “Rights recognised by this Charter for which provision is made in the Treaties shall be exercised under the conditions and within thelimits defined by those Treaties.”56Explanations relating to the Charter [2007] OJ C 303/17, which must be given due regard in interpreting it (art.6(1) of the TEU and art.52(7) ofthe CFR).57 It reads: “Any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by this Charter must be provided for by law and respect the essenceof those rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meetobjectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others”.58Emphasis added.59This being said, the alternative argument can be made that this is further confounding the already difficult application of the primary law, see NicShuibhne, “Integrating Union Citizenship and the Charter of Fundamental Rights”, in D. Thym (ed.), Questioning EU Citizenship: Judges and theLimits of Free Movement and Solidarity in the EU (Hart, 2017), pp.209, 294.60Minister for Justice and Equality (C-216/18 PPU) (Défaillances du système judiciaire), 18 July 2018.Revisiting Union Citizenship from a Fundamental Rights Perspective in the Time of Brexit 461[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThis is particularly true in a situation where the Union citizen does not have the option to exercise anyinfluence in relation to the possibility that Union citizenship is lost, in accordance with the case-law asdiscussed in detail above. Furthermore, as with all fundamental rights, the essence or core of eachfundamental right is protected absolutely and cannot be restricted.61 Each fundamental right has an essentialcontent which enjoys enhanced protection. Interference with that essence cannot be justified.The master norm of the Charter, the absolutely protected human dignity enshrined in art.1 of the Charter,reinforces the fundamental right not to lose one’s Union citizenship without consent. Human dignityprecludes treating people as mere objects of public authority. Ultimately, protecting human dignity byway of fundamental rights ensures that in case of conflict between law and political power, law prevailsat the very least in the form of subjective protection that it has to offer in all western democracies. Thishuman dignity manifests itself in the situation of Union citizens that have exercised their Treaty-bestowedright to move to another Member State trusting in permanency, but bear the consequences of a contrarypublic decision to exclude them from the protection of the Treaties having nothing to do with them ortheir actions. The emphasis on individual action and life choices chimes with the dominant principle ofUnion citizenship law. This principle is that the reasons the host state may invoke to terminate residencemust be exclusively personal and must not be collective.62This Union citizenship as the essence of the citizens’ fundamental right under the Charter is groundedin the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Article 52(3) of the Charter determines that theECHR constitutes the minimum threshold of any corresponding right in the Charter. This threshold includesthe jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights that shapes the rights of the ECHR. The CJEUmust follow this jurisprudence and adopt a congruent interpretation of the corresponding Charter right.The ECHR does not contain a separate fundamental right of citizenship. Yet, the European Court of HumanRights has effectively developed an equivalent protection of status within the fundamental right to a privatelife that art.8 of the ECHR enshrines. The European Court of Human Rights adopts this reasoning inKurić.63 The case concerned the policy of “erasure”, under which Slovenia removed 25,671 of its residentsthat had not obtained Slovenian citizenship from the register of permanent residents and transferred themto the register of aliens, following the country’s secession from the former Yugoslavia in 1992 and thedeclaration of Slovenia’s independence. These individuals were left without a right to lawfully reside inthe territory of Slovenia. InKurić, the Grand Chamber found that Slovenia had violated art.8 of the ECHRon the right to a family life, because (i) there was an interference through the denial of residence, (ii)which had no basis in Slovenian law, (iii) and that while the creation of a corpus of Slovenian nationalswas a legitimate objective, (iv) it was disproportionate to deprive the applicants of their status that hadgiven them access to a range of rights. The Kurić Court thus interprets art.8 of the ECHR to protect thestatus of being included in the register of permanent residents against the collective measure of erasureon two levels. First, the mere fact that no procedure was put in place to settle the status for ex-SFRYcitizens holding the citizenship of one of the other successor republics, but who had been lawfully residingin Slovenia prior to the independence declaration, created a legal vacuum violating art.8 of the ECHR.While that lack of a sufficient legal basis would have been sufficient to find an infringement of art.8 ofthe ECHR, the Court deliberately examined whether the measure pursued a legitimate aim and wasproportionate to it.64 It acknowledged that the protection of the country’s circle of citizens would belegitimate, however, the measure was not necessary in a democratic society, violating art.8 of the ECHRgiven the radical repercussions of “erasure” that removed the basis of all other rights of the individuals61Article 52(1) of the Charter corresponds to art.19(2) of the German Basic Law that also separately protects the essence of each fundamental right.Further on the relation between proportionality and essence, seeManfred Stelzer,DasWesensgehaltsargument und der Grundsatz der Verhältnismäßigkeit(Vienna: Springer, 1991).62Article 27 of Directive 2004/38/EC.63Kurić v Slovenia (App. No.26828/06), judgment of 26 June 2012 [hereinafter Kurić].64Kurić (App. No.26828/06) at [350].462 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsconcerned. The Court protects the status precisely because it gives access to a wide range of rights. Thestatus is the basis of a set of rights essential for leading a private life in dignity, specifically under Slovenianlaw. Protection of fundamental rights begins at the very roots of these rights, the right to be included in aparticular legal order. Removing the status through a collective measure such as erasure violates the veryessence of that right to a family life. It is important to note that the Court is not concerned with theprevention of statelessness, as most applicants inKurić indeed did have the nationality of another successorstate.Article 51(1) of the Charter specifies the addressees of that fundamental right. Accordingly, the EU isbound for all its institutions and in all its policies. That is important, in regard for instance to theinterpretation and application of art.50 of the TEU and subsequently the Withdrawal Agreement that willbecome EU law. By contrast, according to art.51(1) of the Charter, the Member States are only bound bythe Charter when implementing other EU law. Member States are implementing EU law in this sensewhen the Treaty’s citizenship provisions are controlling. The Court has adopted an increasingly broadinterpretation of the Treaty’s citizens free movement right that now even covers a merely planned trip toanother Member State.65 But going even further, in the Rottmann/Tjebbes constellation, the interferencewith Union citizenship itself constitutes the sufficient nexus. In that constellation, the Member States arealways implementing the Treaty and therefore bound to respect the fundamental right to Union citizenship.4. The complementary basis in the general principles of EU law: the constitutionaltraditions of the Member States and international human rights law on citizenshipPost-Lisbon, the Charter, in line with the intention to enhance legal certainty, has been taking pride ofplace in the practical protection of fundamental rights against both the EU and its Member States. TheCourt applies the manifestation of a fundamental right in the written Charter over the unwritten generalprinciples.66Yet, the Charter does not legally supersede or displace this other source of fundamental rights.Article 6(3) of the TEUmakes clear that the general principles of Union law continue to be a valid source.These sources have a mutually reinforcing effect.67Under the formula developed by the Court and now laid down in art.6(3) of the TEU, the standards ofconstitutional law of the Member States and international human rights law form general principles ofEU law. It has always been, and continues to be, the very conceptual presupposition of the general principlesas source of EU fundamental rights that those fundamental rights enshrined in national constitutions canbe transferred to the different normative environment of the EU because the threats faced by individualshad become similar and needed a fundamental rights limitation. The fundamental right to privacy anddigital information is an example. It was hatched originally in the context of the constitutional state, butwas then transferred to the EU level and has become a very salient constraint on EU action.68 Citizenshipis not different. Also hedged in that context of a nation state, it has now been transferred to the EU leveland therefore the guarantees pertaining to it have been transferred to the EU level. As it is for privacy,Union citizenship needs protection against action or inaction of the EU, as well of the Member Stateswhen implementing EU law.65 Schotthöfer (C-473/15) at [21].66This may also have to do with the legitimacy of having been adopted through the treaty-amending process, see Koen Lenaerts and José AntonioGutiérrez-Fons, “The Place of the Charter in the EU Constitutional Edifice”, in Steve Peers, Tamara Hervey, Jeff Kenner and Angela Ward (eds), TheEU Charter of Fundamental Rights (Hart, 2014), p.1560.67For an understanding of the sources of fundamental rights listed in art.6 of the TEU in a non-hierarchical, complementary relationship, see HerwigC.H.

The secondmechanism is the guarantee of non-discrimination. Article 18 of the TFEU prescribes that fundamentalright guarantees of a Member State for its nationals are extended, on a non-discriminatory basis, to allUnion citizens. Article 18 of the TFEU, which prohibits discrimination between Union citizens on thebasis of nationality, transfers to the EU level the specific guarantees against extradition to any other countryand non-deprivation of nationality for its nationals thatMember States constitutional law typically enshrines.As a result, Union citizens now enjoy those guarantees within the territory of the Union regardless of theirnationality and even in the territory of their own Member State.Constitutional and international human rights law give a clear matrix of citizenship. For conferral ofcitizenship there are several models with discretion for the state on the attribution of citizenshipunquestioned. Yet, once it has been conferred, strict fundamental rights controls apply, restricting thepowers of the state regarding removal of that citizenship collectively and also individually. But a secondelement of that matrix is the protection against extradition. National constitutional law protects citizensagainst both legal and physical exclusion from their legal order. Non-exclusion from a specific protectivelegal order is the rationale of those guarantees, and not just the prevention of statelessness. Member Statesconstitutions that include the fundamental right of citizens not to lose their citizenship against their willalso provide for the consequences of any violation. That consequence is the continued and uninterruptedcitizenship.69National constitutional law protects against the loss of citizenship, as a fundamental right, in threesituations: removal through a collective decision, removal through an individual decision, and removalthrough territorial changes. The first two guarantees react to the totalitarian experience and are thereforefound in the family of post-totalitarian constitutions of theMember States. For example, art.16 of the 1949German Basic Law70 protects against deprivation of citizenship by general measures absolutely, whileindividual removal is subject to proportionate measures.71 It also protects against extradition. Article 26(1)and (4) of the Portuguese Constitution72 consider citizenship to be a fundamental right that can only beremoved in a very limited set of circumstances. Article 11(2) of the 1978 Spanish Constitution73 recognisesthe fundamental nature of citizenship and explicitly bars the possibility of non-naturalised individualsbeing stripped of their Spanish nationality. Section 8 of the 1992 Estonian Constitution74 recognises thefundamental nature of citizenship and explicitly bars the possibility of non-naturalised individuals beingstripped of their nationality. Article 98 of the Latvian Constitution precludes any extradition of its citizens.Article 9 of the Croatian Constitution that came into force upon its accession to the EU in 2009 providesthat a citizen of the Republic of Croatia may not be forcibly exiled from the Republic of Croatia nordeprived of citizenship, nor extradited to another state, except in case of execution of a decision onextradition or surrender made in compliance with international treaty or the EU acquis communautaire.This constitution also guarantees the Union citizenship of Croatian nationals, arguably as a fundamentalright.7569 See, for instance, art.116(2)(2) of the Basic Law of Germany. It establishes that persons unlawfully stripped of their nationality are deemed notto have lost it if they took up residence again after 1945.70English translation available at: https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/EN/StatischeSeiten/breg/basic-law-content-list.html [Accessed 2 October2018].71 Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, Case 2 BvR 669/04, Judgment of 24 May 2006, 116 BVerfGE 24.72English translation available at: http://www.en.parlamento.pt/Legislation/CRP/Constitution7th.pdf [Accessed 2 October 2018].73English translation available at: https://www.boe.es/legislacion/documentos/ConstitucionINGLES.pdf [Accessed 2 October 2018].74English translation available at: https://www.president.ee/en/republic-of-estonia/the-constitution/ [Accessed October 2018].75Article 152 of the Croatian Constitution provides that: “Citizens of the Republic of Croatia shall be European Union citizens and enjoy the rightsguaranteed by the European Union acquis communautaire, and in particular:… In the Republic of Croatia, all rights guaranteed by the European Unionacquis communautaire shall be enjoyed by all citizens of the European Union.” Official Journal of the Republic of Croatia, Narodne novine (N.N.),No.85/2010, 6 July 2010.

Even if citizenship can beset aside on an individual basis, states are unable to deprive an entire group oftheir citizenships, even asa consequence of territorial changes. In particular, UK citizenship law has adopted pragmatism andflexibility to respond to situations under which political and constitutional changes would otherwise haveresulted in groups of individuals being deprived of rights which they had previously enjoyed. The UK hasaccorded to Irish citizens and to the citizens of Commonwealth countries rights equivalent to those of UKcitizens. In the case of Irish citizens the continuing rights enjoyed extend to full freedom of movement toand from the UK and a right of abode there.76 The same is true of those Commonwealth citizens who aregranted the right of abode in the UK. German constitutional law provides another precedent for continuingcitizenship despite territorial changes. The Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), considereditself the continuer of the German state albeit on a smaller territory. The Federal Republic treated Germansresident in the German Democratic Republic as its citizens under the continuing German citizenship lawof 1913. This citizenship could also be passed on to descendants.77In fact, and importantly, the EU in its practice has adopted this pattern of preserving rights conferredby its legal order in instances of territorial changes. The EU accepts the principle, familiar from the lawof international organisation, that boundaries are flexible. That means that losses of territory of a stateleave its membership in the organisation unaffected. It remains the same member, but with a differentterritory. This rule of membership with flexible boundaries is subject to the caveat that the rights thatindividuals resident on this territory hold under EU law be preserved. In 1986, Greenland withdrew fromthe European Community after a referendum. The then European Community and Denmark concluded atreaty providing that the Treaties would cease to apply in Greenland while preserving the rights of Unioncitizens already resident there.78 The explanatory memorandum of the Commission makes explicit thatthose Treaty-based individual rights ought to be preserved in the same manner as the acquired pensionrights.79 Finally, the practice of the EU has also been to preserve national citizenships as much as possiblein the event of the break-up of the home state.80 This practice conforms with the international law principlethat territorial change should not affect existing citizenships formulated in the 2006 Council of EuropeConvention on the Avoidance of Statelessness in relation to State Succession.81Article 2 recognises anindividual right to a nationality.82Article 6 obligates the predecessor not to withdraw its nationality evenif those nationals live now in a successor state, provided that the national has not acquired the nationalityof that state or would otherwise become stateless. This puts it in the hands of the individual to retain their76The status of Irish citizens resident in the UK was finally fixed by the Ireland Act 1949. Under that Act there was full recognition by the UK ofcomplete political separation between the UK and the Irish Republic. But s.2 of the 1949 Act recognised that the Republic of Ireland was not (and isnot) to be regarded as a foreign country for the purposes of UK legislation. So Irish citizens born before 1922 in that part of Ireland which passed underthe jurisdiction of the Irish Republic and who had not resided there throughout the intervening period were enabled to retain UK citizenship, and Irishcitizens resident in the UK could acquire UK citizenship by registration. Irish citizens who resided in the UK, whilst remaining Irish citizens, werepermitted to enjoy all the benefits of UK citizenship, including freedom to take up residence and employment in the UK, to vote in parliamentaryelections and seek membership of the national legislature. This was described by the UK Government as “an exchange of citizenship rights” ratherthan common citizenship, HL Deb., 15 December 1948, vol.159 col.1101.

This is also the recent paradox of Catalonia where it was argued Spain could notwithdraw the citizenship en masse to citizens of an independent Catalonia.83International human rights law is a constitutive source of the general principles of EU law.84Article 15of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that no-one may be arbitrarily deprived of hisnationality.85 This has entered into customary international law. The most authoritative recognition of thatcustomary law quality is to be found in the judgment of the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rightsin Anudo.86 The Court there distinguishes between the competence of each state to confer its nationalityand the limits placed on its power to remove that nationality once conferred.Admittedly, the Anudo case on its face is about the issue of statelessness which is not the case with theloss of Union citizenship. The Court refers to the prevention of statelessness as the rationale of art.15 ofthe UDHR. There is, however, space for analogy. The loss of rights it implies is not far from a partialstatelessness. Statelessness is a human rights concern precisely because it signifies lack of the elementaryprotection of the individual that the state can and must provide. This rationale also applies to Unioncitizenship. Union citizenship ensures a specific protection that only the EU, because and within the sphereof its conferred competences, can provide.III. Three counter-argumentsAttributing the normative quality of a fundamental right to Union citizenship is a novel argument thatdeparts from the consensus. For it to be convincing, it does not suffice to make the positive case. It is alsonecessary to confront potential or actual counter-arguments. This section deals with and refutes three sucharguments: (1) that there is a categorial difference between national and Union citizenship; (2) that nexusbetween EU membership of the state of nationality and Union citizenship, art.20(1) of the TFEU isindelible; and (3) that the collective democratic decision for joining and exiting the EU, guaranteed inart.50 of the TEU, means that no independent Union citizenships can be preserved. More radically, thispart of the article makes the case that since citizenship rights are fundamental rights, they can survive theUK’s withdrawal from the EU. It is true that the rights which the Treaties give to individuals are powerfuland far-reaching, but that does not in itself tell us anything about what happens when the instrument fromwhich they originate is removed. The article counters the proposition that citizenship rights derive fromthe EU Treaties, so if those Treaties cease to bind the UK then the rights must disappear as well.1. A categorical difference between citizenship of the state and of the UnionIs there a categorical difference between citizenship of the state and that of the Union that would somehowmean that only the former but not the latter has the potential of acquiring the normativity of a fundamentalright? It is unquestionably a fact that the EU at present remains an international organisation, and is nota state, and in that sense forms a different if not all easy-to-grasp category of public authority. But thisdoes not mean that construction of membership in its legal order is impossible or categorically different.This organisation of sovereign Member States has, however, produced a legal order that is autonomousfrom both international law and the domestic law of theMember States and whose subjects are individuals(as well as the Member States). That creates the same need to determine the membership in it as it is thecase of domestic legal orders.83Mariona Illamola Dausa, Nacionalitat catalana i/o nacionalitat espanyola.

This is reflected in the wording. It distinguishes between nationalityand national citizenship. In a tradition going back to Marshall and the concept of social citizenship thatrefers to the set of rights that citizens enjoy,87 citizenship is the right to have rights, a right of inclusion ina specific legal order.88 In the case of the EU, a composite polity, that legal order is autonomous.2. Is there an inseparable link between Union citizenship and a state’s EU membershipin Article 20(1) of the TFEU?The fundamental right does not curtail the right of each state to decide on its membership in the EU andto withdraw from it, as enshrined in art.50(1) of the TEU. Hence, withdrawal of the UK from the FoundingTreaties entails that its nationals will become third-country nationals. The article now addresses thecounter-argument against the protection of Union citizenship in a situationwhere aMember States withdrawfrom the Union. This counter-argument is based on the wording of art.20(1) of the TFEU according towhich “every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union”.89 Theprovision does not explicitly address the situation of a Member State ending its membership. It has beenargued that the provision sets forth two criteria which must be satisfied at any time: the individual musthave the nationality of a Member State and the conferring state remains a Member. Admittedly, theprovision can be interpreted in such way.However, a different reading is not against the wording of art.20(1) and, in addition, does meet therequirements of Union citizenship as a fundamental right that protects individuals against exclusion againsttheir will. This section first reconstructs the analytic position of art.20(1) of the TFEU. This provision isnot just on the status of individuals. It represents the competence of the Member States to confer andrevoke their nationality. This competence of theMember States can be limited for the benefit of individuals.a. The competence of the Member States to confer and revoke Union citizenshipThe following discussion seeks to arrive at a clearer understanding of art.20(1) of the TFEU. For thatpurpose, an analysis of the provision identifies two possible concepts. One interpretation of this provisionwould be that it enshrines the rights of each Member State. These have the right to determine the circleof their nationals and, hence, the right to determine who can be and who cannot be a Union citizen. Butsuch an interpretation in terms of rights of states does not do justice to the structure of the FoundingTreaties or to the principle of conferral.Article 20 of the TFEU denotes a division of competences between the EU and the Member States.90This division follows the functional distinction between the concepts of nationality and citizenship.Nationality is the basis of membership and citizenship comprises the fullness of the rights that membersholds. To the Member States is allocated the competence of nationality, under art.20(1) of the TFEU, thatis to confer their nationality entailing as its automatic consequence that Union citizenship is conferred.The competences to define Union citizenship rights are assigned to the EU, which may also add to therights listed in art.20(2) of the TFEU.

This confirmsthe distinction between nationality and citizenship. To the Member States is reserved the competence todefine the fullness of rights that pertain to their citizenship.The Member States have the competence to confer directly their nationality and thereby indirectlyUnion Citizenship, but the reverse is not necessarily true. It is, of course, always problematic to concludefrom a given power to its reversal, the actus contrarius or the competence to revoke what has been granted.The fact that Member States nationality entails Union citizenship does not have to mean as a matter ofpure logic the competence of Member States to take other action to revoke Union citizenship. There is noindication on art.20(1) of the TFEU that the Member States have the power or competence to revokeUnion citizenship in itself at will.b. LimitsBut even if one were prepared to take this step, then this competence of the Member States to revokeUnion citizenship is limited to safeguarding the Union interest over its Union citizenship. This interest inwho is to be Union citizens is becoming increasingly clear and well defined. This interest first imposeslimits on the competence to confer. The Court had noted already in Micheletti that while it is for eachMember State to lay down the conditions for the acquisition of nationality, they must have “due regardto Community law” when doing so.92 More recently, the questions raised by the EU institutions relatingto “cash for passports” schemes that allow wealthy individuals to acquire Member State nationality speakof the same principle.93Rottmann articulates and operationalises a limit on the competence to revoke theirnationality. There the interest in the status of Union Citizenship constitutively limits the competence ofthat Member State to remove its nationality if this would lead to a specific case of statelessness, that isthe loss of the nationality of an EU Member State. Lounes now formulates a further limit, if implicitly.The Court there ruled that Union citizens retain their permanent right of residence in the host MemberState if they naturalise there later. The rationale of effective free movement of citizens94 limits thecompetence of the Member State to confer its nationality and by the same token to remove the rights ifnot the status of Union citizenship. Ultimately, the rights of Union citizens limit all exclusive competencesof the Member States. Chavez makes this clear. There, while expressly acknowledging that the MemberStates have the competence to determine the residence of third-country nationals on their territory, theCourt made clear that the requirement in EU law to permit their continued residence to care for a Unioncitizen was a limitation on that competence. That limitation was a necessary consequence of the status ofUnion Citizenship entailing the right to reside in the territory of the Union.95That Union interest is even stronger in the constellation of a Member State withdrawing from the EU.The limit becomesmore powerful here where theMember State does not revoke its own citizen’s nationality,but rather targets directly and exclusively the Union Citizenship. No Member State can remove UnionCitizenship from all its nationals through collective action and the decision to leave the EU is not to betreated differently. As such, the departure of the Member State from the EU does not entail the loss ofUnion Citizenship acquired by individuals.92Micheletti v Delegación del Gobierno en Cantabria (C-369/90) [1992] E.C.R. I-4239 at [10].93The Commission has formulated for 2018 a priority to “Safeguard the essence of EU citizenship and its inherent values; in 2017/2018 [it will]produce a report on national schemes granting EU citizenship to investors describing the Commission’s action in this area, current national law andpractices, and providing some guidance for Member States”, EU Citizenship Report 2017, p.14.94 Lounes (C-165/16) at [58] (logic of gradual integration underlying art.21(1) of the TFEU).95Chavez-Vilchez (C-133/15) at [64].468 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsc. The removal of Citizenship through exit from the European UnionIt is suggested here that Union citizens retain their Union citizenship even if the state of which they are anational ceases to be a Member State. The proposition is that, once Union citizenship has been bestowedby a Member State, EU law constrains how it can be removed. Admittedly, that interpretation of art.20of the TFEU does not deal with the fundamental point that after a state ceases to be a Member State, theEU Treaties cannot oblige it to do anything at all, because they will no longer bind it. Two argumentssupport the proposed interpretation, the fundamental rights normativity of Union citizenship to which weturn first and the application of public international law which will be addressed under (3) (below).Union citizenship and the relating rights once bestowed in fact become independent from the Treaties,because they fall into a different normative category. Fundamental rights possess an altogether differentnormativity in which their legal value and continued bindingness is rooted. It is the specific norm-characterthat protects fundamental rights as subjective rights against political power. The Geltungsgrund of Unioncitizenship lies in the specific value of a fundamental right protects the right holder. This stipulatesnecessarily and inherently that the right becomes independent from the reciprocity of the Treaties betweenthe High Contracting States. The normativity is not horizontal between sovereigns, it rather is verticalbetween each sovereign and each individual under their jurisdiction.The consequence of this argument is that this normativity binds not just the exiting state but also theremainingMember States. The remainingMember States are also prevented from denying that the nationalsof the exiting state are Union citizens. The consequent obligations to give effect to this may differ, indetail, for the withdrawing and the remaining Member States. The withdrawing Member State must nottreat its own nationals nor those of the remaining Member States as having lost their Union citizenshipand the related rights. The remaining Member States must not treat the nationals of the withdrawingMember State as having lost their Union citizenship and the related rights. Any limitations can only beimposed for a legitimate reason and in a proportionate manner.3. The collective decision to (Br)exit and the rights of individualsA third conceivable counter-argument relates to art.50 of the TEU. Article 50(1) of the TEU now expresslyrecognises the sovereign right of a Member State pursuant to its internal decision-making to withdrawfrom the Founding Treaties and to terminate the Treaties for the future. But does this provision alsoempower that Member State, availing itself of this right, to terminate the Union citizenships of its nationalsas well as to curtail the citizens’ rights of others on its territory? On closer inspection, art.50(1) of theTEU does not provide for such a power. Citizenship rights are, as other fundamental rights, not subjectto the political decision of the majority.a. The function of Article 50(1) in its international law contextThis becomes perspicuous when art.50 of the TEU is read in its public international law context, laid downin the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the Convention). Such contextual reading is indeedrequired. The fact that the Treaties are international law between the Member States may be surprising tothose that have been advocating a constitutionalist reading. But that has always been the line of reasoningof the Court. The famous van Gend en Loos judgment of the Court emphasises that the Treaties apply asinternational law between the states, although they also create rights and obligations for individuals.96 Themuch discussed recentAchmea judgment of the Court restates this finding: between theMember States—as96Van Gend en Loos (6/62) [1963] E.C.R. 1, at 12.Revisiting Union Citizenship from a Fundamental Rights Perspective in the Time of Brexit 469[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsHigh Contracting Parties—the Treaties are traditional public international law creating rights and obligationsfor states.97A right of states to exit from the EU was, for the first time, contained in the Constitutional Treaty.98The Constitutional Treaty never entered into force, but much of its substance was retained by the LisbonIntergovernmental Conference and converted into the Lisbon Treaty. That treaty amended the TEU,enshrining in art.50 the exit clause as drafted by the European Convention. The European Conventionwas very clear that it had drafted the clause closely following the template of Part V of the Conventionfor the withdrawal of a state from any treaty, including treaties constitutive of an international organisation.99In its Part V, the Convention creates a template for the conditions, the procedure, and the consequencesof a State Party withdrawing from a multilateral treaty. Article 56(1) of the Convention requires that thesubstantive treaty contains explicitly the right for States Parties to withdraw, or that such right can at leastbe implied.100 The state must notify its intention to withdraw, and withdrawal only takes effect uponexpiration of the notice period, art.56(2). Article 70(1)(a) of the Convention sets forth the first consequenceof effective withdrawal that the Treaties shall cease to apply between the state and remaining parties.However, art.70(1)(b) of the Convention provides rules to ensure that such exit shall have no retroactiveeffect.101 Withdrawal “does not affect any right, obligation, or legal situation of the parties created throughthe execution of the treaty prior to [withdrawal]”. 102 The withdrawing state and the remaining States Partieshave to comply with the treaty after its end.103Against this background, art.50(1) of the TEU sets forth the right and art.50(2) the procedure of aMember State to withdraw from the Treaties.104Article 50(2) also provides the EU with an externalcompetence to conclude an agreement with the withdrawing state on the arrangements.105Article 50(3)provides for consequence of ending the applicability of the Treaties on the international law plane betweenitself and the remaining Member States for the future, following the template of art.70(1)(a) of theConvention. But there is a conspicuous lacuna, in that there are is no provision on the continuing rightsand obligations.It cannot be construed as an implied restriction on Union citizenship as status and Union citizenshipas fundamental right. That lacuna must be filled by resorting directly to art.70(1)(b) of the Convention.The applicability of art.70(1)(b) of the Convention has attracted controversial attention in the Brexit-context,97 Slovak Republic v Achmea (C-284/16), 6 March 2018 at [41] : “Given the nature and characteristics of EU law mentioned in paragraph 33 above,that law must be regarded both as forming part of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving from an international agreement betweenthe Member States.”98Article I-59 of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe [2004] OJ C 310/1, 16 December 2004.99Praesidium de la Convention européenne, Note du Praesidium à la Convention: Titre X—L’appartenance à l’Union, CONV 648/03, 2 April 2003,at http://www.cvce.eu/content/publication/2013/8/5/2551b42a-e0ce-49d4-857a-4325e1154e2e/publishable_fr.pdf [Accessed 19 September 2019]:”Finalement, l’Art. 46 relatif au retrait volontaire d’un État membre de l’Union est une disposition nouvelle.

The Praesidium had the role of lending impetus to the European Conventionand providing it with a basis on which to work.100 Prior to the amendment of art.50 of the TEU, no right to exit was enshrined in the Treaties, and the prevailing literature denied that such a rightcould be implied, see Michael Akehurst, “Withdrawal from International Organisations” (1979) 32 Current Legal Problems 143, 151; R.J.

The ILC Commentaryleaves open as a merely doctrinal question whether the source of that obligation is the Convention or the substantive treaty.104 See Martin Waibel, “The Brexit Bill and the Law of Treaties“, EJIL Talk!, 4 May 2017, available at: https://www.ejiltalk.org/the-brexit-bill-and-the-law-of-treaties/ [Accessed 2 October 2018].105 Further, Christophe Hillion, “Withdrawal under Article 50 TEU: An integration-friendly process” (2018) 55 C.M.L Rev. 29.470 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorseither because art.50 of the TEU is said to derogate from art.70,106 or because art.70 of the Convention isconsidered not to cover individual rights.107 However, a closer analysis of the work of the InternationalLaw Commission reveals that “legal situation” was to be the default clause for rights of individuals createdunder the substantive treaty during its currency to survive. This also applies to the Founding Treaties ofthe EU. In other words, art.50(1) inserts the door, art.50(2) explains how to find the way to the door,art.50(3) tells us what happens when the door closes and art.70 of the Convention explains what the statecan take with it on its way out—and what not.b. The lacuna in Article 50(3) on the consequences of withdrawalArticle 70(1) of the Convention distinguishes the consequences that the withdrawal has for the futurerelationship between the withdrawing state and the remaining states (art.70(1)(a)) and the consequencesthat the withdrawal decision has for rights, obligations and legal situations that were created during thetime of membership of the withdrawing state (art.70(1)(b)). The article now turns to the content ofart.70(1)(b), determining the positions surviving the end of a state’s membership in the internationalorganisation.Article 70(1)(b) of the Convention contains two concepts defining its scope. The first is that certainpositions—rights, obligations and legal situations—become concrete legal positions capable of survivingthe end of the treaty. The second concept is that such position must have been created through theapplication, or execution, of the treaty by the Parties prior to the withdrawal taking effect.108 It is generallyaccepted that obligations of the state continue, if these obligations were accrued during membership butfall due after the end of membership, particularly to make contribution to the budget of an internationalorganisation.109By contrast, whether the status quo of individuals continues has been doubtful.110A canonicalinterpretation of art.70 supports that it addresses the status of individuals through the default concept of“legal situations” that have been created by states through their administrative acts.111 The “rights” ofindividuals can correspond to these legal positions in objective law.The “legal situations” and corresponding “rights” of citizens created during their currency surviveBrexit, and must be respected by the UK and the remaining Member States as a matter of internationallaw, unless the Withdrawal Agreement to be concluded pursuant to art.50(2) of the TEU providesotherwise.112 As consequence, the extant positions of EU27 nationals in the UK and UK nationals in theEU are preserved, and these can exercise their Union citizenship rights for a lifetime. The sovereigndecision of a state to withdraw does not absolve it from the responsibility to still protect Union citizenswho are living there, and neither are the remaining Member States absolved from their responsibility toprotect nationals of that state remaining on their territory.Article 50 of the TEU must be interpreted in the light of the international law of treaties. The explicitright to withdraw extends to the treaties, as binding international law, creating rights and obligations106UKHouse of Lords, EuropeanUnion Committee, HL Paper 125, “Brexit and the EU budget”,March 2017, p.33 (arguing that financial obligationsof the UK do not continue, nor, by implication, rights of individuals). Article 70(1)(b) of the Convention is dispositive and indeed permits that a “treatymay provide otherwise”. Yet, this wording puts the burden of argumentation is on the Party wishing to avail itself of a derogation that it was theintention of the Parties to derogate and effectively make the withdrawal have retroactive effect. But art.50 of the TEU does not indicate such intention.107 See UK House of Lords, European Union Committee, 10th Report of Session 2016–17, HL Paper 82, Brexit: acquired rights, December 2016,p.25, referring to the evidence from Professor Vaughan Lowe QC (AQR0002 and AQR0003); European Parliament, DG Internal Policies, Study, “Theimpact and consequences of Brexit on acquired rights of EU citizens living in the UK and British citizens living in the EU-27”, PE 583.135.108 Sir G.

The right to exit can also be expressed as apower. The Treaty in this sense confers a power on the Member State to terminate the Treaty as betweenitself and the other states.113 But this express right to withdraw and the empowerment of each MemberState has clear limits. It cannot terminate or otherwise affect the Treaties’ bindingness as between theremaining Member States in regard to all Union citizens, including those from an exiting Member State.The state’s power does not reach the fundamental rights of individuals. The express right to withdrawdoes not comprise this element of the Treaties. These therefore continue. The interpretation of humanrights treaties points in the same direction of rights being vested in each individual, that once conferred,cannot be taken away by a sovereign’s decision. Hence, there is no implied right to withdraw from theICCPR.114 Nor must state succession affect those international human rights.115 The involvement offundamental or human rights narrows the door through which treaty exit of a state can proceed.c. The role of withdrawal arrangementsIn the event of a withdrawal, the Convention contains an implicit obligation for States Parties to concludenew treaty-making practical arrangements. These arrangements are to create legal certainty by clarifyingthe concrete positions that continue and by establishing enforcement mechanisms; they may also addressall further matters that the concrete withdrawal may raise.116 It is a consequence of the principle of consentthat these arrangements may derogate from the rule of continuity.117 The Convention rules on continuityapply, unless the substantive treaty itself or the later agreement of the Parties derogate from them. Theintroductory clause of art.70 of the Convention expressly permits such derogation. However, the wordingmakes clear that this will be the exception. The burden is on the state relying thereon to demonstrate thatit was the intention of the Parties for the withdrawal to have such retroactive effect. In practice, derogationfrom art.70, in the treaty itself or in a later agreement, is exceedingly rare.118Article 50(3) of the TEU indeed must be seen in this light. TheWithdrawal Agreement envisaged thereis primarily to create the legal certainty for the surviving rights of citizens, within the then governinginternational law environment after withdrawal, in which all the structural safeguards of the supranationalEU legal order will no longer be available. The March 2018 draft of the Withdrawal Agreement seeks toreflect this standard.119Still, any rights protected by art.70 of the Convention in conjunction with art.20 of the TFEU will besuperseded by a Withdrawal Agreement adopted under art.50(2) of the TEU. The provisions on citizens’rights in the Draft Agreement, which have already been agreed between the EU and the UK, in particularfall short of protecting the citizenship rights of all UK nationals: they only preserve specified rights ofparticular categories of people that have exercised their rights. Possibly theWithdrawal Agreement removescertain rights, rather than preserves them.113For a deeper discussion of rights as powers in an institutional theory of law, see Neil MacCormick, Institutions of Law (Oxford University Press,2009).114General Comment No.26, Continuity of Obligations, UN Doc.CCPR/C/21/Rev. 1/Add 8/Rev. 1 (1997) (no implied right to withdraw from theUN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights).115SeeOpinion No.9 of the Badinter Commission in regard to the succession to the Former Yugoslavia, para.2: “The chief concern is that the solution[to the succession] should lead to an equitable outcome for … the fundamental rights of the individual”, reprinted in D.

It is true that international law would not erect a bar to the partiesnegotiating such an agreement. The bar arises, however, from the normativity of Union citizenship as afundamental right. That normativity implies that Union citizenship survives independently. If theWithdrawalAgreement curtails, then it constitutes a limitation arising in secondary EU law that needs to pursue alegitimate objective and be proportionate to this objective.ConclusionsThis article takes up the debate on Union citizenship at a juncture and takes it to a new, normative level.It chooses not to accept that Union citizenship is merely a status that is conferred on individuals andremains at the discretion of states. Instead, the article has argued that Union citizenship has the normativityof a fundamental right. As such, it institutionalises individual membership in the EU legal order. Thisarticle has spelled out that for individuals with Union citizenship the consequence is that they are includeddirectly in the EU legal order and the once established link must be protected against exclusion from thislegal order, be it through expulsion, extradition or legal deprivation of citizenship. The case-law of theCourt, the Charter, and the constitutional traditions of the Member States and international law, supportthis analysis that Union citizenship is more than at bundle of rights. Claims to protection against suchexclusion are directly addressed to the EU, and not mediated by the respectiveMember State of nationality.The home and host Member States are also obliged to protect the Union citizen, and this remains true fora former Member State. The Union as a polity assumes the role of protector against threats that its citizensface, and which the Member States cannot alleviate.Union citizenship being not just a status but a fundamental right, which once conferred can only betaken away subject to strict proportionality, and not at all by collective measures, implies that existingUnion citizenships survive the collective decision of a state to end its membership in the Union, even ifthe rights contained therein may change. It is the withdrawal situation that pinpoints the coherent conceptionof Union Citizenship in a situation where the collective decision of a state contravenes the rights that havebeen conferred on individuals. Thus, Brexit becomes the prism through which to see more perspicuouslythe individual conception of a citizenship above the state. This individual membership is not conditionalon continued membership of a state in the Union. Hence, it is independent from the collective decisionof a Member State to remain a member of the Union and, consequently, the contribution that the peopleof a Member State are making. While not strictly necessary, clarificatory action by the EU (and the UK)in the Withdrawal Agreement provides legal certainty and thus effective protection against the finalexclusion from the EU legal order that would result from the legal removal of Union citizenship. But thosecitizenships will also continue in the event that no such agreement is reached, operationalised through theinternational law of treaties that art.50 of the TEU references.This normative conception of Union citizenship has consequences and not all of them can be exploredin detail in one article. One is that such inclusion of individuals into the EU legal order generates loyalty.As enshrined in art.20(1)(3) of the TFEU, the primary loyalty—allegiance—is to remain with the respectiveMember State. But a secondary loyalty comes to lie with the EU that protects citizens. As a possiblecorollary of that role, the Union ultimately may have to determine the circle of those that it protects.Revisiting Union Citizenship from a Fundamental Rights Perspective in the Time of Brexit 473[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsContinuity as the Rule, Not the Exception: Howthe Vienna Convention on the Law of TreatiesProtects Against Retroactivity of “Brexit”Petra MinneropVolker Roeben*Brexit; EU law; Retrospective legislation; Treaty interpretation; WithdrawalAbstractThe 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the Convention) is the international legal frameworkwithin which the exit of the UK from the EU takes place. Brexit is not an exception to the rule that theConvention enshrines: termination of or withdrawal from a treaty have prospective effects only and anyretroactive effect on ongoing positions is to be prevented. The article makes three arguments. First,art.70(1)(b) of the Convention reflects customary international law. Second, art.70 of the Conventionprotects rights, obligations and legal situations, and the interpretation of the provision in the context ofits drafting history underlines that this includes the rights of individuals that were created in the executionof the treaty. Third, art.70 of the Convention governs next to art.50 of the Treaty on European Union(TEU) the exit of a state from the EU. Financial obligations and citizenship rights within the meaning ofart.70(1)(b) of the Convention were created in the execution of the Treaties by all Member States, andthese continue after Brexit. A related argument concerns the judicial enforceability of the Convention.The conclusions outline the implications for a holistic conceptualisation of an EU legal order withininternational law and for the law of complex international organisations.IntroductionIn March 2017, the UK notified its intention to withdraw from the Founding Treaties of the EuropeanUnion.1 States changing their minds may be the reality of international relations. However, in internationallaw, conditions and consequences of termination, denunciation and withdrawal from a treaty are subjectto legal parameters. While much attention has been devoted to art.50 of the TEU and its application inaccordance with EU law2 and UK constitutional law,3 this article sets out the international legal frameworkof the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.4 The Convention protects the sovereign decision*Dr Petra Minnerop, University of Dundee; Professor Volker Roeben, University of Dundee.

To that end, the article makes three arguments. Each of these will refutecounterarguments based on the opposite reading of the relevant law.First, art.70(1)(b) of the Convention5 on the continuity of certain positions post the withdrawal of astate from a treaty reflects a rule of customary international law. Second, art.70(1)(b) and art.70(2) of theConvention continue certain legal situations and rights of individuals that were created through theexecution of the treaty during the time of membership of the withdrawing state. Third, the provision isapplicable to the withdrawal of aMember State from the EU, next to art.50 of the TEU. The article specifiesthis consequence for the Union citizenships of individuals. They are protected and continued as createdlegal situations under international law.In concluding, the article advances a holistic conceptualisation of the UK’s withdrawal from the FoundingTreaties within EU and international law, which allows for a lawful and orderly exit pursuant to thereferendum outcome while preventing that withdrawal from having retroactive effect and creating legaluncertainty.I. The applicability of Article 70(1)(b) of the Convention as treaty and customaryinternational lawThe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties was drafted by the International Law Commission (ILC),the UN body with the mandate to codify and develop international law.6 The Convention is thetreaty-on-treaties, and was adopted by States Parties to “establish conditions under which justice andrespect for the obligations arising from treaties can be maintained”.7 It also applies to treaties constitutinginternational organisations, art.5 of the Convention. The Convention sets forth the international law onthe treaty life-cycle, from conclusion and application, to potential termination, denunciation andwithdrawal.The Convention, in its Part V, develops a regime for such withdrawal: a State Party must have a right doso, it must notify its intention, and it must respect a notice period. The critical art.70(1) provides that,upon the withdrawal becoming effective, the treaty ceases to apply to that state, yet certain positionscontinue past the currency of the treaty.The Convention is binding international law, as treaty, for those states that have ratified it or accededto it.8 The Convention binds those states regarding all substantive treaties to which they subsequentlybecome parties. In addition, the entire Convention is widely applied as customary international law.Anthony Aust has noted, that for most practical purposes, “treaty questions are simply resolved by applyingthe rules of the Convention. To attempt to determine whether a particular substantive provision of theConvention represents customary international law is now a rather futile task”.9 There is a strong trend ininternational authority to treat the Convention as a whole as customary international law, unless it is proventhat states disagree as to the law-quality of a certain provision.10 The International Court of Justice (ICJ)has held in many instances that the Convention reflects rules that also exist in customary international5Article 70 of the Convention reads: “Consequences of the termination of a treaty—1. Unless the treaty otherwise provides or the parties otherwiseagree, the termination of a treaty under its provisions or in accordance with the present Convention: (a) releases the parties from any obligation furtherto perform the treaty; (b) does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to itstermination. 2. If a State denounces or withdraws from a multilateral treaty, paragraph 1 applies in the relations between that State and each of theother parties to the treaty from the date when such denunciation or withdrawal takes effect.”6Article 13(1)(a) of the UN Charter.7 Preamble, para.5.8Of the EU Member States, only France and Romania have not become parties to the Convention.9A.

Crawford, Principles of Public International Law (8th edn, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), pp.367–368 (where the Convention doesnot reflect customary law, there it has started the process for customary law formation).Continuity as the Rule, Not the Exception 475[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorslaw.11 A notable exception is art.66 of the Convention.12 That particular provision provides for compulsoryjudicial settlement of disputes by the ICJ. It does not state a rule of customary international law given thehigh number or reservations that were made by states to this provision.13 It is worth noting in this contextthat such jurisdictional clauses in a treaty generally do not become customary international law.An in-depth examination of whether or not art.70 of the Convention reflects customary internationallaw is nevertheless called for, given the critical role of that provision in the present context. The startingpoint is the ICJ case-law on the way that treaty rules acquire the status of customary law. In Nicaragua vColombia, the ICJ found that several treaty rules together may form an indivisible regime.14 The regimeand all the rules comprised therein as a whole become customary international law. The implication isthat if one of the rules that form part of such an indivisible regime demonstrably qualifies as customarylaw, then the further rules of the regime necessarily also constitute customary international law.Nicaraguav Colombia concerned the rules on islands of art.121 of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea(UNCLOS). The Court considered these to form an indivisible regime. The Court was then satisfied todemonstrate the customary international law quality for certain rules in order to conclude that the entireregime had entered into customary international law.The rationale of Nicaragua v Columbia is that at if a set of rules within a treaty form the indivisibleregime over a given matter, and at least one of them demonstrably qualifies as customary internationallaw, then all qualify as such.Article 70(1)(b) of the Convention can be qualified as such an indivisible regime on the continuity ofcertain positions after the end of a state’s membership in a multilateral treaty. Against the backgroundthat the state is released from the obligation to further perform the treaty, the provision spells out that thisdoes not affect “any right, obligation or legal situation”. These rights, obligations and legal situationscomprehensively determine the scope of continuity: if obligations continue, so will legal situations andrights accordingly. The question remains whether or not one of the rules on the continuity regime thatart.70(1)(b) outlines does, in fact, represent customary international law. In what follows, this will bedemonstrated for the continuity of the obligations that the state has accrued during the currency of thetreaty.According to art.38(1)(b) of the ICJ Statute, customary international law arises from consistent andrepresentative state practice, borne by the conviction of being legally required (opinio iuris). The ILC hasrecently clarified the means of evidencing such state practice, and stated that the action states adopt inrelation to treaties serve as such means.15 The founding treaties of all principal international financialinstitutions contain a rule that a withdrawal shall not affect accrued obligations of that state. They providefor the continuing obligation to honour financial commitments accrued before the end of membership.16The major multilateral treaties in other areas of law incorporate such as rule as well. Article 27 of the 1998Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court provides that withdrawal should not have retroactiveeffect in relation to financial obligations and criminal investigations and proceedings in relation to whichthe withdrawing state has a duty to cooperate.17Article 317(2) of UNCLOS provides that denunciation11Military Activities (Congo v Rwanda), Preliminary Objections [2006] ICJ Rep. at [46]; Aust, “Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969)”at [15]-[17], with references to the case-law of the ICJ.12Military Activities [2006] ICJ Rep. at [125].13O.

Significant is the recent practice under the Kyoto Protocol, where theCompliance Committee applied art.70 of the Convention to determine Canada’s ongoing reportingobligations after that state had withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol.22State practice and opinio iuris thus underpin that the continuity of obligations of a state after withdrawalis a rule of customary international law. This rule is part of the indivisible regime of art.70(1)(b) of theConvention. Thus, if obligations continue as a matter of customary international law, so do rights andlegal situations. The next question is whose rights are to continue and how to distinguish rights and legalsituations.II. The scope and the effect of Article 70 of the ConventionArticle 70(1) of the Convention sets forth two consequences of effective withdrawal. Under art.70(1)(a)the treaty ceases to bind the withdrawing state and the remaining states for the future. Article 70(1)(b)then sets out the second consequence that the withdrawal shall not affect “any right, obligation or legalsituation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination”. The provisionapplies to bilateral treaties, but art.70(2) makes clear that the rule also applies to multilateral treaties.23In the following, the article examines art.70(1)(b) of the Convention to determine exactly what positionsare to survive withdrawal of a state from a treaty. It will proceed in two steps. The first is to clarify thescope of art.70(1)(b), and the second step is to analyse the legal effects on the substantive treaty fromwhich the state withdraws.1. Concepts of Article 70(1)(b) of the ConventionArticle 70(1)(b) of the Convention contains two main concepts defining its scope. The first is that certainpositions—rights, obligations and legal situations—become concrete legal positions capable of survivingthe end of treaty or withdrawal from treaty. The second concept is that such position must have beencreated through the application, or execution, of the treaty by the Parties prior to the termination orwithdrawal taking effect.24 These positions have commenced during the currency of the treaty and havenot finished but rather are ongoing after its end. They must continuously be respected to prevent thewithdrawal from having retroactive effect. It is generally accepted, as demonstrated above, that obligations18United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 10 December 1982, entered into force on 15 November 1994, 1833 UNTS3 (158 Parties as at6 September 2018).19Originally: European Convention for the Protection of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, 4 November 1950, entered into force on 3 September1053, ETS No.005 (47 Parties as at 6 September 2018).20Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 10 December 1984, entered into force on 26 June1987, 1465 UNTS 85 (163 Parties as at 6 September 2018). For a comprehensive list, see Gino Naldi and Konstantinos Magliveras, “Human Rightsand the Denunciation of Treaties and Withdrawal from International Organisations” (2013) 33 Polish Yearbook of International Law 95, 107–110.21The term law-making treaty is used here in the sense defined by Crawford, Principles of Public International Law (2015), pp.31–32: “Law-makingtreaties create general norms, framed as legal propositions, to govern the conduct of the parties, not necessarily limited to their conduct inter-se”.22See Compliance Committee of the Kyoto Protocol, Enforcement Branch, CC/EB/25/2014/2, 20 August 2014 at [21] (“Compliance Committee”).Canada withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol under art.27, Depository Notification, C.N. 796.20121 Treaties-1, 16 December 2011.23Note that art.70(2) uses the terms “denunciation” and “withdrawal” as synonyms. Paragraph 1 speaks of “termination” as the denunciation of abilateral treaty by one Party will bring the treaty to an end.24 Sir G. Fitzmaurice, The Law and Procedure of the International Court of Justice (Cambridge: Grotius, 1986), vol.I, pp.403–404.Continuity as the Rule, Not the Exception 477[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsof the state continue, if these obligations were accrued during membership but fall due after the end ofmembership, particularly to make contribution to the budget of an international organisation.25By contrast, whether the status quo of individuals continues has been doubtful.26 The House of Lords’report on “Brexit: acquired rights”, correctly distinguishes between acquired rights under the ViennaConvention on the Law of Treaties and acquired rights under customary international law.27 The latterrefers to a concept which at its heart concerns property rights, acquired under municipal law, and thereport correctly concludes that the concept is to be interpreted narrowly.28 This is the traditionalunderstanding of “acquired rights” in international law. However, we claim that certain rights, obligationsand legal situations continue as a matter of a treaty rule, art.70(1)(b) of the Convention, which is a ruleof customary international law, and that the substantive treaty determines the rights that will continue.That this rule includes individual rights will be demonstrated below. It might be possible to bring thesealso under the concept of obligations of states regarding individuals. Yet a canonical interpretation ofart.70 supports that it addresses the status of individuals through the default concept of “legal situations”that have been created by states in the execution of the EU Treaties. 29a. Created legal situations“Legal situation” is the residual clause to ensure that withdrawal of a state from an international organisationhas prospective effects. States Parties create such legal situations through the acts they perform to complywith the treaty. Once created, these situations continue beyond the currency of a treaty. This rationale isreflected in the commentary of the ILC.30 The commentary cites certain treaties to illustrate what it meansby legal situation.31 It cites art.XIX of the Convention on the Liability of Operators of Nuclear Ships.Liability for a nuclear incident with respect to ships that have been licensed during the currency of theConvention continues after termination of that Convention for a certain period. The ILC also points toart.58(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights, on the continuing responsibility of the state forall its acts capable of violating that convention. The ILC noted in its commentary that different opinionshad been expressed concerning the exact legal basis, “after a treaty has been terminated, of rights, obligationsor situations resulting from executed provisions of the treaty, but did not find it necessary to take a positionon this theoretical point for the purpose of formulating the rule in paragraph 1(a)”.32The references the ILC gives in its commentary for treaties that include a provision of non-retroactivityof withdrawal from treaty for already created legal situations can be buttressed across international law.Thus, the Geneva Conventions stipulate on legal situations of persons after withdrawal. If the withdrawingstate is involved in an armed conflict, then withdrawal “shall not take effect until peace has been concluded,and until after operations connected with release and repatriation of the persons protected by the present25MIGA Secretariat, Commentary on the MIGA Convention, para.73, available at: https://www.miga.org/documents/commentary_convention_november_2010.pdf [Accessed 2 October 2018].26See UK House of Lords, European Union Committee, 10th Report of Session 2016–17, “Brexit: acquired rights”, HL Paper 82 (December 2016),p.25, referring to the evidence from Professor Vaughan Lowe QC (AQR0002 and AQR0003) (“House of Lords report on Brexit and acquired rights”);European Parliament, DG Internal Policies, Study, The impact and consequences of Brexit on acquired rights of EU citizens living in the UK andBritish citizens living in the EU-27, PE 583.135.

Barde, La nation de droit acquis en droit international public (Paris: Les PublicationsUniversitaires de Paris, 1981).29These canons of treaty interpretation are set forth in arts 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention, with emphasis on the “object and purpose” of thetreaty, see C. Brölmann, “Specialized Rules of Treaty Interpretation: International Organizations”, in D.B.

Draftart.66 later became art.70 of the Convention. For the summary records and documents of the intergovernmental conference that finalised and adoptedthe Convention see S. Rosenne, The Law of Treaties. A Guide to the Legislative History of the Vienna Convention (Oceana: Dobbs Ferry NY, 1970).31 ILC commentary, p.265, para.232 ILC commentary, p.265, para.3.478 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsConvention have been terminated”.33 Under treaties on cross-border investment, the withdrawing partyhas, even after withdrawal, to accord to foreign investors continuous protection for the typical lifetime ofsuch investments.34 Some multilateral environmental agreements provide similarly.35 Finally, the arbitraltribunal in Rainbow Warrior36 has confirmed that the responsibility for acts in the (non-) execution of atreaty survives its end. The case concerned the agreement between France and New Zealand concerningFrench agents being held on a French military facility. The tribunal emphasised that the termination ofthe agreement after three years left the claims of New Zealand arising out of the breach of this agreementduring its currency unaffected.b. Are rights of individuals included?The next question is whether legal situations can include individual rights. On its wording, art.70(1)(b)of the Convention continues the rights of the parties created through the execution of the treaty. The ILCadded this clause to address the concern of states that their continuing rights might be denied after the endof a treaty.37 Treaty-based rights of states will thus continue, and this includes rights of states regardingthe treatment of their nationals by another state. The state of nationality has the right to protect its nationalsunder that other state’s jurisdiction. In theDiallo case,38 for instance, the ICJ found so for the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 1981 African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.Ghana, Mr Diallo’s state of nationality, was entitled to respect for his rights vis-à-vis the host state Senegalto which Mr Diallo had moved.39Admittedly, the ILC commentary that the provision is not concerned with “vested interests ofindividuals”, is often quoted to support the conclusion that individual rights are excluded and hence itwould be against the objective of the provision to introduce those individual rights via the concept of legalsituations.40 Article 43 of the Convention is also cited to support this view, however, that provisionprescribes that if a state withdraws from a treaty, this does not affect its obligations under customaryinternational law.41However, a careful examination of the entire drafting history of the Vienna Conventionand the discussion of the various drafts in the ILC reveals the specific, and limited, purpose of thatcommentary on “vested interests”.42 Sir Humphrey Waldock, the ILC special rapporteur, had produced adraft article providing that withdrawal “shall not affect the validity of any act performed or any rightacquired under the provisions of the treaty prior to its termination”.43 When discussed in the ILC plenary,33Articles 63/62/142/158 of the four 1949 Geneva Conventions respectively.34Pars pro toto, the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty, entered into force April 1998, 2080 UNTS 95 (53 Parties as at 6 September 2018), provides forthe continued protection of investments for 20 years after withdrawal of the signature ending the provisional application of the treaty (art.45(3)(b)).Further T. Voon and A. Mitchell “Ending International Investment Agreements” (2018) 111 Am. J. Int’l L. 461; art.72 of the ICSID Conventionprovides that denunciation shall not affect the rights of any national.35 For instance, the 1991 Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo Convention), entered into force 10September 1997, 1089 UNTS 309 (43 Parties as at 6 September 2018). Article 19 prescribes: “Any such withdrawal shall not affect the application ofArticles 3 to 6 of this Convention to a proposed activity in respect of which a notification has been made pursuant to Article 3(1)”.36Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation and application of two agreements concludedon 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair, 30 April 1990, XX RIAA, 215 at[106].37The UK government comment on the earlier ILC draft art.53 had regretted that there was no mention of the obligations accrued by states at thetime of withdrawal, UN Doc.A/CN.4/182 and Corr.1&2 and Add.1, 2/Rev.1&3, 343.

Ascenio, Art. 70, in: O. Corten and P. Klein (eds), Commentary on the VCLT (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), para.24.43Revised draft art.53(1)(b), A/CN.4/L.117 and Add.1 (emphasis added).Continuity as the Rule, Not the Exception 479[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthis formulation encountered the criticism that it included the concept of acquired right already controversialin national law and even more in international law.44 Waldock responded that it had not been his intentionto introduce the “concept of vested rights, in the special sense that it possessed in one branch of law”. Hethen promised a new draft to make clear that the provision covered rights “by virtue of being vested directlyunder the treaty, but not as a result of acts performed under the treaty regime”.45 Read in this context, thepurpose of the commentary is narrow: excluded are private contractual or property rights/interests underthe national law of a party. It is not clear from the ILC commentary whether “vested interests” referredto acquired rights under customary international law. Even if it did, Professor Douglas-Scott, in the reporton Brexit and acquired rights, rightly pointed out that this concept is narrow.46 Thus, only certain rightsthat were created on the basis of municipal law are excluded. However, this does not exclude that thetreaty (from which the state withdraws) itself may also create rights of individuals.This close scrutiny of the discussions in the ILC clarifies two points which are essential. First, it definesa specific category of individual rights (“vested interests”) that are excluded from the scope of theConvention. Even more important is the logical conclusion that follows: a specific rule on what is to beexcluded is only necessary if potentially individual rights are included in the first place. To put it differently,inclusion is the rule to which certain exemptions apply. Hence, the second point that becomes clear is thatindividual rights can be included in the concept of legal situations under of the Convention. Only thendoes the selection of examples of treaties by the ILC become a coherent picture.Such inclusion of individual rights is consistent with the wording of art.70, its object and purpose anda dynamic interpretation in light of the evolution of international treaty law post-1969.It is true that the wording of art.70(1)(b) of the Convention speaks of “any right, obligation or legalsituation of the parties”. Yet that does not exclude that rights of States Parties under a treaty can at thesame time be rights of individuals.47 Furthermore, the object and purpose of art.70(1)(b) is to provide legalcertainty and to secure non-retroactivity of withdrawal; that demands that where the substantive treatyprovides for the creation of individual rights, rights actually created in the execution of the treaty continue.48The dynamic interpretation of the provision over time also supports including individual rights. For theconcept of individual rights in international law has indeed evolved much beyond the traditional acquiredrights doctrine. It now recognises law-making treaties conferring direct rights on individuals against thestate of nationality or against other states. These rights are also rights of the state of nationality, as a StateParty. Thus, in LaGrand, the ICJ found that art.36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Protectionconfers an individual right to receive consular protection by the state of nationality when facing prosecutionin another state.49 In the view of the Court, that individual right was interconnected with the right of thestate of nationality; any violation of the individual right at the same time entails a violation of the right ofthat state.50 A close precedent showing that individual rights created in the execution of such treaties arenot affected bywithdrawal is the treaty onNetherlands-IndonesianUnion.51That treaty exempted Indonesiancitizens from the general requirement of a labour permit in the Netherlands. After Indonesia denouncedthe treaty in 1956, the Netherlands ceased to grant that exemption to Indonesian citizens while maintainingthe rights of those who were already residing. More recently, the denouncement of the East Timor Sea44 ILC member Jimenez de Arechaga, Summary record of the 846th meeting, A/CN.4/SR.846, in ILC Yearbook 1966 vol. I(2), para.63. AccordingtoM. Villiger,Commentary on the VCLT (The Hague: Brill, 2009), pp.865, 868, this was to exclude acquired or vested rights in international investmentlaw.45 Sir Humphrey Waldock, Special Rapporteur, Summary record of the 846th meeting, A/CN.4/SR.848, in ILC Yearbook 1966 vol. I (2), para.8(emphasis added). “Vested interest” defined as “possession, ownership right” is a concept of English land law (Blackstone law dictionary) with whichWaldock presumably was familiar. See Rosenne, The Law of Treaties.

The strengtheningof human rights treaties against withdrawal points in the same direction.53 In a similar vein, state successionmust not affect such rights.54Article 70(1)(b) stipulates that certain legal situations, if these were created in the execution of thetreaty, continue after withdrawal. In other words, the substantive treaty from which the party withdrawsdefines the concrete legal situations that are to survive. The next section explains the relation between thecategories the Convention sets forth and the substantive treaty.2. The effects of Article 70 of the Convention on the substantive treatyThe ILC saw the rules of art.70(1)(b) of the Convention as a matter of legal logic, flowing from the premisethat withdrawal must not have retroactive effect. These rules then ensure that ongoing situations thatcommenced but have not ended during the currency of the treaty acquire an existence independent of thetreaty. Regarding such positions, the withdrawing state and the remaining States Parties are obliged toobserve the treaty in the same manner as during its currency.Article 70 of the Convention as the template withdrawal provision assumes a twofold effect regardingany substantive treaty. First of all, it defines a template. The report of the Working Group of the ILC onthe Fragmentation of International Law55 articulates the rationale of this template-setting quality: theConvention, by governing all treaties, embodies the unity of contemporary international law on treaties.Substantive treaties will usually conform to its template.56 The second effect is constructive. Article 70 ofthe Convention provides default rules for all substantive treaties.57 These become supplementary rulesfilling gaps that the substantive treaty leaves. The practice of the treaty bodies under the Kyoto Protocolin the instance of Canada’s withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol confirms this supplementary quality. TheCompliance Committee explicitly states that, in the absence of any provision in the Protocol, art.70(1)(b)of the Convention determines the ongoing reporting obligations for Canada for past periods after itswithdrawal.58Article 70(1)(b) of the Convention defines categories of positions that shall continue post-withdrawal.It is the substantive treaty that then determines the specific legal situations, rights and obligations that areto continue after withdrawal. The judgment of the ICJ in Nicaragua v Colombia concerning the Pact ofBogotá illustrates this.59 That treaty includes a specific provision for the procedure of denunciation, inart.LVI. It also stipulates a specific legal situation to which the non-retroactivity of the denunciationapplies: “It shall have no effect with respect to pending procedures initiated prior to the transmission ofthe particular notification”. The Court then interpreted the provision on withdrawal and its effects on the52 Permanent Court of Arbitration, Conciliation between the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste and the Commonwealth of Australia, TrilateralJoint Statement by the Governments of Timor-Leste and Australia and the Conciliation Commission pursuant to Annex V of UNCLOS, 9 January2017.53Committee of the UNCovenant of Civil and Political Rights, General Comment No.26, Continuity of Obligations, UNDoc.CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add8/Rev.1 (1997); A/53/40 annex VII (no implied right to withdraw from the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights given the nature of human rightstreaties).54See Opinion No.9 of the Badinter Commission in regard to the succession to the former Yugoslavia, para.2: “The chief concern is that the solution[to the succession] should lead to an equitable outcome for … the fundamental rights of the individual”, reprinted in D.

The Court stated that in accordancewith the rule of interpretation enshrined in art.31(1) of the Convention, the relevant provision had to beexamined in light of its object and context. The Court found that the purpose of this provision was tosecure the continuity of pending procedures that were initiated before effective withdrawal of a party fromthe Pact. By contrast, the alternative interpretation that would exempt most of the important provision ofthe Pact during the one-year period following the notification would be difficult to reconcile with theexpress terms that the treaty shall remain in force during that period.60III. A systemic perspective: complying with Article 70 of the VCLT and Article 50of the TEU when exiting the EUThe Convention applies to treaties constitutive of international organisations pursuant to its art.5,61 withthe caveat that these treaties may contain specific rules for instance on membership or on furthertreaty-making under the auspices of that organisation.62 The Convention thus applies, ratione materiae,to the Founding Treaties of the European Union, which is an international organisation. Ratione temporis,the Convention applies to the 2007 Lisbon Treaty that amended the TEU to include an express withdrawalright for each state.63Ratione personae, while most EUMember States have ratified the Convention, Franceand Romania have not. Yet the Convention as customary international law is binding on all Member Statesin their relations inter-se in regard to the treaties.This external international law perspective corresponds to the EU internal perspective. The Court ofJustice of the European Union (CJEU) has always been consistent in its view that the Founding Treatiesare international law between the Member States. Already the foundational judgment of the EuropeanCourt of Justice in van Gend en Loos acknowledges that the “Community constitutes a new legal orderof international law”. The Court of course went on to explain that these Treaties also create rights andobligations for individuals.64 The recent judgment of the CJEU in Achmea forcefully restates thisinternational law quality of the Treaties as between the High Contracting Parties.65 It also draws concreteconclusions from it, finding that arbitral tribunals must apply the Treaties, including its rules on primacy,alongside other international law, under the rules of the Convention. The Achmea-judgment is a prominentextension of a broader trend in the recent case-law, referring to international law in interpreting primaryEU law in international situations.66 Thus, in Somali Pirates I67 and II,68 the CJEU referred to the UNCharter and the UNCLOS to interpret the EU competence for a Common Foreign and Security Policy. InFrench Guiana Fisheries, it referred to UNCLOS to interpret the EU competence for fisheries policy.69For its part, the European Council, which assembles the heads of state and government of the MemberStates, has had no hesitation in acknowledging that the Treaties are international law to which theConvention applies. It has acted on this view, reaching agreements for the authoritative interpretation of60Question of the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf between Nicaragua and Colombia beyond 200 nautical miles from the Nicaraguan Coast(Nicaragua v Colombia) at [39], [40].61Article 5 of the VCLT reads: “The present Convention applies to any treaty which is the constituent instrument of an international organizationand to any treaty adopted within an international organization without prejudice to any relevant rules of the organization”.62Article 19 of the ILO Constitution on “Conventions and Recommendations” is an example.63Article 4 provides that the Convention only applies to treaties concluded after its entry into force.64NV Algemene Transport- en Expeditie Onderneming van Gend & Loos v Netherlands Inland Revenue Administration (6/62) [1963] E.C.R. 1, 12.65Slowakische Republik (Slovak Republic) v Achmea BV (C-284/16), 6March 2018 at [41]: “Given the nature and characteristics of EU lawmentionedin paragraph 33 above, that law must be regarded both as forming part of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving from an internationalagreement between the Member States” (emphasis added).66Further on the integration between international law and EU law, R.

(1) Itfirst demonstrates that art.70 provides the template for and fills the gaps that remain in the provision ofart.50(3) of the TEU. (2) Article 70(1)(b) becomes a supplementary rule, determining the positions thatsurvive a state’s exit from the EU. (3) The discussion then turns to the relation between art.70 of theConvention and a withdrawal agreement between the EU and the state that art.50(2) of the TEU envisages.(4) The final part of this section addresses how disputes could be settled.1. Article 70 of the Convention and Article 50 of the TEUThe Founding Treaties of the European Union dating back to 1957 did not include an express right for astate to withdraw. Only the 2007 Lisbon Treaty has amended the Treaty on the European Union to thiseffect, enabling a Member State to withdraw from the Founding Treaties. The genesis of art.50 of theTEU demonstrates that it was indeed intended to concord with the template of art.70 of the Convention,including its clause in para.1 lit.b on continuity. The new withdrawal clause was already contained in thefirst draft of the , as art.46 in Title X onmembership.73 The accompanyingmemorandum of the Praesidiumof the European Convention that had prepared the draft states that the clause was modelled on theConvention.74 The Contracting Parties of the Lisbon Treaty which inserted that clause, as a new art.50,into the Treaty on European Union, have thus complied with the provision of art.42 of the Convention,which states that “the … withdrawal of a party, may take place only as a result of the application of theprovisions of the treaty or of the present Convention”.Article 50 of the TEU regulates the withdrawal from the Treaties following the template of theConvention. Article 50(1) of the TEU now confers on each state the requisite express right towithdraw.75Article 50(2) of the TEU requires notification of the intention to withdraw.76Article 50(3) ofthe TEU also defines a notice period for the withdrawal to become effective, of two years that may beextended by decision of the European Council.77Article 50(4) of the TEU governs EU-internaldecision-making. Article 50 of the TEU innovates over the Convention only its fifth and last paragraph.It provides that the state must be formally re-admitted to full membership after its withdrawal has become70The “new settlement for the UK” of February 2016 stated that the decision reached by the Heads of State and Government was legally bindingand that it was compatible with the Treaties, EUCO 1/16 para.3.71Racke GmbH and Co v Hauptzollamt Mainz (C-162/96) [1998] E.C.R.

The European Convention, in much the same composition that art.48 of the TEUnow prescribes for the ordinary revision of the Treaties, was tasked with drafting the treaty.74 “Finalement, l’article 46 relatif au retrait volontaire d’un État membre de l’Union est une disposition nouvelle. Elle reconnaît expressément lapossibilité pour chaque Etat membre de se retirer de l’Union européenne s’ils en décide ainsi. La procédure de retrait s’inspire en partie de celleprévue dans la Convention de Vienne sur le droit des traités, tout en prévoyant la possibilité pour l’Union et l’État membre concerné de conclure unaccord régissant les modalités de son retrait et établissant le cadre de leurs relations futures”.

Dammann, “Revoking Brexit” (2018)23 Col. J. Eur. L. 265.75Article 56(1) of the Convention reads: “A treaty which … does not provide for … withdrawal is not subject to withdrawal unless …”76Article 50(2) of the TEU does not specify whether a notification can or cannot be revoked until the end of the notice period. This gap is to befilled through recourse to art.68 of the Convention. It provides clearly that both notification and the instrument of withdrawals may be freely revokedbefore it takes effect. The commentary of the ILC confirms that this was the considered position. The Commission appreciated that complete libertyto revoke might raise concerns as it was the purpose of the notice period to give the other parties the chance to prepare, but that encouraging revocationswas the overwhelming consideration, ILC commentary, p.264 (art.64 of the draft became art.68 in unchanged wording).77Note that the Convention does not set a default notice period where the substantive treaty provides for an express right to withdraw. The defaultnotice period of one year of art.56(2) only applies to implied rights of withdrawal.Continuity as the Rule, Not the Exception 483[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorseffective.78 This innovation is in line with the proviso in art.5 of the Convention that the law of aninternational organisation may have special rules regarding membership.In its third paragraph, art.50 of the TEU provides on the consequences of effective withdrawal. In linewith art.70(1)(a) of the Convention, the Treaties shall cease to apply between the withdrawing state andthe remaining Member States from the time of the effective withdrawal.By contrast, there is no provision corresponding to art.70(1)(b) of the Convention on continuingpositions. Could this be the derogation from art.70 that the introductory clause expressly allows?79 Onewould have to argue that the omission in relation to consequences of withdrawal implies that the ContractingStates intended that all rights, obligations and legal situations should come to an end in the event of a statewithdrawing. However, it could be well argued that an implied derogation is not permissible at all. Article70 of the Convention states that “unless the treaty otherwise provides”, and the ILC required that theapplication of the art.70(1) would be “subject to any conditions contained in the treaty…”. Thus, theexplicit rule of art.70(1) can only be derogated by another explicit rule; an implied derogation does notsuffice. In addition, there is no indication that the Contracting Parties of the Lisbon Treaties intended toderogate from art.70(1)(b) by way of an omission to provide. Quite the contrary. In all instances, theyadhered to the template of the Convention, from the inclusion of an express withdrawal right to thewithdrawal procedure.Article 50(2) of the TEU, by prescribing that arrangements be made for the withdrawal of a state, alsodoes not derogate the continuity that art.70(1)(b) of the Convention secures.80 The introductory phrase ofart.70 specifies that it continues the positions by default, unless a separate and specific agreement on themis actually later concluded between the remaining and the withdrawing state. Aligned with this, art.50(2)obliges the EU to come to an agreement with the withdrawing state: “the Union shall negotiate and concludean agreement with that State”. Thus, the provision envisages that an additional new agreement be concludedfor the consequences of the concrete withdrawal. Paragraph 3 operates on the basis that such a withdrawalagreement would be concluded and enter into force within the notice period to ensure that coveted legalcertainty. With that, EU Member States expressed their intention to avoid a legal vacuum. Again, this iswhat the ILC had in mind, if nothing was agreed in the treaty, then the subsequent agreement of stateswould indicate the legal consequences.81 It would contradict this intention to conclude that because art.50(2)demands a new agreement, failure to conclude such an agreement extinguishes all rights, obligations andlegal situations.2. The positions created in EU law surviving exitArticle 70(1)(b) of the Convention becomes a supplementary rule, filling the gap in art.50(3) of the TEU.It provides rules for certain obligations, legal situations and rights created during membership to survivethe state’s exit.Which positions created under the EU Founding Treaties fall under this rule and continue? Aninvestigation into all possible positions that qualify in the sense of art.70(1)(b) of the Convention wouldgo beyond the scope of this article. It also is fair to state that in particular the continuing financial obligationsof the UK towards the EU have been accepted by all sides early.78Article 50(5) of the TEU serves to exclude, for the EU, the practice of the United Nations to allow a state back in by tacit agreement after withdrawal,see M. Akehurst, “Withdrawal from International Organisations” (1979) 32 C.L.P. 143, 146–149.79To this effect, House of Lords, European Union Committee 15th Report of Session 2016–17, HL Paper 125 Brexit and the EU budget (art.50 aslex specialis) (“House of Lords budget report”).80 For the reverse relation House of Lords budget report, para.135.81This will be discussion below in relation to the withdrawal agreement. The full ILC commentary reads: “(3) Subject to any conditions containedin the treaty of agreed between the parties, paragraph 1 provides that, first, that the termination of a treaty releases the parties from any obligationfurther to perform it. Secondly, it provides that the treaty’s termination does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties createdthrough the execution of the treaty prior to its termination.”484 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsHere, the focus therefore is on the rights of individuals, encompassed in the concept of Union citizenshipthat have proved more controversial. Union citizenship marks both the objective-law situation and therights of individuals within the meaning of art.70 of the Convention. EU Member States create Unioncitizenships for individuals.82 This Union citizenship becomes the fundamental status of the individual.This protects the link that the Union citizen has with the Union. Further legal situations are created byMember States in admitting Union citizens to their territories pursuant to the free movement provisionsof the Treaty.83 Those provisions generate instantaneous obligations in the sense that Member States mustfulfil them at that point in time. But that host Member State has to continuously respect the Treaty andthe concretising EU legislation in relation to the admitted Union citizen in order to continue the oncecreated legal situation. These are the legal situations that shall not be “affected” by withdrawal; theycontinue per art.70(1)(b) of the Convention.The previous practice of the EU in similar situations indicates full adherence to the rule of continuingcreated legal situations and rights of individuals. In the context of Algerian independence from France,the European Court of Justice had established a general principle that individuals retain their pensionrights acquired in that territory.84 In the case of Greenland’s withdrawal from the Treaties following the1986 referendum in that part of the Kingdom of Denmark, the then Community and its Member States,including the UK, and the Kingdom of Denmark concluded a treaty which preserved the rights of individualswho had exercised their free movement right to work and reside in Greenland.85 The memorandum of theCommission on that treaty explains that these individual rights created during the currency of the Treatymust be protected, in addition to continuing pension rights.863. Is continuity subject to any conditions agreed between the UK and the EU?The Convention contains the expectation that if the treaty fromwhich the state withdraws does not providea provision relating to the future of created rights, obligations and legal situations, a new agreement willbe concluded. These arrangements must create legal certainty by clarifying the concrete positions thatcontinue and by establishing enforcement mechanisms; they may also address all further matters that theconcrete withdrawal may raise.87 The ILC commentary makes clear that any new agreement of Partiesmay prevail.Article 50(2) of the TEU turns this into an obligation for the EU to negotiate and concluds a newagreement on the arrangements for each concrete withdrawal.88 In so doing, the Treaty follows a widespreadinternational practice. Treaties constitutive of complex international organisations typically mandate sucharrangements. For instance, the 1985 Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment GuaranteeAgency (the MIGA Convention) is representative of international financial institutions. Article 35 of theMIGA Convention on the “rights and duties of States ceasing to be members” provides that “the Agencyshall enter into an arrangement with such State for the settlement of their respective claims and obligations.Any such arrangement shall be approved by the Board”. This clause requires a treaty on continuing82Article 20(1) of the TFEU construes the conferral of Union Citizenship as a “ius tractum”. An individual acquires Union citizenship by the factthat a Member State confers its nationality on him or her.83Article 21, art.45 of the TFEU.84 In Horst v Bundesknappschaft (C-6/75) [1975] E.C.R. 823 the European Court of Justice found Regulation 109/65/EEC retroactively deleted thereference to Algeria but explicitly excepted any acquired rights of individuals.85Treaty amending, with regard to Greenland, the Treaties establishing the European Communities, [1985] OJ L.29/1. Article 2 of the Protocol onspecial arrangements for Greenland reads: “The Commission shall make proposals … for the maintenance of rights acquired by legal and naturalpersons during the period that Greenland was part of the Community”. Greenlanders retained their rights through their Danish citizenships.86Commission, Opinion on the Status of Greenland, 2 February 1983, EC Bulletin, Supplement 1/83, p.21.87 Second Report on the Law of Treaties by Mr G.G. Fitzmaurice, Special Rapporteur, UN Doc.A/CN.4/107 (ILC Yearbook 1957, vol.II), p.35,para.6: “The termination of … the participation of a particular party, may give rise to a number of consequential issues. These will … be governed bythe treaty itself if it provides for them, and if not, must be the subject of a separate agreement between the parties”.88 “Withdrawal Agreement” or WA.Continuity as the Rule, Not the Exception 485[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsfinancial obligations, concluded by the organisation.89However, the withdrawing state remains fully liablefor its continuing obligations per art.70 of the Convention, unless other arrangements have been made.90The MIGA Convention also deals with the division of the assets of the organisation in the case of itsdissolution, a matter art.70 does not cover. This provision may be applied by analogy to the division ofassets in the withdrawal of a state.91In light also of this international practice, the principal purpose of the Withdrawal Agreement underart.50(2) of the TEU is to place the surviving positions created in the execution of the Treaties on as securelegal basis as possible, for the time after their currency ends. The withdrawal agreement that art.50 of theTEU envisages will have to provide legal certainty for the relationship between the EU, the withdrawingstate, and the individuals concerned, in the new international law environment. The point then becomesto replicate there as much as possible of the supranational environment in which the citizens’ rights wereoriginally created.The reverse question then arises, whether as a matter of substantive law, the Withdrawal Agreementcan be less beneficial for the created legal situations, in particular, the individual rights of Union citizens?The introductory clause of art.70 of the Convention expressly permits this. Thus, the Convention’s ruleson continuity apply, unless the later agreement of the parties specifies new substantial rules. It is indeedthe consequence of the principles of state sovereignty and state consent that the newly agreed arrangementswill prevail.However, in the case of the EU, such international rule-making has to comply with the higher-rankingprinciples of EU law. Crucially, the normative character of Union citizenship and the related citizenshiprights as fundamental rights set a standard that the Union, the remaining Member States and the leavingstate must respect.92Any limitations to existing and continuing Union citizenships must concord with theirnormative quality as fundamental rights. Even if one were not to follow the argument that Union citizenshipas such is a fundamental right, then standards set by the rule of law in EU law apply to such internationalrule-making, comprising in particular the principle of proportionality, equal treatment andnon-discrimination.The drafting of the Withdrawal Agreement so far seems to be aligned with the presumption that legalsituations of Union citizens will continue. However, a careful analysis of its provisions would exceed thepurpose of this article and might be premature. The drafting has progressed from the outline of the JointReport of EU and UK negotiators93 through several revisions of the text of a Withdrawal Agreement. Thecurrent March 2018 draft94 enshrines, in application of art.70(1)(b) of the Convention, that the rights ofcitizens created by the UK and the remaining Member States continue after withdrawal. It effectivelycopies the extensive body of primary and secondary law on Union citizenship, applying it to those havingexercised their rights by the end of the transition period, and providing the maximum sunset clause of alifetime. Also, following the template of art.70 of the Convention, the draft sets forth the continuingfinancial obligations of the UK created under the current EU budget.89 Such treaty will be concluded pursuant to customary law; the 1986 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and InternationalOrganizations or between International Organizations is not yet in force.

During this period, new rights will becreated on the same terms as those created during the currency of the Treaties. Arrangements may alsoprovide for the permanent validity of the Treaties in parts of the withdrawing state, as the current backstopin the draft does regarding Northern Ireland.Finally, any Withdrawal Agreement has to be ratified by the European Parliament, under art.50(2) ofthe TEU and art.218 of the TFEU, and by the UK parliament, under UK constitutional law.95 That conferson each parliament the responsibility to assess the Agreement for citizens’ rights. Should either reject theAgreement, then the UK would still exit at the end of the notice period, unless the European Councilgranted an extension, but individual rights would continue directly based on art.70(1)(b) of the Convention.4. Settling disputes concerning Article 70 of the ConventionThe rules of art.70(1)(b) of the Convention on continuity are justiciable and subject to adjudication. Thefollowing discusses the several avenues open for states and individuals to judicially enforce compliancewith the Convention. For the remaining Member States and the exiting state to settle disputes there aretwo courts that have jurisdiction—the CJEU and the ICJ. Their jurisdiction is delineated by the timelineof the Brexit process. For private parties, and in addition to this inter-state dispute settlement, art.70 willbe enforceable before domestic courts of the remaining Member States and of the exiting state.a. The jurisdiction of the CJEU over Article 70 of the ConventionThe CJEU has substantive jurisdiction—ratione materiae—over art.70 of the Convention. In its MoxPlant judgment, the Court asserted and since then has maintained its exclusive jurisdiction over all disputesbetween Member States governed by EU law, based on art.344 of the TFEU.96 The Court has also ruledthat customary international law is part of the EU legal order, binding both on the EU and its MemberStates. As pointed out, art.70 of the Convention reflects customary international law. Consequently, theCourt has exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes between the Member States concerning the continuityin the sense of the above-discussed provision. This ratione materiae jurisdiction of the Court over disputesto which the Convention applies corresponds with the personal scope of the Court’s jurisdiction. Rationepersonae, it covers disputes between EUMember States. The Court’s exclusive jurisdiction under art.344of the TFEU will end, though, with the UK’s exit becoming effective. In the process of a Member Stateexiting the EU, the critical parameter then becomes the timeline, the jurisdiction ratione temporis. Undera general principle of international procedural law that is applicable in EU law,97 the Court will continueto have jurisdiction over all cases initiated before the withdrawal from the Treaties becomes effective,which is by default on 29 March 2019.b. The jurisdiction of the ICJDisputes between the remaining Member States and the UK over art.70(1)(b) of the Convention arisingafter the effective withdrawal in March 2019 could be brought before the ICJ.98 Only states have standing95European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, 26 June 2018, s.13, Parliamentary approval of the outcome of negotiations with the EU.96Commission v Ireland (Mox Plant) (C-459/03) [2006] E.C.R.

There are two possible basesof jurisdiction of the ICJ. Member States and former Member States who are parties to the EuropeanConvention for the Pacific Settlement of Disputes99 could agree to submit to the ICJ all international legaldisputes which may arise between them and concern any question of international law, the existence ofany fact constituting a breach of an international obligation, and, importantly, also the nature or extent ofthe reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation (art.1). A separate basis for the ICJjurisdiction are the unilateral and reciprocal declarations that the Member States have made pursuant toart.36(2) of the ICJ Statute for all future disputes.100 The jurisdiction of the ICJ under both the EuropeanConvention and its Statute is subsidiary to specific dispute settlement that the parties may agree to.101Both heads of jurisdiction confer the competence on the ICJ to apply all international law in forcebetween the States Parties to the dispute, including art.70 of the Convention, but not the WithdrawalAgreement, which will be concluded exclusively by the EU and the UK. The ICJ could to refer to it forthe purposes of interpreting art.70 of the Convention, the Agreement being “relevant international law”between them within the meaning of art.31(3)(c) of the Convention.c. LitigationThe situation of individuals depends on the jurisdiction they are under. As long as the dispute arises withinthe jurisdiction of the CJEU, they will be able to enforce their continuing rights under art.70 of theConvention post-withdrawal. The European Court of Justice in Racke has already used the Conventionqua its quality as customary international law as a yardstick for EU secondary acts that would havedenounced a substantive treaty, protecting the individual rights created by the treaty.102 Article 70 of theConvention is sufficiently precise to be directly applicable in the EU legal order, first by Member Statescourts which could then refer any questions of interpretation to the CJEU pursuant to art.267 of the TFEU.Within the jurisdiction of the UK, rights derived from the Convention, as customary law, would also beenforceable under the constitutional law of the UK.103Individual rights arising under the Withdrawal Agreement which will be binding as a treaty on the EUwill be enforceable directly without further implementation measures in the territory of the EU, and theCJEU will have interpretative jurisdiction under art.267 of the TFEU. In the UK, they will only beenforceable based on the legislation that the UK adopts to incorporate the Agreement under its dualistapproach to international law. So far, the Withdrawal Agreement confers on the CJEU the jurisdiction torule on preliminary references from the UK courts relating to the Agreement during the transition andthen for eight years after withdrawal.10499European Convention for the Pacific Settlement of Disputes, 29 April 1957, entered into force 30 April 1958, 320 UNTS 243, ETS No.023. TheConvention has currently 14 Parties, including the UK, and Austria, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Slovakiaand Sweden. In accordance with art.35, the UK applies the same reservations as to its acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ, whichexclude disputes relating to nuclear weapons.100All EUMember States including the UK, except the Czech Republic, Croatia, France, Latvia and Slovenia, have made such declarations, see thelist at http://www.icj-cij.org/en/declarations [Accessed 2 October 2018].101Article 28(1) of the European Convention for the Pacific Settlement of Disputes and art.36(2) of the ICJ Statute. Of course, arbitration under theWA does not count as it will only be open to the EU, but not the remaining Member States.102Racke (C-162/96) [1998] E.C.R.

The first paragraph shall also apply during the transition period as regards the interpretation and application of this Agreement.”488 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsConclusionsThe 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties sets forth the rule of non-retroactivity in law if stateschange their minds, a fundamental demand of the (international) Rule of Law. Article 70(1)(b) providesfor continuity of Union citizenship and the related rights of Union citizens, as these represent legal situationsthat were created in the execution of the EU Treaties. The provision is binding customary internationallaw, and it applies to a treaty constitutive of an international organisation. This rule provides essentiallegal certainty, in the absence of any other agreement of states.This international law provides the normativity for the voluntarist process of a state leaving the EU.Article 70 fills the gap that art.50(3) of the TEU leaves on the consequences of an effective withdrawalfrom the EU, by continuing financial obligations of the state towards the EU and the rights of EU citizens.Rights to move and reside will remain part of the law applicable in the EU long after the UK’s departure,and so will the financing of common interests.The Withdrawal Agreement between the EUand the UK, in its draft form of March 2018, purports tomanage the exit of the UK from the EU by closely following the Convention precept of continuity, asapplied next to art.50 of the TEU. If the Withdrawal Agreement fails to enter into force, then art.70 of theConvention will provide the essential, directly applicable backstop to prevent the legal vacuum of a “cliffedge”.On Brexit, the EU, its remaining Member States and the UK are forming international practice thatstabilises the international law of international organisations and treaties in the critical matter of aMemberState deciding to exit. This practice underpins the confidence that international organisations can be madecompetent to discharge complex tasks, including the movement of persons, and, under international law,provide stability for those trusting in a legal certainty that was created in the execution of the treaty.Continuity as the Rule, Not the Exception 489[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsMediaResponsibility, Public Interest Broadcastingand the Judgment in Richard v BBCSteve Foster*Principal Lecturer in Law, Coventry UniversityBroadcasters; Freedom of expression; Legitimate expectation; Privacy; Proportionality; Public figures;Public interestAbstractThe recent decision in Sir Cliff Richard’s privacy action against the BBC and South Yorkshire Police hasexcited a good deal of moral and legal debate concerning the legitimate expectations of well-knownindividuals and the limits of media freedom. This article analyses the decision in the context of existingdomestic and European case-law concerning the balance between privacy on the one hand and freedomof expression and the public right to receive information on the other. It argues that given the level ofintrusion into the claimant’s private life, and the tactics employed by the BBC in gathering and broadcastingthe story, the case was probably decided correctly on the facts. However, it is argued that the judgment,and its potential impact on the future of case-law in this area, may be damaging to media freedom andthe public right to receive information, specifically with reference to media reporting of police investigationsIntroductionThe recent judgment in Richard v BBC1 has excited fears of a new dawn of over-protection of the privacyrights of high profile individuals, and a corresponding diminution in media freedom and the right of thepublic to receive information.2 The BBC has been refused permission to appeal the decision,3 and thenannounced that it will not be appealing the decision.4 This raises concerns that the decision as it standsmight impact negatively on freedom of the media, and deny the higher courts an opportunity to restatethat interest in the balance between privacy and freedom of expression, particularly in cases involving theprivacy rights of high-profile public figures.The decision of Mann J raises a number of pertinent issues relating to the balance between individualprivacy (especially of high-profile figures) and media freedom and the gathering and publication of news,including the level of legitimate expectations of privacy of high-profile individuals and the role and thelimits of the public interest defence in cases of this sort. More specifically, it raises questions about thelegitimacy of gathering and disclosing details about police investigations, both before arrest and beforetrial.5 These issues are, of course, underpinned by a constant dilemma: the media have an undoubted public* Steve Foster would like to thank the anonymous reviewer for several constructive and helpful observations and suggestions.

The dilemma is neatly summed up by Lord Donaldson MR:“The ‘Media’… are an essential foundation of any democracy. In exposing crime, anti-social behaviourand hypocrisy and in campaigning for reform and propagating the views of minorities, they performan invaluable function. However, they are peculiarly vulnerable to the error of confusing the publicinterest with their own interest. Usually these interests march hand in hand, but not always. In theinstant case, pending a trial, it is impossible to see what public interest would be served by publishingthe contents of the tapes which would not equally be served by giving them to the police or to theJockey Club. Any wider publication could only serve the interests of the Daily Mirror.”7It is, of course, the reaction to that dilemma that will dictate the judiciary’s response to media freedomand the balance between freedom of expression and privacy.8 In Francome, Lord Donaldson MR sees thepress as collaborators, with a duty to report its investigations (on the extent of corruption and illegal bettingin the horse racing world) to the police, rather than disseminate them to the public. Such a view, it issuggested, is wholly unrealistic and indeed inconsistent with the role of the media, which is to report onmatters of public interest, however they are defined, and to disseminate that information to the public.Obviously, in doing so the media must follow the rules of professional broadcasting, but if we start fromthe premise that the media are no different than other public bodies—to serve the general public interestand principally to comply with strict standards on how they collate and disseminate information to thepublic—then the basic tenets of media freedom will be lost.In UK law, whether public figures, however defined, are successful in claims brought to defend theirprivacy and private and confidential information is largely dependent on whether there is an overridingpublic interest in favour of publication.9Richard raises issues other than the application of the publicinterest defence, yet the general tenor of the judgment is formed by the judge’s approach to the desirabilityof the public dissemination of this information. Thus, whilst the author concedes that “celebrity” privacyis important, and should inform responsible and ethical journalism and broadcasting, it will be argued thatthis decision—and other decisions from the domestic courts10—have unjustifiably rejected case-lawrepresenting a justifiable and sensible widening of the defence in cases involving high-profile individuals.11In particular, it will be argued that the judgment is out of line with the inevitable exposure of privacyinterests in today’s technology and social media.The facts and decision in Richard v BBCThe claimant, Sir Cliff Richard, claimed damages for breach of his right to privacy against the firstdefendant BBC and the second defendant police force. The facts were that a BBC journalist had discoveredfrom a confidential source—believed to be someone from the police force who was aware of the policeinvestigation—that the police force was investigating the claimant in respect of an allegation of historicalsex abuse.12 Subsequently, the police had agreed to give the journalist advance notice of a search of theclaimant’s English property and the BBC then revealed that the claimant was being investigated andproduced numerous broadcasts of the search, including the use of helicopters to catch images of the6 See, in particular, the decision of the House of Lords in Turkington v Times Newspapers [2001] 2 A.C. 277.7Francome v Daily Mirror Group Newspapers [1984] 1 W.L.R. 892 at 898.8 See M.

The judge referred to Sir Anthony Clarke’s dicta in Murray v Express Newspapers plc,16where he formulated the matters that should be taken into account in deciding whether the claimant hada reasonable expectation of privacy:“… the question … is a broad one, which takes account of all the circumstances of the case … theattributes of the claimant, the nature of the activity in which the claimant was engaged, the place atwhich it was happening, the nature and purpose of the intrusion, the absence of consent … the effecton the claimant and the circumstances in which, and the purposes for which the information cameinto the hands of the publisher.”17In the judge’s view, the last two criteria were capable of being very relevant to the present case.18 Thejudge found that whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in a police investigation was afact-sensitive question and was not capable of a universal answer.19 The judge noted that previous judicialauthority was not particularly helpful on this issue,20 although he stated that the starting point was that asuspect had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to a police investigation. Thus, it was not, asa general rule, necessary for anyone outside the investigating force to know that information, there beingpotentially damaging consequences of wider knowledge that an accusation had been made against anindividual.21 The fact of an investigation would thus of itself generally carry some stigma,22 the judge beingunconvinced that the general public was universally capable of adopting a completely open andbroad-minded view of the fact of an investigation so that there was no risk of taint either during the13Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch), at [224]. Mann J concluded that that thejournalist hadmisled the police force and the media personnel into believing that the journalist knewmore of the operation and had impliedly threatenedthe force that if they did not confirm the allegation and proffer further information he would reveal the story before the planned arrest.14 It also agreed to pay his costs and paid £30,000 on account of that costs’ liability.15Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [225].16Murray v Express Newspapers Plc [2008] EWCA Civ 446; [2009] Ch. 481.17Murray v Express Newspapers Plc [2009] Ch. 481 at [36].18Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [231]. It will be argued that the attributes ofthe claimant, the nature of the activity in which the claimant was (allegedly) engaged, and the nature and purpose of the intrusion were equally importantto the BBC’s claim.19Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [237]; applying ZXC v Bloomberg LP [2017]EWHC 328 (QB). In ZXC the High Court restrained the publication of the fact that the claimant was under investigation by a law enforcement agencyafter taking into account the confidentiality of the document and that it came into the hands of the defendant via an unauthorised leak.20Axel Springer v Germany (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 6 and PNM v Times Newspapers Ltd [2014] W.L.R.(D) 371; [2014] EWCA Civ 1132.21Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [251]. The judge came to this conclusionhaving quoted the extra-judicial opinions from the Brian Leveson Inquiry into the Culture, Practices and Ethics of the Press, para.2.39 and the Collegeof Police’s Guidance on Relationship with the Media (May 2013), para.3.5.2, that save in exceptional cases the details of arrests and the names ofthose suspected of offences should not be disclosed to the public. For a discussion on these enhanced privacy rights, see H. Fenwick and D. Fenwick,“The Changing Face of Protection of Privacy Rights: Leveson, the Royal Charter and Tort Liability (2013) 27(3) I.R.L.C.T. 241.22Khuja v Times Newspapers Ltd [2017] UKSC 49.492 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsinvestigation or otherwise.23 Further, the fact that there was a search by a public authority that had beenauthorised by the court did not, without more, remove that legitimate expectation of privacy.24Having stated the general position, the judge firstly dealt with the argument that the claimant was apublic figure who had promoted his Christian beliefs in public, and that those facts affected his expectationof privacy. The judge dismissed this on the basis that although a public figure might waive at least a degreeof privacy by courting publicity, or adopting a public stance at odds with the privacy rights being claimed,nothing like that applied in this case.25 The judge also rejected the claim that it was important to considerthat this information had fallen into the hands of the media. Here the judge stated that the quality of theinformation as being private could not, as a matter of principle, be affected by the nature of the recipient,and that there was no basis for saying that a reasonable expectation of privacy was removed simply becausethe information had reached the hands of the media. In the judge’s view, Sir Cliff’s rights were not basedon a reasonable expectation of privacy as long as the information did not fall into the hands of the media;he had a reasonable expectation of privacy full stop.26The balance between privacy and media freedomThe judge then considered the balancing exercise between the claimant’s rights and those of the BBCunder art.10 of the Convention. The judge first considered the supposed “duty” of the media to report onmatters of public interest, a duty which had been stressed consistently by the European Court of HumanRights.27 Thus in Axel Springer v Germany28 the Court stated that:“Although the press must not overstep certain bounds, regarding in particular protection of the rightsof others, its duty is nevertheless to impart—in a manner consistent with its obligations andresponsibilities—information and ideals on all matters of public interest.”29However, Mann J considered the Court’s use of the word duty as unhelpful in assisting the presentcourt’s debate at this stage, reminding us that the duty of the court was to balance art.10 against the rightto privacy.30 Mann J then proceeds to consider the criteria set out in Springer without taking into accountthis overall duty of the press to report. In assessing the relevant criteria, the judge began with thecontribution of the expression to a matter of general interest; the BBC’s plea being that the sexual abuseof children and the BBC’s investigation into it constituted a clear public interest, which was the subjectof an ongoing public debate. However, the judge dismissed that argument, stressing that any public interesthas to be objectively determined, and believing that the BBC was far more impressed by the size of thestory and that it had the opportunity to scoop their rivals.31 This observation is made before the judgeconsiders the claim from two angles: the reporting of the matter as a matter of public interest, and theidentification of the individual concerned. However, when he does address these issues, the judge decidedthat although the information about the inquiry did contribute to a debate of general public interest,32 itcould not be accepted that it was necessary to reveal the claimant’s identity. In his view, knowing that Sir23Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [248]. The judge referred to the opinion ofLord Sumption in Khuja, where he had doubted the trial judge’s confidence that in general the public would know the difference between suspicionand guilt: Khuja v Times Newspapers Ltd [2017] UKSC 49 at [32]. The judge did not refer to Re Guardian News and Media [2010] 2 W.L.R. 325,where the decision was based on the Court’s acceptance that the public would understand the distinction.24Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [255].25Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [255]. The judge referred to Rocknroll vNews Group Newspapers Ltd [2013] EWHC 24 (Ch) to support that finding, although that case was concerned with the protection of more intimateprivate details and did not involve the public investigation of criminal behaviour.26Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [258].27 Sunday Times v United Kingdom (1978) 2 E.H.R.R. 245 at [280].28Axel Springer v Germany (2012) 56 E.H.R.R. 6.29Axel Springer v Germany (2012) 56 E.H.R.R. 6 at [79].30Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [276].31Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [280].32Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [281].Media Responsibility, Public Interest Broadcasting and the Judgment in Richard v BBC 493[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCliff was under investigation might be of interest to the gossip-mongers, but it did not contribute materiallyto the genuine public interest in the existence of the police investigations in this area.33The judge then considered the public status of the claimant and his prior conduct, stressing that in certaincircumstances a person who has placed himself into public life has a diminished expectation of privacy.34However, it did not follow that there was some sort of across the board diminution of the effect of privacyrights.35 Specifically, the judge referred to Axel Springer,36 where the European Court acknowledged thatthat there were areas of the life of a public person which could appropriately remain private, where forexample the material is published merely to satisfy public curiosity.37 The judge agreed that Sir Cliff’soft-stated and well-known position as a Christian, promoted by him, might make disclosures of actualconduct which might be regarded as unchristian something to which he has rendered himself vulnerableby virtue of his public position. However, that did not mean that unsubstantiated allegations, orinvestigations into unproved conduct, fell into the same category.38 Accepting that the publication of thefact of a criminal investigation search warrant might be thought to be of particular interest because of thecontrast between the allegations and Sir Cliff’s public position, the judge also stressed that it was preciselybecause of that contrast that the publication of the material is capable of being intrusive and so damagingto his reputation.39 Thus, the criteria of public status and previous conduct were not particularly weightyin this case and that they did not diminish the weight of his privacy rights in respect of the allegationsdisclosed by the BBC.40 On the question of the method by which the information was obtained, the judgewas critical of the way in which the BBC had acquired it and this clearly weakened the BBC’s position.41The judge was also critical of the BBC’s failure to provide the claimant with a right to reply, together withproviding the subject with some sort of opportunity to challenge the publication, whether by persuasionor injunction.42The judge thus concluded that the claimant’s privacy rights were not outweighed by the BBC’s rights,stressing that the consequences of a disclosure for a person such as the claimant were capable of beingvery serious and required an equally serious justification.43 Although the judge recognised that here wasa very significant public interest in the fact of police investigations into historic sex abuse, including thefact that they involved public figures,44 no public interest in identifying those persons existed in the instantcase. Knowing Sir Cliff was under investigationmight be of interest to gossip-mongers, but that revelationof his identity did not contribute materially to the genuine public interest in the investigation of policeinvestigations in this area.45 The judge also accepted that to a degree a person who placed himself into thepublic life had a diminished expectation of privacy, but that depended on the degree of voluntary surrenderof privacy, the area of private life and the degree of intrusion.46 In the present case, the claimant’s33Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [282].34Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [284].35Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [284], citing Rocknroll v NewsgroupNewspapers [2013] EWHC 24 (Ch).36Axel Springer v Germany (2012) 56 E.H.R.R. 6.37Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [284], citing Axel Springer v Germany (2012)56 E.H.R.R. 6.38Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [285]. Again, the judge stressed that SirCliff’s position might make the allegations more interesting in a general sense, and appeal to the curious or prurient, but that did not justify an invasioninto his privacy.39Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [286].40Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [287].41Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [292].42Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [293]. Although the judge denied that thiswas not an influencing factor in his judgment, and without doubt an opportunity for reply is a relevant factor in judging proportionality, the mentionof providing opportunities for subjects to bring injunctions comes close to bestowing a right on the subject of impending publication to be pre-warnedof publication. This was denied by the European Court inMosley v United Kingdom (48009/08) (2012) 53 E.H.R.R. 30.43Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [279].44Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [281].45Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [282].46Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [284], referring to the European Court’sjudgment in Axel Springer AG v Germany (2012) 56 E.H.R.R. 6.494 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorswell-known position as a Christian might make disclosures of actual unchristian conduct something towhich he had rendered himself vulnerable by virtue of his public position. However, unsubstantiatedallegations or investigations were not in the same category. Thus, although Sir Cliff’s stance on religiousissues might appeal to the “curious” or the prurient, or might provide material for the opinionated, thatdid not justify an invasion of his privacy.47The judge then referred to a number of other factors in the balancing exercise, considering firstly thatthe impact of the invasion had been very materially increased by the nature of the BBC’s coverage, whichhad added drama and a degree of sensationalism.48 Thus, the BBC went in for an invasion of Sir Cliff’sprivacy in a big way.49 It was also very significant that the publication started with obviously private andsensitive information, obtained from someone who, to the BBC journalist’s knowledge, ought not to haverevealed it, and confirmed or bolstered with a ploy in the form of a perceived threat by the journalist tothe police that he would publish the story before the police search.50 Although in his view of less weight,the judge noted that the claimant had not been given a fair opportunity to challenge publication before ithappened, whether that be by persuasion or by injunction.51In considering the severity of the sanction on the BBC, the judge rejected the idea that any sanctionwould have a chilling effect, stating that if Sir Cliff’s art.8 rights were of greater weight, then imposingany sanction on the BBC would not tilt the balance back in favour of the BBC.52 More significantly, heconsidered s.7 of the BBC’s own editorial guidelines, paying particular attention to the need to balanceprivacy and the right to broadcast information in the public interest, and, specifically that people in thepublic eye, in some circumstances, may have a lower expectation of privacy.53 In examining the Code’sreference to the “public interest” in the context of justifying private information being brought into thepublic domain, he believed that the BBC had failed to convincingly relate its broadcast to aspects such asthe detection or exposing of crime and the protection of people’s health and safety. In any case the BBC’smotives were not relevant, as the question whether the broadcast was in the public interest was one forthe judge to decide objectively.54Importantly, the judge rejected the BBC’s claim that it would be criticised if it did not report on thesearch at the time and if it came out in due course that it had known about it. This was not a good reasonfor reporting, although it was understandable that the BBC would have been sensitive about notreporting—given the Jimmy Savile scandal55—that should not have led it to report matters which shouldotherwise have not been reported, and in respect of matters not related to activities involving the BBCitself. There was no positive obligation on the BBC to report; and there would have to be one if anycriticism was to be justified.56Assessment of damagesIn considering damages, the judge stressed that the claimant’s life had been hugely affected for almosttwo years by loss of public status and reputation, embarrassment, stress, upset and hurt, with someconsequential health effects.57 Further, the protection of reputation was part of the function of privacy lawas well as defamation law, and in this case the disclosed information was extremely serious, and disclosure47Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [284]–[285].48Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [300].49Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [301].50Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [293].51Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [293].52Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [303].

Both these aspects were very relevant inthe Richard case and the judge decided both issues clearly in favour of the claimant. What needs to beconsidered at this stage, therefore, is the impact of these findings on the availability of the public interestdefence and, more generally, on the right (or duty) of the media to report on current news items.Before criticising the judgment of Mann J, and other domestic judgments, it is clear that in an attemptto distinguish between what is in the public interest and what the public are interested in, the public interestdefence has been limited to matters which appear to have some genuine political, legal, constitutional,social or economic relevance and thus whether the publication is capable of contributing to a debate in ademocratic society. That question is almost inevitably tied to the question of whether the individual is apublic figure, in other words one who carries out public functions. Thus in Van Hannover v Germany66the European Court stated that:“… a fundamental distinction needs to be made between reporting facts—even controversialones—capable of contributing to a debate in a democratic society relating to politicians in the exerciseof their public functions, for example, and reporting details of the private life of an individual who… does not exercise official functions.”67Secondly, that Court stated that the decisive factor in the balance between the protection of private lifeand freedom of expression should lie in the contribution that [the published photos and articles] make to58Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [345].59 It is submitted that although reputation is certainly part of a person’s private life under art.8, it is unfair to award substantial damages in casessuch as the present, where the information was clearly true, and the media are denied the opportunity to rely on the various defences under defamationlaw: see ss.2–4 of the Defamation Act 2013.60Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [359].61Mosley v News Group Newspapers [2012] EWHC 687 (QB), where the court awarded the claimant £60,000 damages for breach of his privacyrights when the defendant had published details of a private sex orgy he had been involved in, together with photographs.62Campbell v MGN Ltd [2004] 2 A.C. 457 where damages of £3,500 were awarded for hurt feelings.63Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [350].64See Campbell v MGN [2004] 2 A.C. 457.

Thus, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe accepts that public figures must recognise that the specialposition they occupy in society automatically entails increased pressure on their privacy: Resolution 1165 (1998) of the Parliamentary Assembly ofthe Council of Europe on the Right of Privacy, para.6.496 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsa debate of general interest.68 Thus, as the Joint Committee on Human Rights has noted,69 the courts haveattempted to place political and other public interest matters in the public interest category, whilst excludinginformation, perhaps relating to a person’s private life, which the public may be merely curious about.In A v B plc,70 Lord Woolf CJ found that a professional footballer who was seeking an injunction tokeep an extra-marital affair out of the public domain was a public figure and must expect and accept thateven trivial facts could be of great interest to readers and other observers of the media. In suchcircumstances, in his Lordship’s view, the public had an understandable and so a legitimate interest inbeing told the information.71 This view was, however, overturned by subsequent case-law which denieda general public interest in the publication of information relating to the private lives of well-knownindividuals. In Campbell v MGN Ltd,72 the House of Lords found that it was not enough to deprive aninternational model of her right to privacy that she was a celebrity and that her private life was newsworthy.73Further, the decision in Von Hannover v Germany74 had an instant impact on the jurisprudence of thedomestic courts, and in McKennitt v Ash,75 Eady J stressed that there was a significant shift taking placebetween freedom of expression for the media and the corresponding interest of the public to receiveinformation and the legitimate expectation of citizens to have their private lives protected. Thus, post-VonHannover, the public had no right to be informed of the misdemeanours and activities of celebrities onthe basis that such people were role models and that the public had a genuine, thus legitimate interest inreceiving such information.76 In Von Hannover the European Court restricted the public interest defenceto matters of genuine, and more formal, political and public concern; in most cases, therefore, excludinginformation relating to the private lives of celebrities.This distinction, however, is considerably more difficult to apply in practice, and subsequent cases haveapplied the public interest defence to the publication of details relating to the private lives of manywell-known figures in the world of entertainment and sport, and thus have extended the defence to mattersthat are of interest to the public. This has covered revelations relating to the private lives of, for example,footballers, who although not fulfilling as vital a role in public life as politicians and public officials,nevertheless excite public interest in activities beyond their central roles because of their public status.This might, perhaps, in appropriate cases, justify publication of limited material relating to their privatelives,77 accepting that their behaviour was a matter of some public interest because of their additional roles,aside from their status as footballers.Further, some decisions of the Grand Chamber of the European Court have extended the public interestdefence in cases where the individual in question is simply well-known to the public. In Von Hannoverv Germany (No.2)78 the Grand Chamber accepted that the applicants, particularly Princess Caroline, werepublic figures because of their fame. This was because, irrespective of the question to what extent theapplicants assumed official functions on behalf of the Principality of Monaco, it could not be claimed that68At [76] of the judgment.69 Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions, Session 2010–12, HL 273; HC 1443.70A v B plc [2002] 3 W.L.R. 542.71A v B plc [2002] 3 W.L.R. 542 at [11] of the judgment.72Campbell v MGN Ltd [2004] 2 A.C. 457.73This approach appears to be consistent with Convention case-law, and inMGN v United Kingdom (2011) 53 E.H.R.R. 5, the European Courtfound there was no public interest in the publication of photographs and the story, as publication was purely to satisfy public curiosity and was notnecessary to ensure the credibility of the original revelation—that she had lied to the press concerning her use of drugs.74Van Hannover v Germany (2005) 40 E.H.R.R. 1.

Having regard to those factors and to the termsemployed by the domestic courts in assessing the degree to which X was known to the public, theCourt considers that he was sufficiently well known to qualify as a public figure. That considerationthus reinforces the public’s interest in being informed of X’s arrest and of the criminal proceedingsagainst him.”84Thus, following Springer, whilst it seems clear that discussions relating to political figures will attracta greater public interest than in respect of other public figures, the Court is prepared to make a cleardistinction between well-known public figures—whether or not they are politicians or public officials—andthe private individual. Further, having made that distinction it is then prepared to accept that there maybe a legitimate level of public interest in that person’s actions.85 In that sense Springer represents a pragmaticand legally moral acceptance of a general public interest in the activities of persons who cannot be regardedas private individuals, and who cannot expect the media or the public to refrain from investigating andreading material relating to what otherwise would be regarded as their private lives.86 These decisionsappear to establish that although matters relating to these public figures and certain aspects of their privatelives may not be of vital importance and public interest, it is sufficiently so to warrant the application ofa public interest test provided the intrusion into private life is not too great.87The distinction between public officials and public celebrities, and information of genuine public concerncan cause some unfairness where the claimant has a high public profile and where the “private” activity79Von Hannover v Germany (No.2) (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 15 at [120].80Axel Springer AG v Germany (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 6.81Axel Springer AG v Germany (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 6 at [99].82Axel Springer AG v Germany (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 6 at [100]. Furthermore the actor’s expectation that his privacy would be effectively protectedhad been reduced by the fact that he had previously revealed details about his private life in a number of interviews (at [101]).83Axel Springer AG v Germany (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 6 at [91], italics added.84Axel Springer AG v Germany (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 6 at [99].85 It is not asserted that Springer establishes a general (albeit qualified) public interest in the private lives of well-known individuals, as the Courttook into account a variety of other factors, including that the articles about the actor’s arrest and conviction concerned public judicial facts, of whichthe public had an interest in being informed.86 See also Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi v France (App. No.4054/07), judgment of 10 November 2015.87See also the domestic decision in AAA v Associated Newspapers [2013] EWCACiv 554, where it was held that there existed an exceptional publicinterest in the professional and private life of an elected politician so as to justify the publication of a newspaper article claiming that a child had beenborn as a result of an extra-martial affair.498 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsin question may well be considered unconscionable, if not unlawful.88 However, there is a danger that thedomestic courts can be overly influenced by the tactics employed by the defendants, and give too littleweight to the legitimate exposure of unconscionable conduct. This in turn has further weakened the strengthof the public interest defence, with the courts labelling the public’s interest in the information as mereinquisitiveness, and denying any public interest defence.89 This is particularly the case where the privateinformation in question relates to the sexual activities of public figures, 90 where in the absence of a strongand genuine public interest going beyond public curiosity or personal malice, there will be no publicinterest in publication.91 Thus in PJS v News Group Newspapers Ltd,92 the Supreme Court held thatdisclosure or publication of purely private sexual encounters would, on the face of it, constitute the tortof invasion of privacy, and that repetition of such disclosure or publication on further occasions wascapable of constituting a further invasion of privacy; there being no general public interest in the revelationof those details.93 The decision thus reaffirms the approach that in the absence of a strong and genuinepublic interest going beyond public curiosity or personal malice, there will be no public interest inpublication. This approachmay be acceptable where the information in question relates to sexual behaviour,but in cases such as Richard, where the details relate to the investigation of matters of great public interestand where the claimant’s public profile will cause an inevitable increase in public interest, it is unrealisticto treat the claimant as a private individual simply because their activities are not affiliated with any publicfunction.94It is submitted, therefore, that in cases which affect public figures, a strict demarcation between thepublic interest and what the public are interested in, provides too little protection of the public’s right toknow. In Mosley,95 the domestic courts ruled that the newspapers’ tactics and publication weredisproportionate despite the status of the claimant and the potential public interest issues which the articlesreferred to. It is submitted that although the Court was entitled to come to that conclusion on the facts,given the possible unconscionable and disproportionate nature of those revelations, the Court should nothave ignored the public profile of that individual. This would allow the courts to take into considerationthe inevitable public interest in that person and their activities and grant the press a greater, although notunlimited, discretion in the manner in which they research and publish those details. It would also allowthe courts to give greater recognition to the public right to know where they have found that, despite theexistence of a genuine public interest in publication, such an interest did not outweigh the privacy rightsof the public figure.96Turning to the judgment in Richard, the main criticisms of the judgment stem from the judge’s refusalto give due consideration to the fundamental importance of the public interest in the investigation andreporting of this matter, and the resulting dilution of the essential principles of press freedom. The author88Of course it must be stressed that in Richard the private activity in question concerned an allegation rather than a fact; a factor which the judgein Richard makes constant reference to.89 See alsoMosley v News Group Newspapers [2008] E.M.L.R. 20, concerning the publication of details of a sado-masochistic “orgy”. The Courtfound that despite the claimant having a high public profile, and the sexual activities being unusual, in the absence of evidence to suggest that theevents had a Nazi theme or that the participants had mocked victims of the Holocaust, there was no public interest or other justification for the recordingand publication of these private events (at [20]); see S. Foster, “Balancing PrivacyWith Freedom of Speech: Press Censorship, the European Conventionand the Decision in Mosley v United Kingdom” (2011) 3 Communications Law 100.90 See PJS v News Group Newspapers [2016] UKSC 26. Relevant to Richard, the Supreme Court found that the repetition of such disclosure orpublication on further occasions was capable of constituting a further invasion of privacy; there being no general public interest in the revelation ofthose details: [2016] UKSC 26 at [34].91McKennit v Ash [2008] Q.B. 73.

This was despite the fact that the Prince was a pure public figure and the content of the diaries revealed possiblebreaches of constitutional and political convention.Media Responsibility, Public Interest Broadcasting and the Judgment in Richard v BBC 499[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsconcedes that the BBC might, in all the circumstances, have crossed the line between media freedom andrespect for individual privacy, particularly as the information in question was based on unsubstantiatedallegations. However, it is suggested that the judge’s approach towards broadcasting freedom led to adecision which was arguably both unbalanced and damaging to media freedom and the public’s right tobe informed of matters of public interest.The criticisms of the judgment on the balancing exercise can be summarised broadly as follows. First,the judge rejects the idea that the information in question, and the claimant’s privacy, were unaffected bythe fact that the media had acquired the information. Thus, in his view, Sir Cliff’s rights were not basedon a reasonable expectation of privacy as long as the information did not fall into the hands of the media;he had a reasonable expectation of privacy full stop.97 This, it is submitted, fails to appreciate the differencebetween the roles, and duties of the police and the media. Those roles are fundamentally different and itis the duty of the media to have regard to freedom of expression and the public right to know as primefactors in deciding whether to disseminate that information. Thus, in Jersild v Denmark98 the EuropeanCourt stressed that although certain speech (in this case of a racist nature) was not protected generally,the media fulfilled an essential function in identifying to the public that certain people exist and were thusprotected in broadcasting such views.99 To deny that an individual’s expectation of privacy is unaffectedby the fact that the media have acquired the information is surely erroneous; whilst the police might havea duty to keep those details out of the public domain, it is surely not expected—as a basic premise—thatthe media will keep that information secret, or indeed share it with other public authorities.Secondly, the judge rejects the notion that the BBC and the media generally had a duty to investigateand broadcast the material, considering that the European Court’s use of the word was unhelpful in assistingthe present court’s duty to balance art.10 against the right to privacy.100 Accordingly, Mann J proceeds toconsider the balancing criteria without taking into account this overall duty of the press to report. Althoughthis appears to follow the domestic case-law concerning the balance between the respective rights,101 it isargued that ignoring the argument that the claim of the press in the exercise is not only a right, but a duty,fails to give sufficient weight to the importance of the art.10 right when it is being exercised by the media.Further, it appears unfair that, having accepted that the claimant’s expectation of privacy has been damagedfurther by its interference by the media, that the countervailing argument on behalf of the media is notgiven appropriate recognition. Further, the judge found that there was no positive obligation on the BBCto report; thereby rejecting the BBC’s claim that it would have been criticised for not broadcasting thematter.102 This finding reveals a fundamental confusion with the BBC’s argument. It is not suggested thatthe BBC would be accused of breaching any legal duty in not reporting the story, or that the BBC wouldonly be concerned if it was accused of such. The BBC, as part of the media, felt that it had a moral andethical duty to broadcast the story. That is not part of their legal or other duties as yet another public body;it is its duty as a public watchdog, and the BBC is right in suggesting that the public would be very criticalof its failure to report, particularly given the media and others’ failure or inability to reveal even theexistence of the Savile scandal. It is without question the duty of the media to make decisions on whatshould be broadcast in the public interest, and the fact that they may get the balance wrong and be correctedby the courts, should not deny them that special status in the balancing exercise.Fourthly, the judge found that on the facts neither the public status of the claimant nor his previousconduct and views were particularly weighty in this case so as to diminish the weight of his privacy rights97Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [258].98 Jersild v Denmark (1995) 19 E.H.R.R. 1.99 Jersild v Denmark (1995) 19 E.H.R.R. 1 at [43].100Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [276].101Re S (Publicity) [2005] 1 A.C. 593. However, see Venables and Thompson v MGN Ltd [2001] 2 W.L.R. 1038, where it was accepted that thecourts may start from the position that any interference with freedom of expression is prima facie invalid and must be justified within the strict parametersof art.10(2).102Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [313].500 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsin respect of the allegations disclosed by the BBC.103 It is argued that this gives too little weight to bothSir Cliff’s public status (and the European Court’s assessment of that factor in its case-law) and the factthat his position on Christianity would create a natural increase in the public interest in the story. In bothrespects, and in respect of the public interest factor, the judge accuses the media, and the public, of curiosityand prurience, and thus denies—as opposed to qualifies—the availability of the public interest defence.Such a finding is difficult to reason once it has been accepted that the investigations into sexual abuseinvolving high-profile public individuals was a matter of undoubted public interest.Fifthly, and more specifically, the judge noted that the claimant had not been given a fair opportunityto challenge publication before it happened, whether that be by persuasion or by injunction.104 This aspectof the judgment, it is argued, is contrary to the decision inMosley v United Kingdom,105where the EuropeanCourt clearly states that the media are not under a general duty to give such notification, and that UK lawis not in breach of art.8 by not providing the claimant with such a right.106 It is also argued that the judge’sreaction to the tactics employed by the BBC has led to him ignoring the public interest element of thebroadcast and the finding that the investigation concerned matters which were part of an undoubted andserious public debate. Although it is valid to consider press tactics and motives in assessing theproportionality of the media’s invasion into individual privacy, the courts should not be allowed to rejectthe public interest element of the broadcast for that reason alone.Finally, with respect to damages, although the level of the award might not be clearly in breach of thecase-law of the European Court of Human Rights,107 it is submitted that it takes too little notice of thepublic interest nature of the investigation, and too much weight to the BBC’s inevitable desire to broadcastthe story as a scoop. This last factor is clearly evident when, in considering the claim for aggravateddamages, the judge held that the fact that the BBC had submitted the broadcast for a televisionaward—promoting its own infringing activity in a way that demonstrated that it was extremely proud ofit—had caused additional distress to the claimant, and awarding aggravated damages of £20,000 to theclaimant.108 Again, it is submitted that the judge’s findings are inconsistent with the reality of broadcastingground-breaking stories on matters of undoubted public interest and debate, and thus represent an unfairskewering of the balance between privacy and media freedom.109Media tactics, irresponsible broadcasting and the loss of the public interest defenceWithout question, Mann J’s judgment in Richard relies heavily on the tactics employed by the BBC inthe gathering and dissemination of the story. This begs the question to what extent such a factor is relevantin the balancing exercise, and whether a public interest story and defence should be tainted by what thecourt regards as irresponsible broadcasting. That such factors are relevant in the balancing exercise iswithout question, and the recent decision in Ali v Channel 5 Broadcast Ltd,110 has reminded broadcastingcompanies that they need to be careful to balance individual privacy with their desire to inform the publicon matters of public interest. The case is an interesting one with respect to the application of broadcasters’duties to report matters responsibly and in line with privacy rights, and to contrast with Richard.103Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [287].104Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [293].105Mosley v United Kingdom (48009/08) (2012) 53 E.H.R.R. 30.106The duty to give advanced notice can, it appears, be relevant in deciding the balancing exercise, but it is argued that it was wrong for the judgeto place so much emphasis on the BBC’s refusal to give advanced notice.107 Tolstoy v United Kingdom (1995) 20 E.H.R.R. 442.108Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [361]–[366]. The judge then dealt with theclaim for special damages and found that the claimant had been exposed to the risk of further scurrilous publication or adverse publicity which hadbuilt on the original infringement (at [370]–[375]). This claim will be finalised in the settlement that the BBC will negotiate with the claimant.109With respect to contribution, the judge found that the BBC was the more potent cause of the claimant’s damage, and that its breach was moresignificant. Accordingly, the damages for which both the BBC and the police were liable should be apportioned 65:35 as between the BBC and thepolice: Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [446]–[447].110Ali v Channel 5 Broadcast Ltd [2018] EWHC 298 (Ch).Media Responsibility, Public Interest Broadcasting and the Judgment in Richard v BBC 501[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsIn Ali, as a result of rent arrears, the claimants’ landlord had obtained a possession order for the propertythey occupied. When enforcement officers attended the property to evict the claimants they wereaccompanied by the defendant’s film crew, who then broadcast edited footage as part of a series ofprogrammes called “Can’t Pay? We’ll take it away”. The programme was seen by 9.65 million viewersand as a consequence the claimants’ daughter suffered bullying at school. The High Court found that theclaimants had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of the information in question, and that theprinciple of open justice did not justify the broadcasting of information beyond the bare fact of theeviction.111 Thus, what happened when the warrant was executed was not part of the court proceedingsand thus could not be regarded as a public process or event.112 Nor, in the Court’s view, could the impacton the claimants’ children be justified by reference to open justice. The broadcasting of the informationwas not a foreseeable consequence of the claimants’ failure to comply with the possession order.113Although the Court accepted that the programme contributed to a debate of general interest, it foundthat the inclusion of the claimant’s private information went beyond what was justified for that purpose.The programme’s focus was not on the matters of public interest, but on the drama of the conflict betweenthe claimants and the landlord’s father.114 Moreover, that conflict had been encouraged by one of theenforcement officers to “make good television”. The defendant had editorial discretion as to the way inwhich it told the story, but that discretion did not extend to its decision to include the private informationof which the claimants’ complained unless it was justified as contributing to a debate of general interest.115On the facts the balance came down in favour of protecting the claimants’ art.8 rights and the defendanthad failed to convince the court that this intrusion was justified and proportionate.116This finding, almost without question correct on the facts, should be clearly distinguished from Richard.In Ali the claimant was a private individual and the matter being broadcast was nowhere near in the samepublic interest category as the investigation of sexual abuse.117 In privacy versus media freedom cases, akey factor in determining whether the interference is proportionate and necessary is the extent to whichthe broadcast or other public dissemination serves the public interest. In this sense, the Court’s finding inAli that the programme, albeit made for public interest purposes (an investigation into debt), was notfocused was on those matters of public interest—but rather on the drama of the conflict between theclaimants and the landlord’s father—is of potential concern to broadcasters. The Court accepted that theconflict between the tenants and the landlord had been encouraged by one of the enforcement officers to“make good television”—thus reducing the genuine public interest in making and broadcasting theprogramme. This distinction, it is submitted, will be very difficult to maintain in practice, as many publicinterest stories are presented with mixed motives—to inform the public and to score political or personalpoints—and provided the media or other publisher has not lost sight of their duty to inform the public thelaw should offer a defence. In the context of television programmes such as the one in Ali, it is inevitablethat the programme is being made for both informative and entertainment purposes, and for the courts totry and ascertain which of those purposes dominated in a particular case will be both difficult and potentiallyunfair.111Ali v Channel 5 Broadcast Ltd [2018] EWHC 298 (Ch) at [162].112Ali v Channel 5 Broadcast Ltd [2018] EWHC 298 (Ch) at [169].113Ali v Channel 5 Broadcast Ltd [2018] EWHC 298 (Ch) at [163]. It will be argued that this finding should be distinguished between Richard forvarious reasons, detailed below.114Ali v Channel 5 Broadcast Ltd [2018] EWHC 298 (Ch) at [195].115Ali v Channel 5 Broadcast Ltd [2018] EWHC 298 (Ch) at [206].116Ali v Channel 5 Broadcast Ltd [2018] EWHC 298 (Ch) at [195], [203]–[206] and [210].117 See also Peck v United Kingdom (2003) 36 E.H.R.R. 41, where the applicant complained that images of him taken by local council CCTV anddistributed to various news agencies who had published and broadcast the images violated his right to private life. The European Court found that thedisclosure of the footage had resulted in a serious interference with the applicant’s right to respect for private life, and that the reasons for the interferencewere not necessary. In the Court’s view, particular scrutiny and care was needed given the crime prevention objective and the context of the disclosures.Again, it is argued that this case can be distinguished from Richard in terms of the status of the claimant and the public interest of the story.502 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsIn attempting to impose standards of responsible broadcasting on programme makers the decision inAli, and in Richard, are unobjectionable. Such standards are imposed on and by broadcasting authorities;and by the courts in areas such as defamation, contempt of court and indeed in privacy actions generally.118These recent cases take into account that the purpose of the programme is to entertain in reducing thepublic interest nature of the broadcast. Further, certain programmes made by certain companies (andbroadcast on certain channels) will be assumed to have been made for purely financial or prurient reasons.This might lead to decisions being made on unfair or unprincipled purposes, and the decisions in Ali andindeed Richard will be of concern to programme makers who seek to combine public education andentertainment.Specifically, in Richard, the public interest argument of the BBC in respect of the broadcast is lost, notsimply diminished, because of the tactics that it employed in gathering and disseminating the information.This is relevant to the decision on the overall proportionality of the media’s interference with the claimant’sprivacy rights; but, it is suggested, it should not be allowed to dominate the balancing exercise if, as wasclear in Richard, the investigation and broadcast concerned a matter of great public interest and debate.As was made clear by the House of Lords in Jameel,119 the ultimate question must be whether publicationwas in the public interest, and not whether the media have broken the rules of professional journalism orbroadcasting. Thus, in that case their Lordships stressed that the standard of conduct to be applied by anewspaper needed to be applied in a practical and flexible manner.120 Equally, to berate the media forrevelling in its own investigative activities, and guarding the exclusivity of such stories, is, it is submitted,unrealistic and damaging where such investigations concern such high matters of public interest.ConclusionsIn many respects, the Richard case is not an ideal one to discuss the delicate balance between public figureprivacy and media freedom, and to promote the fundamental principles of free speech and the public’sright to receive information in that balance. Given the tactics employed by the BBC and the depth ofintrusion into the claimant’s private and home life the case is perhaps not one where the benefits of mediafreedom can be most robustly argued. Indeed, the case warns us of the potential for abuse by the mediaand the need to protect individual privacy from the media’s tendency to confuse its duty to inform withits own private, and occasionally personal, intentions. Yet, given the unequivocal nature of the ruling, andthe robust attack on the tactics and motives employed by the BBC, the judgment can be criticised forgiving insufficient regard to some fundamental principles of media freedom and skewing the balancebetween freedom of expression and privacy. If that is the case then the judgment may truly have a “chillingeffect” on media freedom and the public right to receive information.It has been argued principally that the judgment gives too little weight to the public interest of the matterunder investigation and the BBC’s investigation and reporting of it. To ignore—rather than qualify—theimportance of that element because the BBC was seen to have acted hastily, irresponsibly and for theirown purposes, led to an unfair balancing exercise between the two conflicting interests. More specifically,it is submitted that the courts often err in placing too much emphasis on the tactics that the media employin reporting stories on high-profile individuals, together with the media’s motives for doing so.“Sensationalist” reporting, it is argued, is inevitable in such stories and should not be used to deny thatthe media are pursuing, and the public gaining, a legitimate public interest in its reporting of such stories.This is particularly so when the distinction between providing the public with information on the onehand, and reporting for purposes of entertainment and sensationalism on the other, are difficult to maintainin practice.118Campbell v MGN Ltd [2004] 2 A.C. 457.119 Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe [2007] 1 A.C. 359.120 Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe [2007] 1 A.C. 359, Lord Hope at [111].Media Responsibility, Public Interest Broadcasting and the Judgment in Richard v BBC 503[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsWith respect to damages, although the level of the award might not be clearly in breach of the case-lawof the European Court of Human Rights,121 it is submitted that the award takes too little notice of the publicinterest nature of the investigation, and gives too much weight to the BBC’s inevitable desire to broadcastthe story as a scoop. This last factor is clearly evident when, in considering the claim for aggravateddamages, the judge held that the fact that the BBC had submitted the broadcast for a televisionaward—promoting its own infringing activity in a way that demonstrated that it was extremely proud ofit—had caused additional distress to the claimant, and awarding aggravated damages of £20,000 to theclaimant.122 Again, it is submitted that the judge’s findings are inconsistent with the reality of broadcastingground-breaking stories on matters of undoubted public interest and debate, and thus represent an unfairskewering of the balance between privacy and media freedom.More generally, it has been argued that the domestic courts give too little weight to the public profileof the claimant when that person is not a public official as such, but nevertheless is well-known to thepublic. In these cases, whilst a distinction should be drawn between matters of traditional public interestand what the public are interested and curious about, there is ample judicial authority to support theargument that celebrities and the like should not be treated as private individuals, and that the public havea natural and legitimate interest in their activities. In such cases, it is argued that this fact shoulddiminish—but not extinguish—the expectations of the claimant, and that this should be truly reflected inthe case-law of the domestic courts, as it is to a sufficient degree in the jurisprudence of the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights. Without that qualification, Richardmay have a chilling effect on media freedom.121 Tolstoy v United Kingdom (1995) 20 E.H.R.R. 442.122Cliff Richard v BBC and The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [2018] EWHC 1837 (Ch) at [361]–[366]. The judge then dealt with theclaim for special damages and found that the claimant had been exposed to the risk of further scurrilous publication or adverse publicity which hadbuilt on the original infringement (at [370]–[375]).

The aim of this article isto present an analysis of the development of the case-law with regard to the relatives of disappearedpersons and to show the current practice of the Court.I. IntroductionDisappearances have long-lasting effects on families, who have to deal with the uncertainty surroundingthe fate of their relatives. Family members experience what has been termed as an “ambiguous loss”,defined as “a situation of unclear loss resulting from not knowing whether a loved one is dead or alive,absent or present”.1 The family of a disappeared person may maintain hope for a very long time that thevictimmay return, and in this sense the disappeared person becomes “psychologically present but physicallyabsent”.2 People, whose disappearance is attributable to the state, find themselves in a particularly difficultsituation. The authorities are not interested in investigating such disappearances and often treat the relativeswho are trying to find them in a disrespectful manner, exacerbating their suffering.The European Court of Human Rights recognises this difficult situation of the families of disappearedpersons and acknowledges that, under certain circumstances, they may themselves be victims of a violationof art.3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which states that no one shall be subjectedto torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.3 The Courts stated in 2009 that: “Thephenomenon of disappearances imposes a particular burden on the relatives of missing persons who arekept in ignorance of the fate of their loved ones and suffer the anguish of uncertainty. Thus the Court’scase-law recognised from very early on that the situation of the relatives may disclose inhuman and*Grażyna Baranowska is a senior researcher at the Institute of Law Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

A Test for Contemporary Approaches to Transitional Justice (New York: Routledge, 2014), p.45.3While art.3 is predominantly applied to persons who have been directly affected by human rights violations the Court has found in a few cases thatthe families of victims of human rights violations may also be victims of violations of art.3 of the Convention, one of them being cases of enforceddisappearances. Other examples include family members who have directly witnessed the suffering or death of their relative (see, e.g. Salakhov andIslyamova v Ukraine (App. No.28005/08), judgment of 14 March 2013), were unable to bury their dismembered and decapitated bodies in a propermanner (see, e.g. Khadzhialiyev v Russia (App. No.3013/04), judgment of 6 November 2008), and a mother who witnessed the detention of herfive-year-old (Mayeka v Belgium (2008) 46 E.H.R.R. 23, see W.

The Court established a number of conditions in 1999, whichsubsequently evolved considerably in the Court’s practice. The aim of this article is to present an analysisof the development of the case-law of the Court with regard to the relatives of disappeared persons andto show the current practice of the Court.II. Enforced disappearances and the European Court of Human RightsThe term “enforced disappearance” was first used to describe serious human rights violations occurringin the 1960s and 1970s in South American countries.5 In accordance with the International Conventionfor the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED), which entered into force in2010, enforced disappearance is any form of deprivation of the person’s liberty committed by the state’srepresentatives or by persons or groups of persons acting with at least its acquiescence, followed by arefusal to admit to the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the person.6The ICPPED recognises as victims of enforced disappearances both the disappeared person and all thosewho have suffered as a direct result of the enforced disappearance (art.24.1).Although the Court uses the term “enforced disappearance” in its judgments,7 it has not adopted itsown definition of enforced disappearances8 and has rarely invoked the definition from the ICCPED.9 Thisarticle includes Court judgments where the facts indicate a possible enforced disappearance. In theproceedings before the Court, it is often a challenge for the applicants to prove the involvement of nationalauthorities in disappearance,10 and therefore the article also includes cases in which the Court did notattribute responsibility to the state. This is often due to the fact that the state authorities did not carry outan effective investigation and did not provide the Court with the necessary documents. It is worthemphasising that the Court itself has sometimes argued that the non-attribution of responsibility to thestate is directly linked to inefficient investigation by the state authorities.11 Moreover, in some cases, dueto the passage of time and its ratione temporis competences, the Court did not examine the state’sresponsibility for disappearance, but only analysed the effectiveness of the investigation into the4Varnava v Turkey (2010) 50 E.H.R.R. 21 at [200].5Report submitted byMrManfred Nowak, independent expert charged with examining the existing international criminal and human rights frameworkfor the protection of persons from enforced or involuntary disappearances, pursuant to para.11 of Commission Resolution 2001/46, E/CN.4/2002/71,8 January 2002, para.8.6Article 2 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance of 20 December 2006 (entered into force23 December 2010), United Nations Treaty Series, Vol.2716, p.3.7See, e.g. Akhmadova and Akhmadov v Russia (App. No.20755/04), judgment of 25 September 2008 at [54]; Khumaydov and Khumaydov v Russia(App. No.13862/05), judgment of 28 May 2009 at [110]; Umarovy v Russia (App. No.2546/08) judgment of 12 June 2012 at [141]; Kushtova v Russia(No.2) (App. No.21885/07), judgment of 16 January 2014 at [90].8For more on the lack of a definition of enforced disappearance in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, see M.F.

Vermeulen, Enforced Disappearance,Determining State Responsibility under the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (Utrecht: Interentia,2012), pp.164–169.9The exceptions in which the conventional definition was mentioned being: Varnava v Turkey (2010) 50 E.H.R.R. 21 at [91]; Palić v Bosnia andHercegovina (App. No.4704/04), judgment of 15 February 2011 at [33]; Aslakhanova v Russia (App. Nos 2944/06, 8300/07, 50184/07, 332/08 and42509/10), judgment of 18 December 2012 at [61]; El-Masri v Macedonia (2013) 57 E.H.R.R. 25 at [240]. The reference to the Convention was ofimportance to the case only in El-Masri v Macedonia, in which the Court stated that “the applicant’s abduction and detention amounted to an ‘enforceddisappearance’ as defined in the ICPPED and in a resolution of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe” (at [240]).10More on that, see e.g. S. Jötten, Enforced Disappearances und EMRK (Berlin: Duncker & Humblot, 2012), pp.132–274; Vermeulen, EnforcedDisappearance, Determining State Responsibility under the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance(2012), pp.235–247; H.

Criteria adopted by the European Court of Human Rights in 1999The Court found a violation of art.3 of the ECHR in respect of the relative of a disappeared person for thefirst time in 1998 in the judgment Kurt v Turkey, which was the Court’s first judgment on enforceddisappearances. The Court referred in particular to the fact that the mother witnessed the arrest of her sonand contacted the prosecutor shortly after his disappearance, who, however, gave no serious considerationto her complaint.20 In its judgment delivered one year later, Çakıcı v Turkey, the Court held that, in orderfor there to be a violation of art.3 of the ECHR in respect of the relatives of a disappeared person, theremust be specific factors which make the scale and nature of the suffering different from that which maybe considered unavoidable for the relatives of the victims of serious human rights violations. The essenceof such a violation does not lie in the very fact of the “disappearance” of a loved one, but in the reactionand attitude of the authorities when they are informed.21 Relevant elements that make those close to adisappeared person victims of a violation of art.3 of the ECHRwill include: (1) the proximity of the familytie—in that context, a certain weight will attach to the parent-child bond; (2) the particular circumstancesof the relationship; (3) the extent to which the family member witnessed the disappearance; (4) theinvolvement of the family member in the attempts to obtain information about the disappeared person;and (5) the way in which the authorities responded to those enquiries.22 In the initial period, the Courtanalysed the applicants’ detailed compliance with the criteria23; with time the Court devoted less and lessattention to it and, from 2014 onwards,24 the Court no longer mentions all the elements but it still recallsthe paragraph of the judgment in which those criteria were discussed in detail.25 The Court’s jurisprudence12 See, e.g. Varnava v Turkey (2010) 50 E.H.R.R. 21 (a complaint concerning the events of 1974 was lodged in 1990); Cyprus v Turkey (2002) 35E.H.R.R. 30 (a complaint concerning the events of 1974 was lodged in 1994); Janowiec v Russia (2014) 58 E.H.R.R 30 (complaints concerning theevents of 1940 were lodged in 2007 and 2009).13 First judgments concerning enforced disappearance against Turkey: Kurt v Turkey (1999) 27 E.H.R.R. 373; Çakıcı v Turkey (2001) 31 E.H.R.R.5;Mahmut Kaya v Turkey (App. No.22535/93), judgment of 28 March 2000.14 See, e.g. Dorado v Spain (App. No.30141/09), decision of 27 March 2012.15 See, e.g. Emin v Cyprus (App. No.59623/08), decision of 3 April 2012.

Some of thefactors have a greater impact on the finding of a violation of art.3 of the ECHR and some are less significantin this context. Examination of the judgments leads to the conclusion that the degree to which the applicantshavewitnessed disappearance (third element) is not relevant. Although the Court referred inmany judgmentsto the fact that the applicant witnessed the disappearance, it is clear from the first judgments that there isno need to be present during the disappearance.26 Circumstances pointing to overly loose links or relationsbetween the disappeared person and the applicant (second element) have also never been the sole groundto preclude a violation of art.3 of the ECHR.27 The other criteria have evolved and there are a number ofquestions as to how they have been interpreted by the Court. The involvement of family members inobtaining information on the disappeared persons (fourth element) will be presented in the nextsection—Part IV. Part V is dedicated to the underage children of disappeared persons. This is a controversialissue in the context of proximity (first element), since in some cases they are considered as victims of aviolation of art.3 of the ECHR and in others not. The attitude and reaction of the authorities (fifth element),which the Court itself considers to be a particularly important factor, will be analysed in Part VI.IV. Involvement of family members in obtaining informationIn the first years when applying the special criteria established inÇakıcı, the Court attached great importanceto the applicants’ active participation in the search for the disappeared and personal contact with theauthorities28 and stated that only the rights of those applicants who demonstrated such involvement wereviolated.29 The Tribunal did not note that the family of a disappeared person can share tasks and somebodycan be responsible for contacting the authorities, somebody for caring for children and someone else forearnings. This has nothing to do with the suffering of the applicants. Moreover, in the patriarchal modelof the family, it may be natural for a man to represent women before state authorities, which does notmean that the wife or mother of the disappeared person suffers less.30There has been an important evolution of case-law in this area. Over time, the Court has become moreflexible when it comes to assessing the extent of close involvement in searches. In a 2006 judgment, theCourt found that although one of the applicants most frequently contacted the authorities, he did so becauseof his legal training, and all the applicants—irrespective of their degree of involvement in theinvestigation—were considered victims of a violation of art.3 of the ECHR.31 Subsequent complaints wereoften made bymanymembers of a family of a disappeared person and the Court, investigating the violationof art.3 of the ECHR, by a large majority, did not differentiate the situation of the applicants even though52446/10, 62244/10 and 66420/10), judgment of 9 January 2014 at [477]; Ortsuyeva v Russia (App. Nos 3340/08 and 24689/10), judgment of 22November 2016 at [100]; Kushtova v Russia (No.2) (App. No.21885/07) at [90]. In those judgments the Court relied on the relevant paragraphs fromthe judgment Orhan v Turkey (App. No.25656/94), judgment of 18 June 2002.26 Timurtaş v Turkey (2001) 33 E.H.H.R. 6 at [96].27 In the rare cases where the Court referred to the fact that links were too loose it also mentioned the failure to meet other criteria, see e.g.Meshayevav Russia (App. No.27248/03), judgment of 12 February 2009 at [123]–[135] (the nephews and sister-in-law of the disappeared persons, in the Court’sview, unlike other applicants, have not demonstrated that the requisite criteria have been met); Dzhambekova v Russia (App. Nos 27238/03 and35078/04), judgment of 12 March 2009 at [107] (the uncle and cousin of the disappeared person were not a close family, and they did not show anycommitment to the search for the disappeared person).28See, e.g. Çakıcı v Turkey (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 5 at [98];Orhan v Turkey (App. No.25656/94) at [359]; İpek v Turkey (App. No.25760/94), judgmentof 17 February 2004 at [182].29 See, e.g. Nenkayev v Russia (App. No.13737/03), judgment of 29 May 2009 at [168];Malsagova v Russia (App. No.27244/03), judgment of 9April 2009 at [133]–[136].30T.

At the same time, thisevolution in the Court’s practice has not altered the special criteria, which have been evoked in the sameform.35V. Children of disappeared persons as victims of a violation of Article 3 of theECHRThe first applications concerning enforced disappearances were submitted to the Court by parents ofdisappeared persons, and the criteria set out above were also established in relation to them. Subsequently,the applicants were whole families, which often included children. Two elements of the criteria outlinedabove do not apply to young children: the involvement in an attempt to obtain information on disappearedpersons, and the attitude and response of the state to these enquiries. It is therefore not surprising that theapplication of the special criteria to the children of disappeared persons is a challenge for the Court.The analysis of the Court’s case-law leads to the conclusion that the Court considers children bornbefore the disappearance rather and not those born after the disappearance to be victims of a violation ofart.3 of the ECHR.36 However, the Court does not apply this in full consistency—sometimes it recognisesthat the rights of children born after the disappearance have been violated,37 or vice versa, that the rightsof any young child, regardless of when they were born, were not violated.38 The Court most often doesnot comment on why it makes such a decision,39 only in a small number of cases this was related to the32 See, e.g. Gekhayeva v Russia (App. No.1755/04), judgment of 29 May 2008 at [118]–[121]; Pitsayeva v Russia (App. Nos 53036/08, 61785/08,8594/09, 24708/09, 30327/09, 36965/09, 61258/09, 63608/09, 67322/09, 4334/10, 4345/10, 11873/10, 25515/10, 30592/10, 32797/10, 33944/10,36141/10, 52446/10, 62244/10 and 66420/10) at [479]–[482].33See, e.g. Saydaliyeva v Russia (App. No.41498/04), judgment of 2 April 2009 at [124];Nenkayev v Russia (App. No.13737/03) at [168];Malsagovav Russia (App. No.27244/03) at [133]–[136].34 See, e.g. Er v Turkey (2013) 56 E.H.R.R. 13 at [95];Meryem Çelik v Turkey (App. No.3598/03), judgment of 16 April 2013 at [90]–[92];Aslakhanova v Russia (App. Nos 2944/06, 8300/07, 50184/07, 332/08 and 42509/10) at [133]; Pitsayeva v Russia (App. Nos 53036/08, 61785/08,8594/09, 24708/09, 30327/09, 36965/09, 61258/09, 63608/09, 67322/09, 4334/10, 4345/10, 11873/10, 25515/10, 30592/10, 32797/10, 33944/10,36141/10, 52446/10, 62244/10 and 66420/10) at [479]; Ortsuyeva v Russia (App. Nos 3340/08 and 24689/10) at [102].

Young children, regardless of whether they were born before or after thedisappearance, are certainly not actively involved in the search for a disappeared person. At the sametime, the impact that disappearance has on children’s lives—especially if it is one of the children’s parentswho has disappeared—is the same, regardless of whether they were born before or after the disappearance.It is difficult to understand why a child two years old at the time of disappearance can be considered avictim of a violation of art.3 of the ECHR and a child born several months after the disappearance cannot.41It therefore seems more reasonable to treat children in the same way, whether they were born before orafter disappearance. If the Court criteria were rigorously applied, the Court could not regard any youngchildren as victims of art.3 of the ECHR. Surely, however, an upbringing in a family in which the fate ofone of its members is unknown is a source of suffering, different from the suffering that is inevitable forclose victims of serious human rights violations.42 Therefore, it would be justified to consider all childrengrowing up in such a family as victims of a violation of art.3 of the ECHR. Moreover, when the Courtreported on rare occasions the reason for its case-law in relation to children, it argued that this was donebecause of non-involvement in the search,43 to which, as shown in Part IV, the Court has paid no attentionsince 2009.By contrast, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights notes the particularly difficult situation ofchildren growing up in families affected by enforced disappearance. As it stated in the 2011 judgment inthe context of children born after the disappearance of older siblings:“Regarding the siblings who had not been born at the time of the facts …, it has been determinedfrom the evidence that they also suffered a violation of their moral and mental integrity. The fact ofliving in an environment of suffering and uncertainty owing to the failure to determine the whereaboutsof the disappeared victims, despite the ceaseless efforts of their parents, harmed the mental and moralintegrity of the children who were born and lived in that environment.”44The Human Rights Committee has not made such a detailed analysis of the situation of children growingup in families where one of the members has disappeared, but its decision also shows that the violationof the prohibition of inhuman treatment applies to all children, regardless of their date of birth.45In this context, the Court’s first judgment in the Janowiec v Russia case, in which the criteria analysedwere applied in very specific circumstances, is worth mentioning. This case was brought to the Court byrelatives of people murdered during the Katyń massacres in 1940, when more than 20,000 people wereexecuted by the Soviet authorities by virtue of a decision of the authorities of the Soviet Union. The crimewas subsequently denied for many decades. The relatives of the murdered people tried to obtain moreinformation in the 1990s and for this purpose they initiated proceedings in Russia, which were finallydiscontinued and the files were kept secret. Russia has been a party to ECHR since 1998, so the complaint40 See, e.g. Taymuskhanovy v Russia (App. No.11528/07) at [122] (the author’s emphasis): “…. It is quite natural that the second applicant, whowas under two years old at the time of his father’s disappearance, and third applicant, who had not even been born at the material time, did not participatein any manner in the search for Ruslan Taymuskhanov (see, by contrast, Luluyev and Others, cited above, § 112). In the light of these circumstances,the Court, while accepting that the fact of being raised without their father may be a source of continuing distress for the second and third applicants,cannot assume that the mental anguish they experienced on account of Ruslan Taymuskhanov’s disappearance and the authorities’ attitude towardsthat incident was distinct from the inevitable emotional distress such a situation would entail, and that it was serious enough to fall within the ambitof Article 3 of the Convention”. Similarly in the case ofMakharbiyeva v Russia (App. No.26595/08) at [102] and Vitayeva v Russia (App. No.27459/07),judgment of 7 June 2011 at [144].41 See, e.g. Dokayev v Russia (App. No.16629/05) at [105]. At the time of the judgment, children were nine and seven-years-old respectively.42Boss, “Ambiguous Loss Research, Theory, and Practice: Reflections after 9/11” (2004) 66 Journal of Marriage and Family 551.43 Taymuskhanovy v Russia (App. No.11528/07) at [122] (judgment from 2011).44Contreras et al v El SalvadorMerits, Reparations and Costs, 31 August 2011 at [122].

In its first judgment,the Chamber referred to the criteria established in Çakıcı and the case-law of the Court, and on that basisruled out the claims of the applicants, who never had personal contact with the men because they wereborn after their loved ones had been taken prisoner.47 As indicated above, when the Court justified itsfailure to recognise young children as victims of a breach of art.3 of the ECHR, it referred to their lackof involvement in the search. Since the complaint concerned only actions taken by the Russian authoritiesafter 1998, there is no doubt that all the applicants, including those born after the Katyń massacres, wereable to participate actively in the proceedings. In this specific complaint, taking into account all the criteriaof the judgment in the case of Çakıcı, the question of birth after disappearance should therefore not haveany meaning. Although the Grand Chamber ultimately rejected the claims of all the applicants for violationof art.3 of the ECHR,48 the reasoning of the Chamber indicates how problematic the Court’s practice withregard to underage children of disappeared persons is.VI. Reaction of the authoritiesWhile adopting the criteria, the Court stressed that the nature of the violation does not so much concernthe disappearance of a family member as it concerns the reaction of the authorities and their attitude whenthe disappearance is reported.49 Presently, the Court often confines itself to this statement and merely refersto judgments in which it has dealt more broadly with the other criteria.50 There is therefore no doubt thatthis criterion is key to establishing a violation of art.3 of the ECHR with regard to the relatives ofdisappeared persons. However, it is not clear from the Court’s case-law how the authorities’ reaction andattitudes are assessed when a disappearance is reported to them.51In several cases, the Court found that there had been no violation of art.3 in respect the applicantsbecause there were no “aggravating features arising from the response of the authorities”,52 or in other46The Court considers the disappearance to be a continuous infringement, so that the obligation to carry out an investigation also applies todisappearances occurring before the cut-off date.

Baranowska, “The Families of Disappeared Persons in the Jurisprudence of the Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia andHercegovina and the Human Rights Advisory Panel in Kosovo” (2016) 7 International Journal of Rule of Law, Transitional Justice and Human Rights21, 26–27. The Chamber was a judicial body set up by the Dayton Treaty, to which complaints could be addressed against violations of the ECHR andits protocols, as well as against discrimination in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by these 16 international agreements. In practice in the vastmajority of cases the Chamber examined whether the ECHR had been violated and applied case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. It istherefore an interesting example of the application by another judicial authority of the case-law of the Court, including on enforced disappearances.For more about the Chamber and its case-law on enforced disappearances, seeM.

Also, in its most recent judgments in disappearance cases of 2016 and 2017, the Courtstarts the consideration whether there has been a violation of art.3 of the ECHR in respect of the applicantsby recalling that the authorities have not carried out an effective investigation into the disappearance caseand that the Court has attributed to them responsibility for the detention of the disappeared person.58 Inthe context of the second factor, it is interesting to note that, although the Court has made it clear in 2013that finding a violation of art.3 in respect of a family member of a disappeared person is not limited tocases where the state is to be held responsible for the disappearance,59 an analysis of the Court’s case-lawpoints to the opposite practice.60 When finding that there has been a violation of the prohibition of inhumantreatment against the applicants, the Court has repeatedly invoked the fact that the state’s responsibilityfor deprivation of freedom has been established.61 By analogy, in finding that there was no breach of art.3of the ECHR, it referred to the fact that the involvement of state officials in the disappearance was notdemonstrated.62 In several judgements, the Court has made it clear that, in the absence a finding of stateresponsibility for the disappearance: “the Court is not persuaded that the investigating authorities’ conduct…. could have in itself caused the applicants mental distress in excess of the minimum level of severitywhich is necessary in order to consider treatment as falling within the scope of Article 3”.63 An exceptionworth recalling is the 2008 judgment in theOsmanoğlu v Turkey case, in which the Court found a violationof art.3 of the ECHR in respect of the father of a disappeared man64 despite the fact that the Court was notin a position to establish whether the individuals who arrested his son were in fact police officers.

However, this practice has not been subsequentlyadopted by the Court in its case-law.It is worth mentioning, that in many cases of enforced disappearances, the Court finds that there hasbeen a violation of its obligations under art.38 of the ECHR, mainly due to the failure to provide it withthe documents requested by the Court.66 The Court does not take into account that the conduct of theauthorities during proceedings before the Court itself can lead to the aggravation of the suffering of theloved ones of a disappeared person. The relatives of the disappeared persons suffer from uncertainty asto the fate of the disappeared person and the authorities of the state may have information that could putan end to their suffering. If they do not provide the applicants or the ECHR with the requested documentsand, at the same time, are not able to convincingly justify their refusal, they directly contribute to thefurther suffering of the relatives of the disappeared persons.67VII. ConclusionsIn its practice, the Court has found that relatives of disappeared persons may be victims of a breach ofart.3 of the ECHR. The adopted criteria have evolved, with more and more people covered over time. Forexample, while the Court initially examined in great detail the involvement of individual applicants in thesearch for the disappeared persons and in contact with the authorities and considered as victims of inhumantreatment only those who were active in this area, it does not currently pay any attention to this aspect.There are a number of inconsistencies in the case-law under analysis. For example, in most cases, childrenborn shortly before the disappearance of a family member are regarded as victims of a violation of art.3of the ECHR, but there are also judgments in which the Court has taken reverse decisions. As indicatedabove, the different treatment of children born before and after disappearance raises serious doubts. Anotherexample of inconsistencies is the recognition of the victims of inhuman treatment of relatives of personswhose disappearance was not attributed to the state by the Court. The Court has made it clear that in sucha situation, art.3 of the ECHR may be violated, but has adopted the opposite practice. Finally, the Courtconsiders that the nature of the breach is the reaction of the authorities and their attitude whendisappearances are reported to them. However, the Court jurisprudence does not show how the Courtassesses the authorities’ reaction and attitudes when disappearances are reported to them.The ICPPED, which entered into force in 2010, is the first international agreement explicitly recognisingrelatives of a disappeared person also as victims of enforced disappearances. The Court could thereforetreat this as a starting point for changing its case-law in such a way as to recognise the difficult situationof all the relatives of disappeared persons. This has long been the practice of other international bodies.For example, the Human Rights Committee does not apply any criteria and, from the very first cases underconsideration, states that relatives of disappeared persons are treated inhumanly because they were entitledto know the truth about the fate of disappeared persons.68 The basis for their recognition as victims of theInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights’ violation is therefore the mere fact that the authoritieshave not informed the authorities of the fate of the disappeared person, which is an inseparable element65Osmanoğlu v Turkey (App. No.48804/99) at [53].66 Jötten, Enforced Disappearances und EMRK (Berlin: Duncker & Humblot, 2012), p.229.67An especially striking example is the case Janowiec v Russia (2014) 58 E.H.R.R 30, in which the Court held only and exclusively an infringementof art.38 of the ECHR by Russia. While Russia’s conduct during the proceedings before the Court could certainly lead to an aggravating of the sufferingof the applicants, this subject was not examined by the Court.68Communication No.107/1981, Quinteros v Urugwaj, Views adopted by the Committee on 21 July 1983 at [14]; Communication No.1085/2002,Bousroual v Algeria, Views adopted by the Committee on 15 March 2006 at [9.8]; Communication No.950/2000, Sarma v Sri Lanka, Views adoptedby the Committee on 16 July 2003 at [9.5]; Communication No.1327/2004, Grioua v Algieria, Views adopted by the Committee on 10 July 2007 at[7.7].Families of Disappeared Persons in the Jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights 513[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsof the enforced disappearances. Another possibility to recognise the difficult situation of the next-of-kinto disappeared persons would be to consider them as victims of a violation of art.8 of the ECHR, whichguarantees the right to respect for private and family life.69 This has been raised by many applicants in theanalysed cases.70 However, the Court only recognised this in very few cases where, in addition todisappearance, other violations of the ECHR have occurred.71 The Court has therefore many possibilitiesto change its case-law in order to acknowledge the different situations of all of the family members of adisappeared person: relying on other ECHR provisions, invoking international jurisprudence or raisingrights contained in a new international treaty. No matter how the case-law evolves, if the Court reallywants to recognise the “particular burden on the relatives of missing persons”72 it should introduce somechanges to its current practice.69This appraoch was adopted by Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Hercegovina (cf. e.g. CH/01/8365 et al., Selimović v The Republika Srpska,decision on admissibility and merits of 3 March 2003 at [179]–[181]).70 See, e.g. Şeker v Turkey (App. No.52390/99) at [85]; Luluyev v Russia (2009) 48 E.H.H.R. 45 at [131]; Ibragimov v Russia (App. No.34561/03),judgment of 29 May 2008 at [118]; Osmano?lu v Turkey (App. No.48804/99) at [105]; Ruslan Umarov v Russia (App. No.12712/02), judgment of 3July 2008 at [136]; Lyanova and Aliyeva v Russia (App. Nos 12713/02 and 28440/03), judgment of 2 October 2008 at [127]; see also Jötten, EnforcedDisappearances und EMRK (Berlin: Duncker & Humblot, 2012), pp.66–67. The applicants started to invoke an infringement of art.8 of the ECHRfollowing decisions of the Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina.71 For example, there were no legal regulations concerning the contact between the detained person and his or her family and the father was notallowed to contact his detained son: Uçar v Turkey (App. No.52392/99), judgment of 11 April 2006 at [130]–[141].72Varnava v Turkey (2010) 50 E.H.R.R. 21 at [200].514 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCase and CommentSelected decisions from the European Court of Human Rights for May andJune 2018Editor: Dr Sofia Galani, Lecturer in Law, Human Rights Implementation Centre, University of BristolLaw School.Contributors: Richard Costidell, Christopher Gray, Kaj Hadad, Lucie Laffont, AnthonyMorelli, JordanOwen, Alice Venn, Jennyfer Vervisch (University of Bristol).Note on Court judgments: European Court judgments can be delivered by a Grand Chamber of 17judges, a chamber of seven judges from one of the Court’s five sections or, where the issue is already thesubject of well-established case-law, by a committee of three judges from one of the sections.

This newsletter critically covered the events of the Chechen civil war whichlasted from 1999 to 2009. It notably accused the Russian regime to “[wage] a war aimed at the physicalextermination of Chechens as an ethnic group”. In 2004, the applicant participated in an unauthorisedmeeting in protest of the current regime. He also disseminated issues of the newsletter during a meetingin Moscow. A criminal investigation was launched against him on suspicion that the views expressed inthe newsletter amounted to appeals to extremist activities and incitement to racial, national, social andother hatred. In a judgment of 20 November 2006, the District Court convicted him of “having publiclyappealed to extremist activities through the mass media” and of having committed “actions aimed atinciting hatred and enmity as well as at humiliating the dignity of an individual or group of individualson the grounds of ethnicity, origin, attitude towards religion and membership of a social group, throughthe mass media”, according to the Russian Criminal Code. The domestic court relied on the language usedin the newsletter to conclude that the applicant’s actions constituted criminal offences and that he had515[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsabused his right of freedom of expression secured by the Russian Constitution.Mr Stomakhin was sentencedto five years’ imprisonment and was banned from practising journalism for three years. The judgmentwas upheld by the Moscow City Court on appeal.The applicant complained before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) on the grounds ofviolations of his right to freedom of expression under art.10 and his right to freedom of peaceful assemblyunder art.11 of the Convention. When the case was examined by the Court, the applicant had completedhis sentence.Held(1) The Court deemed it appropriate to examine the complaint within the scope of art.10 only.It declared the remainder of the complaint inadmissible (unanimous).(2) There had been a violation of art.10 of the Convention (unanimous).In assessing whether the interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expressionpursued a legitimate aim, the Court noted the difficult situation in the Chechen Republicand the existence of an illegal insurgency in the region. In the light of these circumstances,the applicant’s conviction pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the rights of others,national security, public safety and public order. In order to determine whether theinterference had been “necessary in a democratic society” and whether the applicant’sconviction answered a “pressing social need”, the Court divided its reasoning in three groupsof statements. The first group concerned the newsletter statements which appealed to extremistactivities. The wording of the texts glorified the violent methods of action of the Chechenseparatists, including terrorist attacks which had resulted in the deaths of innocent people.The Court noted that some of the impugned extracts rejected democratic principles, such asthe respect for the Constitution and openly called to violent uprising and armed resistance.It reiterated its well-established case-law according to which the limits of permissible criticismare wider with regard to the government than in relation to a private individual or even apolitician, and the mere facts that forms of expression offend, shock or disturb does notsuffice to justify the interference with one’s right to freedom of expression. However, in thepresent case, the criticism went far beyond what is acceptable in a democratic society andamounted to glorification of terrorism and deadly violence. Moreover, Russian armed andsecurity forces were accused of serious violations, such as mass murder or torture. Whilethe Court had previously found Russia responsible for such abuses in previous cases, thewording of the impugned text aimed at stigmatising and dehumanising Russian servicemenas a whole and incited hatred against them. In the light of the above findings, the Courtconcluded that there was a “pressing social need” to interfere with the applicant’s right tofreedom of expression. It reached the same conclusion for the third group of statements,which had generalised isolated cases of alleged abuses as representative of ethnic Russiansand Orthodox believers, such as the keeping of slaves. Whilst the Court said that there islittle scope under art.10(2) for restrictions on political speech and on debate of questions ofpublic interest, the margin of appreciation is wider when it comes to regulating freedom ofexpression in relation to matters liable to offend intimate personal convictions within thesphere of morals or, especially, religion. The second group of statements described theactions of Russian authorities in the Chechen Republic as a “totally destructive genocidalwar against the Chechen people”. They notably called people to abstain from participatingin the presidential election of March 2004. The Court deemed that the domestic courts’conclusion that such statements amounted to appeals to extremist activities were not “relevantand sufficient” to justify the interference with the applicant’s exercise of freedom of516 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsexpression. Seeking the truth and starting a debate on the causes of serious abuses whichamount to war crimes or crimes against humanity constitute an integral part of freedom ofexpression. Therefore, domestic authorities should adopt a cautious approach in determiningthe scope of “hate speech”, especially when it comes to mere criticism of the state.Consequently, the Court held that the applicant’s conviction did not meet a “social pressingneed” in respect of the second group of statements. Furthermore, the Court reached theconclusion that the conviction had not been proportionate with the legitimate aim pursued.Given that the applicant had no criminal record and the newsletter had had a limited impactin terms of dissemination of information, sentencing the applicant to five years ofimprisonment coupled with a three-year ban on practising journalism was a particularlyharsh measure.(3) The Court rejected the claim for pecuniary damage in respect of the applicant’s loss ofearnings for the five years in which he was in prison. However, it awarded the applicant€12,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage (four votes to three).(4) It rejected the applicant’s claim of €3,000 for the cost and expenses incurred before theCourt (six votes to one).Cases consideredAkhmadov v Russia (App. No.21586/02), (2011) 52 E.H.R.R. 17Bédat v Switzerland [GC] (App. No.56925/08), (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 15Belge v Turkey (App. No.50171/09), judgment of 6 December 2016Ceylan v Turkey [GC] (2000) 30 E.H.R.R. 73Chauvy v France (2005) 41 E.H.R.R. 29Chitayev v Russia (App. No.59334/00), (2008) 47 E.H.R.R. 1Dlugolecki v Poland (App. No.23806/03), judgment of 24 February 2009Dmitriyevskiy v Russia (App. No.42168/06), judgment of 3 October 2017Erdogdu v Turkey [GC] (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 50Esmukhambetov v Russia (App. No.23445/03), judgment of 29 March 2011Estamirov v Russia (App. No.60272/00), (2008) 46 E.H.R.R. 33Fatullayev v Azerbaijan (2011) 52 E.H.R.R. 2Féret v Belgium (App. No.15615/07), judgment of 6 July 2009Gerger v Turkey [GC] (App. No.24919/94), judgment of 8 July 1999Goncharuk v Russia (App. No.5864/00), judgment of 4 October 2007Gormüs v Turkey (App. No.49085/07), judgment of 19 January 2016Gough v United Kindgom (2015) 61 E.H.R.R. 8Gül v Turkey (App. No.4870/02), (2011) 52 E.H.R.R. 38Günduz v Turkey (2005) 41 E.H.R.R. 5Karatas v Turkey [GC] (App. No.23168/94), judgment of 8 July 1999Kerimova v Russia (App. No.17170/04), judgment of 3 May 2011Khashiyev and Akayeva v Russia (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 20Leroy v France (App. No.36109/03), judgment of 2 October 2008Mamère v France (2009) 49 E.H.R.R.39Morice v France [GC] (2016) 62 E.H.R.R. 1Murphy v Ireland (2004) 38 E.H.R.R. 13Novikova v Russia (App. No.25501/07), judgment of 26 April 2016Okçuoglu v Turkey [GC] (App. No.24246/94), judgment of 8 July 1999Osmani v Macedonia (dec.)

As noted by Judge Keller in the concurring opinion, the casemarks the beginning of a body of case-law not only in relation to Russia, but also in relation to otherContracting Parties. Many states in the Council of Europe are affected by terrorism. Moreover, separatistmovements have increasingly emerged. It is thus essential that the Court delineates the limits of whatconstitutes acceptable criticism in such sensitive circumstances.This judgment is important in that it limits the margin of appreciation enjoyed by Contracting Partiesin relation to restrictions of “hate speech”. The context in which the impugned statements had beenformulated was particularly sensitive, i.e. the ongoing civil war in the Chechen Republic, the Russianregime policies in that region, and the events that occurred outside of the Chechen territory, such as thetaking of hostages by Chechen separatists in the Moscow theatre which ended by a military operation andresulted in the death of 129 hostages. The Court recognised that in cases of conflict governments have tobe vigilant regarding the use of media that disseminate hate speech and promote violence against the state.However, the Court reiterated that a fair balance should be struck between the individual’s fundamentalrights to freedom of expression and a democratic society’s legitimate right to protect itself against theactivities of terrorist organisations.The Court insisted that not all forms of criticism are to be considered as “hate speech”, especially whenthe recipient is the government, and clarified what forms of expression go beyond what is acceptable ina democratic society. At a time where freedom of the press is under tension in several European countries,the democratic values underlying freedom of expression, such as the possibility to freely “seek historicaltruth” or to start “a debate on the causes of acts of particular gravity” are of prime importance. The Court’swarning that domestic authorities should be cautious when determining the scope of “hate speech” crimesis certainly not only addressed to Russia, but also to other countries such as Turkey, where the governmenthas undertaken a purge on media after the failed coup d’état in 2016.The impact of Stomakhin v Russia on future case-law is indisputable. However, Judge Keller disagreedwith the majority’s classification of the impugned statements, whereas the domestic courts had used amore “holistic” approach. Judge Keller notes that the Court is not a court of fourth instance and, thus,518 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsshould not conduct a new assessment of the facts. Moreover, the rigidity of the majority’s reasoning inclassifying the statements depending on whether they constitute hate speech or political speech may haveunforeseen implications in the future, especially when considering the increase in separatist movementsin several European countries.Lucie LaffontExtraordinary rendition and secret detentionExtraordinary rendition—secret detention—war on terror—black sites—torture—ill-treatment—effectiveinvestigation—art.3—unacknowledged and incommunicado detention—art.5—art.8—effective remedy—art.13 right to a fair trial—art.6(1)—art.2—death penalty—art.1 of Protocol No.6Detention without charge; Duty to undertake effective investigation; Inhuman or degrading treatmentor punishment; Right to effective remedy; Right to fair trial; Right to liberty and security; Romania;Suspects; Terrorists; Torture; United StatesAl Nashiri v Romania (Application No.33234/12)European Court of Human Rights (First Section): Judgment of 31 May 2018FactsThe applicant, Mr Abd Al Rahim Husseyn Muhammad Al Nashiri, a Saudi Arabian national of Yemenidescent is at present being detained by the US Central Intelligence Agency at the Guantánamo Bay NavalBase in Cuba for alleged terrorism offences. The applicant was initially captured in Dubai and was detainedby the CIA under the High-Value Detainee (HVD) Programme from November 2002 onwards for hisalleged role in the orchestration of the attacks on the US Navy ship USS Cole in Aden, Yemen, in 2000and on the French oil tanker MV Limburg in the Gulf of Aden in 2002. Mr Al Nashiri was transferred toseveral secret detention centres known as “black sites” in Thailand, Afghanistan and Poland before hisrendition to Romania in April 2004. According to a US Senate Committee Report published in 2014, theapplicant was transferred five times between June 2003 and September 2006, before being returned todetention in Guantánamo Bay. The applicant was detained at a CIA black site in Romania from April2004 to October/November 2005.While in CIA custody, the applicant alleges that he was routinely subjected to torture and ill-treatment,with interrogators employing a range of so-called “enhanced interrogation techniques”, including wallstanding, stress positions, waterboarding and cramped confinement standing in a box. The applicant furthertestified that he was hung upside down and forced to stand for extended periods of time, that he wasdeprived of clothes, forced to sleep on the floor, and had his diet manipulated. Following an attemptedhunger strike, the applicant was forced fed rectally by CIA staff. A psychological evaluation conductedby the US government revealed that Mr Al Nashiri was suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome.In 2011 United States Military Commission prosecutors brought capital charges against the applicantfor his alleged role in the attacks of 2000 and 2002, in respect of which he is currently awaiting trial. Aparliamentary inquiry in Romania on the questions of the existence of US secret detention sites and theparticipation of the authorities in the illegal transport of detainees was concluded in the negative in 2007.A criminal investigation based upon a complaint lodged before the Prosecutor General in 2012 remainsCase and Comment 519[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorspending. Bringing a case before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court), the applicant complainedthat the respondent government enabled his incommunicado detention, torture and ill-treatment at theblack site, along with the continued deprivation of contact with his family. Mr Al Nashiri also complainedthat in enabling his transport to other sites, the Romanian authorities exposed him to significant additionalrisks of an unfair trial, torture and the death penalty. Finally, the applicant complained that the authoritiesfailed to carry out an effective and thorough investigation. The complaints cover art.3, art.5, art.8, art.13,art.6(1) and art.2 of the Convention, and art.1 of Protocol No.6.Held(1) The respondent government’s objections that the issues complained of did not fall under thejurisdiction of Romania for the purposes of art.1 were dismissed (unanimous).Based upon an analysis of both the evidence presented in the relevant international inquiriesand its own previous case-law, the Court held that it was established beyond reasonabledoubt that the respondent government had hosted a CIA detention site, had cooperated inthe HVD programme, and were aware that the detainees were being exposed to serious risksto their Convention rights. The Court affirmed that these findings were sufficient to establishthe responsibility of a state and to fulfil the jurisdictional requirements of art.1.(2) The objections of the respondent government on the grounds of the non-exhaustion ofdomestic remedies and of non-compliance with temporal restrictions were also dismissed(unanimous).On the questions of the exhaustion of domestic remedies and compliance with the six-monthrule, the Court held that they should be joined to the merits on the basis that they overlappedwith the applicant’s claim under the procedural limb of art.3. These objections weresubsequently dismissed.(3) The applicant’s complaints under arts 23, 5, 6(1), 8 and 13 of the Convention, together withart.1 of Protocol No.6 were admissible (unanimous).(4) There had been a violation of art.3 on both procedural and substantive grounds (unanimous).The applicant complained under the procedural limb of art.3 that the Romanian authoritieshad failed to conduct a prompt and thorough investigation into the alleged ill-treatment atthe CIA detention site, resulting in a violation of the right to the truth. Citing its previouscase-law, the Court reaffirmed the duty arising from art.3 and art.1 to undertake prompt,thorough and effective investigations that are independent of the executive into ill-treatment,including the actions of foreign nationals performed with the state’s acquiescence. The Courtexamined the extent to which the parliamentary inquiry concluded in 2007 and the pendingcriminal investigation launched in 2012 were capable of fulfilling the investigativerequirements. It was held that in light of the limited scope of the inquiry which did not seekto ensure any accountability of the officials involved, the long delay in bringing a criminalinvestigation, and the failure to disclose information to the public, the respondent governmenthad failed to comply with the requirements under the procedural limb of art.3.On the question of a substantive violation of art.3, although the applicant was found not tohave been subjected to the most severe enhanced interrogation techniques while in detentionin Romania, the Court found that the “standard conditions of confinement” in accordancewith CIA guidelines including hooding, solitary confinement, the application of constantnoise and light, and shackling were routinely used as an integral part of the programme. TheCourt made reference to the force-feeding incident in May 2004, along with the constantfear and mental suffering resulting from the applicant’s previous experiences of torture,including waterboarding and prolonged close confinement. Consequently, it was held that520 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthe cumulative effects on the applicant, his physical and mental suffering amounted toinhuman treatment. The government’s role in facilitating the operation of the HVDprogramme on Romanian territory, and the public availability of information on the treatmentof terror suspects was deemed to evidence an “acquiescence and connivance” in theprogramme. The Court further emphasised that the respondent government’s awareness ofthe extraordinary rendition of the applicant, together with the real risk of further ill-treatment,enabled a breach of art.3 to be established.(5) There had been a violation of art.5 of the Convention (unanimous). The Court stated stronglythat the unacknowledged detention of an individual amounts to a “most grave violation” ofthe fundamental provisions under art.5. The Court held that the cooperation and logisticalassistance provided by the Romanian authorities secured the effective operation of the HVDprogramme outside the jurisdiction of the US courts. In light of the support provided, andthe respondent government’s knowledge of the activities and risks, the Court concluded thatthere had been a violation of art.5.(6) There had been a violation of art.8 of the Convention (unanimous).In relation to the art.8 claim on the basis of incommunicado detention and the deprivationof any contact with the applicant’s family, the Court emphasised that an essential purposeof art.8 is to protect individuals against arbitrary interference by public authorities. It wasfurther underlined that “private life” may include the moral and physical integrity of a person.In light of the respondent state’s responsibility under arts 3 and 5, the Court concluded thatan unjustified interference with the applicant’s art.8 right had similarly occurred in thecontext of his unlawful secret detention.(7) There had been a violation of art.13 of the Convention (unanimous).The Court found in favour of the applicant’s argument that his art.13 right to an effectiveremedy in conjunction with arts 3, 5, and 8 of the Convention had been breached. The Courtclarified that where an arguable claim of ill-treatment exists, the requirements under art.13go beyond those under arts 3 and 5 to conduct an effective investigation, requiringindependent and rigorous scrutiny of the claim. The Court referred to its findings on theapplicant’s arts 3, 5 and 8 complaints and held that the criminal investigation in Romaniadid not amount to an effective remedy for the purposes of art.13.(8) There had been a violation of art.6(1) of the Convention (unanimous).The Court recalled its previous case-law that a flagrant denial of justice for the purposes ofart.6 would occur where the breach of fair trial principles is “so fundamental as to amountto a nullification or destruction of the very essence of the right” and that the admission ofevidence obtained through torture would amount to such a breach. The Court found that thesame concerns expressed in the Al Nashiri v Poland case in respect of the military tribunalsthe applicant would be exposed to on transfer out of the territory applied, including thesufficiently high probability that evidence obtained through torture would be admitted.Accordingly, the Court held that Romania’s cooperation in the transfer of the applicant andthe foreseeability of a flagrant breach of fair trail rights amounted to a violation of art.6(1).(9) There had been a violation of arts 2 and 3 of the Convention taken together with art.1 ofProtocol No.6 (unanimous).The Court held that it was foreseeable that the applicant would be exposed to a substantialrisk of having the death penalty imposed on him if tried by a military commission after beingtransferred. The persistent nature of the risk was evidenced by the capital charges levelledagainst the applicant in 2011.Case and Comment 521[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors(10) The respondent state was obliged to pay the applicant €100,000 in respect of non-pecuniarydamages, in addition to any tax due, within a period of three months (unanimous).(11) The remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction was dismissed (unanimous).Cases consideredAksoy v Turkey (1997) 23 E.H.R.R. 553Al Nashiri v Poland (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 16Al-Saadoon v United Kingdom (2010) 51 E.H.R.R. 9Assanidze v Georgia (2004) 39 E.H.R.R. 32Assenov v Bulgaria (1999) 28 E.H.R.R. 652Chahal v United Kingdom (1997) 23 E.H.R.R. 413El-Masri v Macedonia (2013) 57 E.H.R.R. 25Husayn (Abu Zubaydah) v Poland (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 16Ilascu v Moldova (2005) 40 E.H.R.R. 46Imakayeva v Russia (2008) 47 E.H.R.R. 4Mocanu v Romania (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 19Nasr and Ghali v Italy (App. No. 44883/09), judgment of 23 February 2016Othman (Abu Qatada) v United Kingdom (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 1Selmouni v France (2000) 29 E.H.R.R. 403Soering v United Kingdom (1989) 11 E.H.R.R. 439CommentaryThe judgment of the Court in the present case represents a clear statement of the principles on the complicityof European states in the US “war on terror” policies introduced by the Bush administration in the wakeof the September 11 terror attacks. The accommodation of the CIA’s extraordinary rendition flights andthe hosting of secret “black site” detention centres on European soil has become the subject of internationalinquiries as well as a burgeoning body of jurisprudence before the European Court of Human Rights. Theroutine use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” upon suspects, the conditions under which they weretransported and detained, as well as their exposure to fair trial and death penalty risks have formed thebasis of a number of complaints. This judgment should therefore be viewed in the context of the Court’spreceding and concurrent decisions on extraordinary rendition and CIA detention, most notably those ofEl-Masri v Macedonia (2013), Al Nashiri v Poland (2014) and Abu Zubaydah v Lithuania (2018).The Court in this case was obliged to overcome the evidentiary challenges associated with the highlycovert nature of the CIA’s operations and the corresponding secrecy surrounding the bilateral arrangementswith the Romanian government. It did so by relying upon a range of international inquiries and expertfindings from the UN, the Council of Europe, the European Parliament, US policy documents, NGOreports, and media reports presenting evidence on the involvement of the Romanian authorities in CIAactivities, the conditions of detention, and the paths of the rendition flights.The Court’s unanimous decision finding violations of arts 3, 5, 8, 13, 6(1), (2), and art.1 of ProtocolNo.6 and awarding €100,000 in non-pecuniary damages closely followed the decision in Al Nashiri vPoland. The Court made many significant statements of principle, affirming for example the legitimatepublic interest in investigations and the democratic importance of freedom from arbitrary detention underart.5. Most significantly, however, the Court reaffirmed the non-derogable nature of the prohibition oftorture, even in the fight against terrorism and strongly condemned any Court that would permit theadmission of evidence obtained through torture. In the words of the Court, “[t]he trial process is thecornerstone of the rule of law. Torture evidence irreparably damages that process; it substitutes force for522 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthe rule of law and taints the reputation of any court that admits it”. This case, alongside those that havepreceded it, is likely to have significant ramifications both for the development of art.3 protections underthe Convention and, more broadly, for the future evolution of counter-terror policies in Europe.Alice VennConfiscation of land over unlawful site developmentConfiscation of land—site development—compensation—penalties—criminal proceedings—no punishmentwithout law—art.7—right to a fair trial—art.6—protection of property—art.1 of Protocol No.1—justsatisfaction—art.41Confiscation; Italy; National courts; No punishment without law; Protection of property; Right ofaccess to court; Unauthorised developmentGIEM Srl v Italy (Application Nos 1828/06, 34163/07 and 19029/11)European Court of Human Rights (Grand Chamber): Judgment of 28 June 2018FactsThe applicants in GIEM Srl v Italy are a group comprised of four companies, GIEM Srl, Hotel PromotionBureau Srl, RITA Sarda Srl and Falgest Srl, together with one individual, Mr F. Gironda, an Italian national.The cases concern the confiscation of land in the event of unlawful site development.The company GIEM Srl owned land in Bari situated in the coast at Punta Perotti, which was at the timeclassified as suitable for development. In May 1992, the Bari municipal council adopted a draft sitedevelopment agreement presented to an adjacent land owner, the company Sud Fondi, within which,according to GIEM Srl, its land was incorporated. In October 1992, the Bari municipal authority askedGIEM Srl if it would agree to a site development agreement, with GIEM Srl agreeing but receiving nosubsequent reply. In February 1995, Sud Fondi began construction on the site. In 17March 1997, followinga news article concerning the building works, the public prosecutor ordered a criminal investigation anda temporary measure restraining disposal of property in respect of all the buildings in question on thegrounds that Punta Perotti was a protected natural site and the construction was illegal. The Bari DistrictCourt acknowledged the illegality of the buildings in a judgment of 10 February 1999. While the Courtfound that no negligence or criminal intent could be imputed to the defendants because the local authorityhad issued the permits and because of lack of coordination between local and regional legislation, theCourt ordered the confiscation of all the developed land at Punta Perotti belonging to the applicant companywithout compensation. Following an appeal against the judgment from the public prosecutor calling forthe defendants to be convicted, the Bari Court of Appeal, in a judgment of 5 June 2000 overturned thedecision of the court below, acquitting the defendants and revoking the confiscationmeasure. In a judgmentof 29 January 2001, the Court of Cassation quashed the Court of Appeal’s decision without remitting it,acknowledged the material illegality of the site development plans and permission, acquitted the defendantand ordered the confiscation of all buildings on land. On 3 May 2001, G applied to the Court of Appealof Bari to return its land, but the Court upheld its claim. The Court of Cassation then quashed the Courtof Appeal decision in April 2009, remitting the case to the Bari District Court. In October 2012, the BariCase and Comment 523[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsmunicipal authority asked the Bari District Court to return the confiscated land, which the companyrecovered in December 2013.The company RITA Sarda Srl owned land it wished to develop and in March 1991 received approvalfrom the Sardinia Region to build a minimum of 150 metres from the sea, receiving subsequent approvalby the municipality of Golfo Aranci on 17 December 1991. On 22 June 1992, a regional law removed thepossibility of derogating from the prohibition of building a minimum of 2 kilometres from the sea fordwelling, a category extending to the hotel-type building the applicants wished to build. In October 1997,RITA Sarda Srl sold part of its land and 16 built units to Hotel Promotions Bureau Srl, thereby assigningconstruction rights. Suspected of a number of offences including unlawful site development, the publicprosecutor of Olbia opened a criminal investigation in respect of the legal representatives of the applicantcompanies, resulting in a court order restraining disposal of land and buildings. In March 2002, the landand buildings were returned to the rightful owners by the Sassari District Court. In March 2003, the OlbiaDistrict Court acquitted the defendants of all offences, with the exception of unlawful site developmentwhich was declared statute-barred, taking the view that the municipality of Golfo Aranci should not haveissued the building permits. The Court ordered the confiscation of the property, with the Court of Appealupholding the dismissal of the statute-barred offence and confirming the confiscation order. A furtherappeal by the defendants was made on points of law but dismissed by the Court of Cassation.The company Falgest Srl and Mr Gironda co-owned land at Testa di Cane and Fiumarella di Pellaro,with the land use plan providing for the possibility of building hotel-type buildings. A building permitwas issued by the municipality of Reggio di Calabria in September 1997. In 2002 the public prosecutoropened an investigation in respect ofMr Gironda and five others on suspicion of multiple offences includingunlawful site development, for which the Disctrict Court acquitted all defendants on of all charges exceptunlawful site development, which it declared statute-barred, thereby ordering the confiscation of the landand buildings. In April 2009, the Court of Appeal revoked the confiscation and returned it to the owners.The Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Court of Appeal without remitting it, finding that thecharge of unlawful site development was substantiated by the change in purpose of the constructions.The applicants complained before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that they had beendenied access to a court and therefore a violation of art.6(1), punishment without law and therefore aviolation of art.7, no effective remedy and therefore a violation of art.13, and on account of confiscatedproperty a violation of art1. Protocol No.1. Mr Gironda argued that his right to be presumed innocent hadbeen breached under art.6(2).Held(1) The Court decided to join the applications (unanimous).In view of similar events and legislative contexts giving rise to the applications, and in theinterest of the proper administration of justice, the Court declared that it was appropriate tojoin the applications.(2) The Court declared the applications admissible as to the complaints under art.6(1) and (2)and art.13 of the Convention, and art.1 of Protocol No.1 of the Convention (unanimous).(3) The Court declared, by a majority, the applications admissible to the complaint under art.7of the Convention.(4) There had been a violation of art.7 of the Convention in respect to all the applicant companies(15 votes to two).The Court found, having regard for the principle that a person cannot be punished for an actengaging the criminal liability of another, that the confiscationmeasures applied to individualsor legal entities not parties to the proceedings, in this case the applicant companies, areincompatible with art.7 of the Convention.524 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors(5) There had been no violation of art.7 in respect to Mr Gironda (10 votes to seven).(6) The Court found that the domestic court’s findings that all elements of unlawful sitedevelopment were met in the proceedings against him can be regarded, in substance, as adeclaration of liability meeting the requirement of art.7.(7) That there had been a violation of art.1 of Protocol No.1 to the convention in respect of allapplicants (unanimous).The Court found that the confiscation of the applicant’s land and buildings had constitutedan interference with their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their property as protected byart.1 of Protocol No.1. The Court noted that the automatic application of confiscation incases of unlawful site development as provided by Italian legislation does not provide forwhich instrument is most appropriate for specific circumstances and imbalanced applicationwith respect to the legitimate aim of the law and those affected. Therefore, the Court viewsthe confiscation as disproportionate in nature.(8) There was no need to decide whether there had been a violation of art.6 (1) of the Conventionin respect to the company GIEM Srl, or of art.13 in respect of the companies GIEM Srl andFalgest Srl (15 votes to two).While the Court found the complaints not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning ofart.35(3)(a), it took the view that it was not necessary to examine the complaints becausethey are covered by the complaints already examined under art.7 and art.1 of Protocol No.1.(9) There had been a violation of art.6 (2) of the Convention with respect to Mr Gironda (16votes to one).(10) The Court acknowledged that the applicant, Mr Gironda, was acquitted on appeal and theconfiscation measure revoked following recognition that the site-development plan wasfound compatible with relevant regulations. The Court found that the applicant’s presumptionof innocence was breached because the acquittal was quashed by the Court of Cassation,without being remitted, finding that the liability of the applicant has been proven and declaredguilty, in substance, notwithstanding that the prosecution of the offence was statute-barred.(11) The question of the application of art.41 is not ready for decision (unanimous).The Court decided to reserve the said question in whole; to invite the government and theapplicants to submit, within three months from the date of notification of the judgment, theirwritten observations on the matter and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreementthat they may reach; and to reserve the further procedure and delegates to the President ofthe Court the power to fix the same if need be.Cases consideredA.

(App. No.38602/02), judgment of 18 December 2012CommentaryGIEM Srl v Italy is a landmark decision of the Court, although the dissenting judges felt strongly aboutthe lack of clarity in terms of the interpretation of art.7. Given that at the heart of the case was the waythe Italian Constitutional Court interpreted the Convention, the separate opinions are also of great interestas they focused on the relationship between the Court and the domestic courts.In her concurring opinion, Judge Motoc clarified that she agreed with the majority, but for reasonsrelated to the coherence of the judicial dialogue between the Court and the Italian domestic courts. Thejudge emphasised the need to promote judicial dialogue between the Court and domestic courts particularlyin an evolving area of law. She discussed the challenges domestic courts face in aligning their jurisprudencewith the Court when the relevant international law keeps changing and commended the case for confirmingthe principles established in the Varvara v Italy case and for clarifying the less clear aspects of that case.In his lengthy opinion, Judge Pinto de Albuquerque also emphasised the importance of judicial dialogueand of the role of the Court “as the first interpreter” of the universality of human rights. His opinion wasa strong reminder for domestic courts that all the judgments of the Court have the same legal value andthat their binding nature and interpretative authority cannot depend on the formation by which they wererendered. In their partly dissenting, partly concurring opinion Judges Spano and Lemmens criticised themajority for missing an opportunity to correct their own case-law, for failing to engage with the Italiancourts and for trying to force upon the domestic authorities an interpretation of domestic law that ignoredits essential features. The judges agreed with the majority that the Italian legislation on the matter wasproblematic and therefore there had been a violation of art.1 of Protocol No.1. However, they concludedthat the Italian system of confiscation in the area of site development is not a “penalty” within the meaningof art.7 and therefore does not fall within the application of the provision. Judges Sajó, Karakaş, Pinto deAlbuquerque, Keller, Vehabović, Kūris and Grozev expressed a joint partly dissenting opinion in whichthey expressed concern about the way the Court applied its Varvara v Italy principles. The opinion focusedon the fact that the majority found no violation of art.7 in respect of Mr Gironda, while they concludedthat there had been a violation of art.6. In Varvara, just as in the present case, a confiscation was imposeddespite the fact that the criminal offence had been time-barred and there had been no verdict to establishhis criminal liability. The lack of a formal verdict led the Court to conclude at the time that the confiscationwas incompatible with art.7. In this case, however, the majority argued that a declaration of guilt wasenough to meet the art.7 conditions. It is for this reason that the dissenting judges criticised the majorityarguing that while the Court is not strictly speaking bound to follow its previous rulings, for the sake oflegal certainty and foreseeability, they should at least give the reasons why they departed from previouscase-law and explain whether this approach will form a new general rule or an exception to the Varvararuling.Anthony Morelli526 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsExpulsion of aliens on national security groundsExpulsion—aliens—lawful residence—national security—procedural guarantees—art.1 of Protocol No.7Expulsion; Foreign nationals; Macedonia; National security; Right to fair trialLjatifi v Macedonia (Application No.19017/16)European Court of Human Rights (First Section): Judgment of 17 May 2018FactsAged eight in 1999, the applicant Ms Ljatifi of Serbian nationality fled Kosovo with her family and settledin the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia where she has been living since. In 2005 she was grantedasylum and residency. The applicant and a Macedonian national entered into a common-law partnershipand they have three minor children who are all of Macedonian nationality. Until 3 February 2014 theapplicant’s residence permit was extended each year until the Ministry of Interior stopped her asylum dueto her posing a “risk to [national] security”. The applicant was legally represented at interview where sheconfirmed her family situation and intention to marry her partner. However, the threat she was consideredposing to national security was not discussed at this interview. The state’s decision required her to leavethe country “within twenty days of receipt of the final decision” and the applicant appealed the decisionas arbitrary. She argued that there was no evidence that her presence in the country posed a threat tonational security, nor was the applicant given the opportunity to address any evidence. On 3 July 2014,the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, upholding the Ministry’s decision as they hadobtained a classified written note from the Security and Counter IntelligenceAgency regarding the applicantrepresenting a threat to national security. There were no further details provided about this document andit ruled that lawful proceedings had been adhered to. The applicant’s lawyer appealed the decision beforethe Higher Administrative Court, echoing previous arguments made. In addition, it was expressed thatthe wording used by the Administrative Court suggested that there were existing documents which thedecision was based on, yet the applicant had been given no opportunity to comment on such evidence.On 6 October 2015, the applicant was served the decision that upheld theMinistry’s decision “on the basisof … classified information obtained from a relevant body [which] proves indisputably that her presence… represents a threat to [the state’s] security”. This classified information was later revealed to relate tothe applicant’s crimes of theft and concealment, as well as living in a common-law partnership in orderto obtain monetary allowance she was entitled to as a resident with granted asylum status.The applicant complained before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that there had beena violation of her right to a fair trial under art.6 because there had been no evidence that she representeda threat to national security; she had not been given any opportunity to have knowledge of or commenton the evidence; and the authorities had given no reason of their decision.Held(1) The Court declared the application to be admissible and decided to examine the applicant’scomplaint under art.1 of Protocol No.7 that protects an alien lawfully residing in the territoryof a state to be able to challenge their expulsion (unanimous).(2) There had been a violation of art.1 of Protocol No.7 (six votes to one).Case and Comment 527[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe Court found that the applicant was not offered the minimal procedural safeguardsguaranteed by the provision. The domestic courts also failed to provide a reason for theirdecision. The Court noted that the Ministry’s order for expulsion stated no more reason thanthe applicant being a risk to national security. Such a general statement with no details offactual evidence leading to this decision do not sufficiently deliver administrative andprocedural justice to the applicant.(3) The Court decided not to examine the complaint under art.13 as the applicant accused theadministrative courts of not providing effective review of her case (unanimous).(4) The respondent government is to pay the applicant €2,400 in respect of non-pecuniarydamage as well as €1,600 in respect of costs and expenses within three months of the finaljudgment (unanimous).Cases consideredBelchev v Bulgaria (App. No.39270/98), judgment of 8 April 2004Bolat v Russia (2008) 46 E.H.R.R. 18CG v Bulgaria (2008) 47 E.H.R.R. 51Société Plon v France (App. No.58148/00), judgment of 18 August 2004Hajnal v Serbia (App. No.36937/06), judgment of 19 June 2012Kaya v Romania (App. No.33970/05), (2010) 50 E.H.R.R. 14Lupsa v Romania (App. No.10337/04), judgment of 8 June 2006Nolan v Russia (2011) 53 E.H.R.R. 29Radomilja v Croatia (App. No.37685/10), judgment of 20 March 2018Regner v Czech Republic (2018) 66 E.H.R.R. 9Söderman v Sweden (App. No.5786/08), judgment 12 November 2013Vučković v Serbia (2014) 59 E.H.R.R. 19CommentaryThis is an interesting case in that the Court “being the master of the characterisation to be given in law tothe facts of the case” decided that the applicant’s complaint should be examined under art.1 of ProtocolNo.7 instead of art.6 as requested by the applicant. Given that art.1 of Protocol No.7 has not been used asmuch as art.6, it is important to see the clear and straightforward interpretation of the provision and itsapplication to the facts, especially at a time the rights of asylum seekers are being constantly challenged.The two opinions by Judge Eicke and Sicilianos, although adopting different approaches, also shed lighton the interpretation of the provision and the Court’s previous case-law.Judge Eicke focused on a technical point arguing that there should be a distinction between the actionsof the competent authorities that constitute an actual and a would-be violation. He referred to the Court’sprevious case-law on expulsion and emphasised the fact that Ms Ljatifi’s case does not demonstrate adirect violation of art.1 of Protocol No.7, but rather the potential for a violation to occur. Judge Eickeargued that in previous decisions where a violation was found, the Court had to deal with the forcefulremoval of applicants from the territory of a country or the prevention of re-entering a country where theapplicants had previously lawfully resided. In contrast, Ms Ljatifi was not removed from the country butwas served with a decision ending her right to asylum in Macedonia and that she “should voluntarilyleave” on national security grounds. Furthermore, she was given permission to re-enter the country “onemonth after the expiry of the time-limit for returning”. As a result, Judge Eicke argued that there was nodefinitive departure of the applicant and she was granted re-entry to remain with her family despite national528 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorssecurity concerns. This should lead to the conclusion that there “would have been a violation … if theapplicant had been expelled on the basis of the decision of 3 February 2014”.On the other hand, the concurring opinion of Judge Sicilianos placed significant emphasis on thepreventative character of the procedural guarantees of art.1 of Protocol No.7. The effectiveness of thearticle rests on the ability to exercise the principle before an expulsion of an alien occurs in order to ensureaccessible and foreseeable legal grounds and to allow the individual concerned to submit reasons againsttheir expulsion and have their case reviewed. To wait until the expulsion has occurred renders the rightas inefficient. The judge compared Ljatifi’s circumstances to the recent case of Regner v Czech Republic,in which a Czech national was found to have no right of reviewing documents containing classifiedinformation when he was dismissed from the Ministry of Defence for representing a threat to nationalsecurity. The judge highlighted the difference between the two cases in which a national was dismissedand an alien faced expulsion and argued that while access to classified intelligence is not a right in itself,an alien should have the right to challenge and defend their case.Kaj HadadPolice entrapment and undercover workVictim of police entrapment—police undercover work—police collaborators—witness—right to a fairtrial—art.6Bribery; Entrapment; Georgia; Police powers and duties; Right to examine witnesses; Right to fairtrialTchokhonelidze v Georgia (Application No.31536/07)European Court of Human Rights (Fifth Section): Judgment of 28 June 2018FactsThe applicant was a Georgian national who was deputy to the Governor of theMarneuli Region responsiblefor managing state-owned land and developing infrastructure. The applicant was assigned to examine anapplication for a permit to build a petrol station which was made by an individual, Ms K. The officialreports show that the applicant asked Ms K for a bribe of US$30,000, of which US$20,000 would go tothe Governor, and the remaining US$10,000 would be split between the applicant and representatives ofother agencies involved. Ms K supposedly reported this to the Department of Constitution Security of theMinistry of Internal Affairs (the “DCS”), which then opened a criminal investigation into the applicant.The DCS set up Ms K to pay the applicant a US$10,000 down payment, and when the payment wasmade, the DCS entered the room and arrested the applicant. He was charged with the crime of requestinga large bribe. At trial, the applicant did not contest the evidence that he took the money but claimed thathe had been entrapped by the DCS. He claimed he had not asked for themoney as a bribe but as an advancepayment to a construction company to expedite the construction of the petrol station. Ms K gave evidence,conflicting with the official report, saying that this was the case, but that she was not sure if the applicanthad intended to keep the money and suspected that he might. She was then herself charged with givingconflicting witness statements.Case and Comment 529[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsMs K was established in court to have been an undercover agent for the DCS prior to the first meetingwith the applicant, seeking to expose criminal activity by the Governor. It also appeared that Ms N, whothe land had been purchased from (with the sale expedited by the applicant), was also in collaborationwith the DCS. The applicant tried to summon Ms N as a witness to support his claim of entrapment, buther whereabouts was unknown, so the court ruled that it was objectively impossible to summon her as awitness.The trial court found the applicant guilty, stating that the available evidence did not support his claimthat the money was taken as an advance payment for construction. They did not address the argument thatthe applicant had been entrapped by Ms K on behalf of the DCS. The applicant appealed upon this point,seeking again to call Ms N as a witness. Despite some evidence of her whereabouts coming to light, shedid not appear before the appellate court, submitting a written statement stating that she could not do sodue to her family situation. The appellate court upheld the conviction, reiterating the lack of support forthe argument that the money was an advance payment, and again neglecting to examine the claim forentrapment. Further appeal to the Supreme Court by the applicant was rejected, but the applicant wasgranted a presidential pardon after serving two of his seven years sentence. The applicant complainedbefore the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that his conviction had been unfair because ithad been based on evidence obtained through police entrapment (art.6(1)) and also that his right to obtainattendance and examination of witnesses had been violated because the courts failed to question the secondundercover officer.Held(1) The Court declared the complaints under art.6(1) right to fair hearing and art.6(3)(d) rightto examine witnesses admissible (unanimous).(2) The Court held that there had been a violation of art.6(1) right to fair hearing (unanimous).The Court accepted that it should use the facts as found by the domestic courts, thereforeworked from the basis that the applicant did ask for the money as a bribe from Ms K. Thepoint left unexamined therefore was whether the applicant was the victim of an entrapmentby the police, and the question of an art.6(1) violation turned on whether the domestic courtsfailed to address it. The Court noted that its jurisprudence had previously held that entrapmentis not justifiable in the public interest, whereas undercover police work is justifiable as longas there are sufficient safeguards in place.The Court’s test to distinguish between entrapment and undercover police work consists ofexamining the substance first, and then if there is insufficient information available toconclude whether there were sufficient procedural safeguards to prevent entrapment fromhappening. The Court felt unable to conclude whether the DCS had confined itself to“investigating criminal activity in an essentially passive manner”. It felt the investigationwas tainted by the fact that Ms K was not an ordinary private citizen, as it was on recordthat she had been a frequent collaborator with the DCS; on the other hand, they also notedthat the applicant was the one who proposed the financial pay-off, whether they acceptedor not that it was for his personal benefit. It was therefore unclear whether Ms K had takenan active and decisive role in the commission of the offence.On the procedural point, the Court looked for evidence of authorisation or supervision,ideally by a judge, of the DCS’s operation which could ensure it was justified andaccountable. They found no such supervision and felt that this was made more serious bythe failure of any judicial review when the issue of entrapment was raised by the applicantin his trial. The Court held that the inadequate framework for supervising and reviewing the530 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsuse of an undercover agent, particularly following the applicant raising the well-substantiatedallegations of entrapment at trial, violated his art.6(1) right to fair trial.(3) The Court held that there was no need to examine the complaint under art.6(3)(d)(unanimous).The Court acknowledged the applicant’s submission that his art.6(3)(d) right to examinewitnesses against him was also implicated by not having opportunity to examine Ms N inthis case. They felt that this was amply covered by the finding of violation of art.6(1),however, and did not consider it necessary to consider this separately.(4) The Court held that the respondent state is to pay the applicant €2,500 in respect ofnon-pecuniary damage (unanimous).(5) The Court dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction (unanimous).Cases consideredBannikova v Russia (App. No.18757/06), judgment of 4 November 2010Eurofinacom v France (App. No.58753/00), judgment of 17 September 2004Furcht v Germany (2015) 61 E.H.R.R. 25Ildani v Georgia (App. No.65391/09), judgment of 23 April 2013Khudobin v Russia (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 22Lüdi v Switzerland (1993) 15 E.H.R.R. 173Matanović v Croatia (App. No.2742/12), judgment of 4 April 2017Milinienė v Lithuania (App. No.74355/01), judgment of 24 June 2008Nosko and Nefedov v Russia (App. Nos 5753/09 and 11789/10), judgment of 30 October 2014Ramanauskas v Lithuania (App. No.74420/01), (2010) 51 E.H.R.R. 11Sandu v Republic of Moldova (App. No.16463/08), judgment of 11 February 2014Sepil v Turkey (App. No.17711/07), judgment of 12 November 2013Shannon v United Kingdom (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 660Teixeira de Castro v Portugal (1998) 28 E.H.R.R. 101Veselov v Russia (App. Nos 23200/10, 24009/07 and 556/10), judgment of 2 October 2012CommentaryWhile relatively uncontroversial, this case does represent some development of the Court’s jurisprudenceon the human rights implications of entrapment. It is significant in that it aims to analyse the factualsituation which constitutes entrapment, while maintaining the principle of subsidiarity, and not acting asa “court of fourth instance”. In this sense, the Court analysed the police procedure, and safeguards takenin conducting an undercover operation, to find a violation of the applicant’s art.6(1) right to fair trial. TheCourt was careful to note its position as a supervisory body and stated that it would not re-evaluate thedomestic courts’ finding of fact in this case.In dealing with the substantive aspect of the test for entrapment, the judgment opted not to draw aconclusion on whether the applicant was, in fact, a victim of entrapment, but it is noteworthy that theCourt’s treatment of the facts does appear to show some sympathy to the applicant’s claim that the factualfindings of the domestic courts were inaccurate. They refer to the domestic courts’ finding frequently asthe “official version of events” and compare this in their analysis of the substance of the investigationwith the applicant’s version. This could be interpreted as some evaluation of the facts, contrary to thestatement made in the judgment.The Court opted to make its finding based instead on the procedural aspect of the test for entrapment,analysing legislative safeguards and judicial supervision of the police investigation, and relying on thisCase and Comment 531[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsas the reasoning for its finding of a violation. This is another incident in the Court’s case-law (similar tosome art.2 cases) where it opts to use analysis of procedural safeguards to create a quasi-presumption infavour of the claimant, to overcome an inability to draw safe conclusions based on the substance of theallegation.Christopher GrayFreedom of expression in the political spherePolitical opinion—defamation—insult via the press—interference by a public authority—necessary in ademocratic society—“chilling effect”—criminal sanctions—freedom of expression—art.10Convictions; Defamation; Freedom of expression; Greece; Interference; Necessary in democraticsociety; ProportionalityParaskevopoulos v Greece (Application No.64184/11)European Court of Human Rights (First Section): Judgment of 28 June 2018FactsIn December 2007, the applicant, Mr Panagiotis Paraskevopoulos, published an article in a local newspaper(Chortiatis 570) titled “The ludicrousness of power”. In the article, he made a series of statements thatalthough did not mention any people directly, contained sufficient information from which to deduce thatthe person the article was written about was the head of the local council, EP.EP filed a criminal complaint against the applicant alleging that the applicant had committed slanderousdefamation via the press. In response, the applicant argued that what he had written was correct andtherefore not unlawful. He further argued that he had written his article with a legitimate interest in thecase given his position as a constituent of EP. The case was heard in the Court of First Instance ofThessaloniki on 24 September 2008 at which time the applicant was found guilty and sentenced to asix-month suspended sentence.The applicant appealed the decision and on 28 May 2009 the Court of Appeal altered the charges fromslanderous defamation to insult via the press and accordingly found the applicant guilty and sentencedhim to a four-month suspended sentence.The applicant appealed this decision to the Court of Cassation arguing that the Court of Appeal providedinsufficient reasoning for rejecting the arguments he had advanced. On 5May 2010 the Court of Cassationquashed the sentence against which the applicant had appealed and returned the case to the Court of Appealin order to be retried.On 13 July 2010 the Court of Appeal reheard the case and again rejected the applicant’s argument thathe had not committed a crime under art.367 of the Greek Criminal Code and sentenced him to a two-monthsuspended sentence for insult via the press.The applicant once more appealed to the Court of Cassation which, on 23 February 2011, dismissedhis appeal finding that this time the Court of Appeal had provided sufficient reasoning and that the Courtof Appeal had acted correctly in dismissing the applicant’s arguments as he had “intended to insult EP”and had used expressions which were not necessary for defending a legitimate interest.532 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe applicant subsequently lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights (the Court)on 23 September 2011 alleging his art.10 right had been violated.Held(1) There had been a violation of art.10 (unanimous).The Court found that the actions by the Government amounted to an “interference by apublic authority” and were therefore a prima facie breach of art.10. As such, it was requiredto examine whether the arguments advanced by the Government fell within the exceptionsfound in art.10(2). The cumulative test for whether the exceptions have been satisfied is asfollows: the infringement must be prescribed by law, pursue one or more of the legitimateaims set out in para.2 and it must be necessary, in a democratic society, to infringe theapplicant’s rights in the way that they were infringed in order to achieve those aims.The Court found that the infringement was prescribed by provisions of the Greek CriminalCode and that it pursued the legitimate aim of “protecting the reputation or rights of others”as set out in para.2.The primary point of discussion was whether the infringement was necessary in a democraticsociety. The Court began by reaffirming its assertion that art.10 protects not only informationand ideas that are received favourably but also information and ideas which shock, offendor disturb, as such a level of pluralism is necessary for a democratic society to function.In order to determine whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society theCourt was required to ascertain whether it was in response to a “pressing social need”, amatter in which, it was opined, states are afforded a certain margin of appreciation. TheCourt was careful to point out that its function was not to assume the position of the domesticcourts but rather to exercise a supervisory function and ascertain whether the interferencewas relevant, sufficient and proportionate to the aims pursued. In doing so, the Court foundit important to differentiate between “statements of facts” and value judgments as theexistence of the former is demonstrable whilst determining the truth of the latter is impossible.Also, the Court held that even though the protection afforded to value judgments underart.10 is wide, the judgment must be based upon a sufficient factual basis. The Court furtherreasoned that when exercising its supervisory function, the statements in question must beviewed in their full context as opposed to an abstract manner.Finally, the Court reasoned that in deciding whether an interference is necessary in ademocratic society in order to protect the reputation or rights of others, it was required todetermine whether the domestic authorities had struck a fair balance between two competingrights both guaranteed by the Convention. In the present case, these were deemed to beart.10 (right to freedom of expression) and art.8 (right to private life). The Court held thatin order for art.8 to be triggered, the attack on a person’s reputation must attain a certainlevel of seriousness and be carried out in way which prejudices the personal enjoyment oftheir art.8 right. In deciding whether these two competing rights have been balanced correctly,the Court stated that the following criteria ought to be considered: (a) whether the remarkswere a contribution to a debate of general interest; (b) howwell known the person concernedis and what the subject of the publication was; (c) prior conduct of the person concerned;(d) method of obtaining the information and its veracity; (e) content, form and consequencesof the publication; and (f) severity of the sanction imposed.In applying these principles to the present case and given that the accusation made by theapplicant concerned the public activities of EP, the Court found that they were clearly amatter of legitimate concern about which the applicant was entitled to hold a view. InCase and Comment 533[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsdetermining this fact, the Court placed a measure of importance on the position EP held asan elected official opining that she is therefore expected to display a greater level of tolerancegiven the scrutiny which her role entails. The Court also took issue with the way in whichthe domestic courts did not view the statements in question in their full context but ratherthey were detached from their context and meaning. In this regard, the Court conceded thatthe applicants remarks could have been seen as provocative, but it found no evidence tosuggest that they were insulting and in doing so, opined that writers are entitled to a degreeof sarcasm and exaggeration which need not be subject to proof.Finally, the Court found that, although the use of criminal sanctions in defamation cases isnot automatically disproportionate, they are only considered proportionate in exceptionalcircumstances, such as hate speech or incitement to violence. In the present case, it foundthat, given this was a debate of public interest, criminal sanctions were not justified and that,although the sentence was suspended this was not sufficient to negate the disproportionatenature of the sanctions given the “chilling” effect imposing criminal sanctions could haveon public discussion.(2) The respondent state is to pay the applicant €7,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and€5,655 in respect of costs and expenses (unanimous).(3) The remainder of the application for just satisfaction was dismissed (unanimous).Cases consideredA v Norway (App. No.28070/06), judgment of 9 April 2009Axel Springer AG v Germany (2012) 55 E.H.H.R. 6Bédat v Switzerland (App. No.56925/08), (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 15Falzon v Malta (App. No.45791/13), judgment of 20 March 2018Instytut Ekonomichnykh Reform, TOV v Ukraine (App. No.61561/08), judgment of 2 June 2018Lindon v France (2007) 46 E.H.H.R. 35Marchenko v Ukraine (App. No.4063/04), (2010) 51 E.H.R.R. 36Mengi v Turkey (2016) 63 E.H.H.R. 5MGN Ltd v United Kingdom (2011) 53 E.H.H.R. 5Pedersen and Baadsgaard v Denmark (App. No.49017/99), judgment of 19 June 2003Perna v Italy 6 May 2003 (App. No.48898/99), (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 24Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy and Satamedia Oy v Finland (2017) 66 E.H.H.R. 8Sokołowski v Poland (App. No.75955/01), judgment of 29 March 2005Tuşalp v Turkey (App. No.32131/08), judgment of 21 February 2012CommentaryThe present decision is undoubtedly a welcome one owing to the way in which the Court explained, ingreat detail, the way in which art.10 ought to be considered and approached by domestic courts. In particular,the observation that writers and journalists are able to use a certain degree of sarcasm or exaggeration intheir work is welcome given the current political climate in which journalists, and their work, are underincreasing scrutiny. In the same vein, the way in which the Court explained that, owing to the electedposition of EP she should expect a greater degree of criticism, especially of her official functions, iswell-timed given the accusations of “fake news” which appear to regularly permeate political discourse.Finally, the affirmation by the Court that criminal sanctions are a disproportionate way in which to pursue534 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsa legitimate aim, owing to the chilling effect they may have, is welcome as will surely contribute tofacilitating political discourse between constituents and their elected representatives.Jordan OwenInvestigative journalism and classified documentsInvestigative journalism—armed forces—reception of classified information—information in the publicdomain—public interest—criminal sanctions—“chilling effect”—freedom of the press—freedom ofexpression—art.10Armed forces; Classified information; Freedom of expression; Interference; Journalists; Necessary indemocratic society; Publication; RomaniaGîrleanu v Romania (Application No.50376/09)European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section): Judgment of 26 June 2018FactsThe case concerned a Romanian investigative journalist working for the national daily newspaper Românialiberă and the leaking of secret military information from 2003 and 2004. These leaks and their sourcewere discussed in articles within the national daily newspapers, România liberă and Ziua. Following thepublication of these articles, the prosecutor’s office attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justiceopened an investigation based on the articles. As a result, the prosecutor decided to initiate criminalproceedings against the applicant and four others (PI—a former member of the armed forces, OS—ajournalist, EG and IM) for disclosing classified information on national security. During the course oftheir investigations, phone calls involving the applicant were intercepted, his house was searched, hiscomputer hard-drive was taken, and the applicant was taken into police custody. The result was theprosecutor discerning that the applicant had received a CD with the leaked military documents from OSon 2 July 2005, that the two had discussed the documents with other journalists and employees of theRomanian Armed Forced and Intelligence Service and that the applicant had subsequently provided copiesof the CD to EG and IM. On 15 August 2007, the prosecutor decided that the applicant, as a result of theabove conduct, had committed the crime of gathering and sharing secret or confidential information andhad acted with the intent to disclose classified information outside the associated legal framework. Theprosecutor did, however, decide not to indict the applicant and instead issued a fine and ordered theapplicant to pay part of the judicial costs. In doing so, the prosecutor noted the information was not likelyto endanger national security and was not likely to endanger military personnel as it had been originallycompromised in the summer of 2004. On 6 November 2007, the applicant complained against that decisionto the superior prosecutor, who rejected the complaint as ill-founded. Subsequently, on 3 December 2007,the applicant complained against the prosecutors’ decisions before the Bucharest Court of Appeal. Withthe applicant arguing that the laws in question only imposed obligations on those who work with secretinformation and that, in line with art.10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, it was difficult tojustify the imposition of sanctions for the publication of such material after they had entered the publicdomain. On 5 February 2008, the Bucharest Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s complaint asill-founded. The applicant appealed the decision before the High Court of Cassation and Justice, alsoCase and Comment 535[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorssubmitting that that the prosecutor’s decision had breached his freedom of expression in an attempt tocover up an embarrassing situation for the authorities. The Court rejected the applicant’s complaint withfinal effect on 23 March 2009, with the Court noting that the law applied to anyone who shared secretinformation outside the legal framework and that the applicant had done so with direct intent. The Courtagreed that the crime had not required criminal sanctions and ordered the applicant to pay court fees.The applicant subsequently complained before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) citingan infringement of his right to freedom of expression under art.10 of the Convention.Held(1) The application was considered admissible (unanimous).Considering the admissibility of the case, the Court joined the issue of admissibility to themerits as the state’s objection was “closely linked to the merits of the application”. In doingso, the Court confirmed that the application was not manifestly ill-founded under art.35.The Court noted that art.10 has established the importance of gathering information forjournalism and has highlighted instances in which journalists have conducted preparatoryresearch and disclosed confidential information or information concerning national security.(2) There had been a violation of art.10 (unanimous).The Court subsequently determined that art.10 was applicable in the case and the actions ofthe state had constituted an interference with the applicant’s right to freedom of expression.As a result, the Court noted that in order to justify such an interference it must be shownthat the interference was “prescribed by law”, pursued one or more of the legitimate aimsmentioned art.10(2) and was “necessary in a democratic society”. The Court noted that thedomestic legal framework had provided that “no one has the right to make public secretactivities regarding national security” and that the domestic courts had decided this appliedto everyone. As a result, the Court accepted that the interference was “prescribed by law”within the meaning of art.10(2). The Court also accepted the state’s position that theinterference pursued the legitimate aim of protecting national security; consequently theCourt’s analysis focused on whether the interference was “necessary in a democratic society”.The Court noted that the question of whether an interference with the freedom of expressionis “necessary in a democratic society” is well-established in the Court’s case-law. It acceptedthat there is little scope under the Convention to restrict freedom of expression in two areas,namely political speech and matters of public interest. However, protection afforded tojournalists under art.10 is dependent on them acting in good faith to provide accurate andreliable information “in accordance with the tenets of responsible journalism”. Whether ajournalist’s conduct was lawful is also considered a relevant, but not decisive, considerationfor deciding whether the journalist had acted responsibly. In order to examine whether thestate’s conduct was “necessary in a democratic society”, the Court would examine thefollowing aspects: the interests at stake, the conduct of the applicant, the review of themeasure by the domestic courts and whether the penalty imposed was proportionate. Inexamining the interests at stake, the Court noted that the documents the applicant had obtainedand the fact they had been leaked by the military were likely to “raise questions of publicinterest”. From the state’s perspective, the Court was concerned with whether the actionsof the applicant were capable of causing “considerable damage” to national security. Havingregard for the facts of the case, the Court noted that the information in question was acceptedby the domestic courts as outdated, not likely to endanger national security and had beende-classified after the investigation began. Thus, the state had been unable to show that the536 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsapplicant disclosing the information to EG and IM was liable to cause considerable damageto national security.In analysing the applicant’s conduct, the Court noted that in comparison to other cases theapplicant was not a member of the armed forces with incumbent duties and responsibilities.It was noted that the applicant did not obtain the information illegally and that his first courseof action was to discuss the leak with the concerned armed forces, equally the result of theapplicant’s investigation was the discussion of the subject within the media, RomanianSenate and an internal inquiry within theMinistry of Defence. Regarding the measures takenby the domestic courts, the Court recognised that “the fairness of proceedings may need tobe taken into account” when examining cases concerning an interference with the exerciseof art.10. The Court’s assessment of the state’s actions noted that they failed to take intoaccount the above-mentioned conduct of the applicant in dealing with the information, thatthe information in question was not likely to endanger national security and had failed toconsider the public interest in being informed of the information leak. Although recognisingthat the fines imposed by the state were relatively low, the Court noted that the purpose ofthe sanctions was to prevent the applicant publishing and sharing the documents and thatthey should have “more thoroughly weighed” the decision to impose sanctions after thede-classification of the documents. As a result of this analysis, the Court found that themeasures taken against the applicant were not reasonably proportionate to the legitimateaim pursued.Cases consideredBédat v Switzerland [GC] (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 15Bucur and Toma v Romania (App. No.40238/02), judgment of 8 January 2013Cobzaru v Romania (App. No.48254/99), (2008) 47 E.H.R.R. 10Dammann v Switzerland (App. No.77551/01), judgment of 25 April 2006Fressoz and Roire v France (App. No.29183/95), (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 2Hadjianastassiou v Greece (App. No.12945/87), judgment of 16 December 1992Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v Hungary (App. No.18030/11), judgment of 8 November 2016Nilsen v Norway [GC] (2000) 30 E.H.R.R. 878Pasko v Russia (App. No.69519/01), judgment of 22 October 2009Pentikäinen v Finland [GC] (2017) 65 E.H.R.R. 21Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy v Finland [GC] (2018) 66 E.H.R.R. 8 (extracts)Schweizerische Radio- und Fernsehgesellschaft SRG v Switzerland (App. No.34124/06), judgmentof 21 June 2012Shapovalov v Ukraine (App. No.45835/05), judgment of 31 July 2012Stoll v Switzerland (App. No.69698/01), (2008) 47 E.H.R.R. 59CommentaryThe case confirmed the importance of the freedom of the press under art.10 when dealing with the leakingof secret, classified or confidential information which is likely to raise questions of public interest. Indoing so, the Court also confirmed that journalists and the media do themselves have duties andresponsibilities in handling and disseminating such information, with the need to act “in accordance withthe tenets of responsible journalism”. Within the facts of the case an important consideration was theimpact of the applicant receiving and sharing the documents on debate concerning the leak in the mediaas well as the armed forces and Romanian Senate, with this exemplifying the importance placed on theCase and Comment 537[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsfreedom enshrined in art.10. The Court’s analysis also stressed that, although the media may have certainduties and responsibilities, it is for the state to ensure that no confidential material is disclosed and to takeappropriate action once a leak is discovered.The importance of the judgment is equally seen in affirming the principles protected by art.10. Duringthe case, there were prominent third-party submissions and comments concerning the case and art.10,with these concerning the importance of ensuring the activities of investigative journalists. By confirmingthat the responsibilities and duties of journalists dealing with such information is distinct from theresponsibilities of those working for the state or armed forces, the Court has prevented a feared “chillingeffect” of imposing similarly strict obligations on journalists who receive or investigate such sensitiveinformation. Considering the Court had recognised that the sanctions imposed on the applicant werethemselves “low”, the finding that they were still disproportionate would seem to further preclude anyattempt by states to impose sanctions on journalists with the aim of preventing the publishing and sharingof confidential or classified documents whose publication are in the public interest. In this sense, the casecan be seen as an important affirmation of the importance of investigative journalism for the preservationof “democratic society”.Richard CostidellConfidentiality of exchanges between a lawyer and their clientsProtected correspondence—interception of a folded piece of paper—clients under police escort—right torespect for private life—art.8Confidentiality; France; Interception of communications; Legal professional privilege; Police powersand duties; Right to respect for private and family lifeLaurent v France (Application No.28798/13)European Court of Human Rights (Fifth Section): Judgment of 24 May 2018FactsThe applicant, M. Cyril Laurent, is a French national residing in Brest (France).On 1 April 2008, M. Laurent, who is a lawyer, conducted the defence of HB and BD who had bothbeen formally charged and placed at that time under police escort. While waiting in the court’s lobbyunder police escort, HB and BD sat around a table with M. Laurent, still wearing his lawyer’s robes.During the conversation, HB and BD asked the applicant for his business card. M. Laurent, who did nothave any with him, wrote his contact details for each of them on two separate pieces of paper which hethen folded and gave to his clients. The deputy police sergeant in charge of the escort requested first thatHB, and then BD, showed himwhat had been written on the papers. The applicant, M. Laurent, reproachedthe police sergeant for not respecting the confidentiality of the exchange with his clients.On 8 April 2008, the applicant lodged a complaint with the Brest public prosecutor, alleging that thesecrecy of correspondence had been breached by a person exercising public authority. The prosecutordecided to take no action on the matter but asked nonetheless that a recall of the relevant legal provisionsbe made to the deputy police sergeant as well as to all police officers in charge of escort.538 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsM. Laurent decided to file a criminal complaint with the investigating judge of the Brest Tribunal deGrande Instance (TGI). He claimed that the correspondence between a lawyer and their clients wasprotected by the Penal Code. The investigating judge issued a discontinuance order. On 28 October 2011,this decision was upheld by the Rennes Court of Appeal. M. Laurent lodged an appeal on points of lawwhich was dismissed by the Cassation Court.The applicant complained before the European Court of Human Rights that art.8 (right to respect forprivate life) of the Convention had been breached by France.Held(1) There had been a violation of art.8 (unanimous).Concerning the existence of an interference, the Court reiterated that art.8 protects theconfidentiality of communications, whatever the content or the form of these communications.This protection includes the correspondence of prisoners, be they the senders or recipients.A folded piece of paper on which a lawyer has written a message to his client shall beconsidered as a correspondence protected by art.8. The interception of this correspondenceby a police officer then amounts to an interference with this right. However, this interferencedoes not breach art.8 if it is provided for by the law, with a legitimate aim, and is necessaryin a democratic society.First, the Court noted that neither the TGI or the Cassation Court considered that the scrutinyof the exchanges between a lawyer and his clients were regulated by any of the specific legalprovisions which had been invoked before them. The Court could thus have raised thequestion of whether or not the interference was provided for by law. However, in the presentcase, the Court did not consider that it was necessary since the breach concerned anotherground.Concerning the legitimate aim of the interference, the Court considered that the policeofficer’s interception had the legitimate objective of preventing criminal offences anddefending public order.Finally, the Court analysed whether the interference was necessary in a democratic society.While the Court recognised that a certain control of the prisoners’ correspondence was notcontrary to the Convention, the exchanges between a lawyer and his detained client enjoya privileged status under art.8. Accordingly, prison authorities can only open a letter froma lawyer to a prisoner if they have reasons to believe that it contains something illicit whichcould not be detected through the normal means of detection. The term “necessary”, withinthe meaning of art.8, requires the existence of a pressing social need, and especially theproportionality between the interference and the legitimate aim pursued. In the present case,there was no reason to justify the interception of the pieces of paper and the police officerdid not claim that they raised any particular suspicions. Moreover, the applicant, M. Laurent,did not hide his action from the police escort. The interception was thus not justified. TheCourt also added that the content of the intercepted paper was not relevant since, whatevertheir purpose, the correspondence between a lawyer and his client concern private andconfidential matters.In view of the above, the Court concluded that the interception and opening of thecorrespondence were not necessary in a democratic society and that art.8 had been breached.(2) The Court held that the finding of a violation provided in itself sufficient just satisfactionfor the nonpecuniary damage sustained by M. Laurent (unanimous).Case and Comment 539[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCases consideredCampbell v United Kingdom (1992) 15 E.H.R.R. 137Frérot v France (App. No.70204/01), judgment of 12 June 2007Michaud v France (App. No. 12323/11), (2014) 59 E.H.R.R. 9Özen v Turkey (2014) 58 E.H.R.R. 27Silver v United Kingdom (1983) 5 E.H.R.R. 347Yefimenko v Russia (App. No. 152/04), judgment of 12 February 2013CommentaryIn the present case, the Court reiterated the principle of Michaud v France confirming that art.8 of theConvention protects the confidentiality of communications whatever their content or form. A folded pieceof paper on which a lawyer has written a message to his client is therefore protected correspondence withinthe meaning of art.8. As a result, the interception by a police officer of such correspondence shall constitutean interference. The Court also recalled that the exchanges between a lawyer and their clients enjoyed aprivileged status which means that, unless the prison authorities have reasonable cause to believe theycontain illicit element that the classic means of detection could not reveal, they shall not be opened. Inthis respect, the content of the intercepted paper in the present case does not matter since the objective isthat the correspondence between a lawyer and is client remain confidential and private. Article 8 is thusan essential tool to safeguard the professional secrecy, in particular between a lawyer and a detained client.Jennyfer Vervisch540 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsOpinionNeo-Liberalism and Human RightsPatrick O’Connor QCDoughty Street ChambersDemocracy; Human rights; Jurisprudence; Liberalism; Social justiceAbstract“Neo-liberalism” is a powerful but amorphous ideology. There is no such thing as a “neo-liberal”jurisprudence and very little has been written about its legal perspectives. Save for regular polemicsagainst the Human Rights Act, even less has been written about its approach to human rights. The existingliterature from F.A. Hayek, Keith Joseph and Jonathan Sumption to Richard Posner, Roger Scruton andPolicy Exchange will be considered. We will focus upon neo-liberal hostility to “socio- economic” rightsand ambivalence about democracy. The underlying social values will be examined, in order to understandthe basis for these positions. We will ask what contribution neo-liberal thinking can make to human rightsin the 21st century.Neo-liberalismIn seeking to understand the relationship of neo-liberalism with the law generally, and with human rightsin particular, we need briefly to summarise its basic economic and political beliefs.1“Liberalism” has a long and honourable tradition of protecting individual liberty. Perhaps the classictexts are John Locke’s Two Treatises on Government of 1689, and J.S.. Mill’s On Liberty of 1859.2 Interms of economic theory, the classical “laissez faire” approach to the “free market” allowed a “spontaneousorder” to develop, which could only be harmed by outside interference, no matter how well intentioned.This softened into a “social liberalism” associated with increasing welfare provision by the state in the20th century. President Roosevelt’s “New Deal” in 1933–1936, and the “deficit financing” advocated byeconomist J. M. Keynes, epitomised this development.“Neo-liberalism” began as a “monetarist” reaction to those received views, initiated by “Austrian school”economists, von Mises and F.A. Hayek, and Milton Friedman of the “Chicago school”. After the centraleconomic planning necessary to secure victory in the Second World War, they saw the world in binaryterms: a drift through social democracy to Soviet Central Planning, or a revival of a “classical liberal”fundamentalist view of the role of government. This founded the familiar politics of the last forty yearsin the UK, the USA and more widely: deregulation, tax cuts, and broad challenges to the welfare stateand trade unions. Their extreme individualism and hostility to collectivism was the basis for Thatcher’sdenial of the existence of “civil society”.The most prominent neo-liberal tenet is minimising state regulation of the “free market”, which is seenas tending inevitably towards totalitarian planning and thus destroying individual liberty. “Freedom” is1 It is impossible to avoid over-simplification of many complex ideas here, in order to sketch historical developments by way of broad background.For those who doubt the existence of any coherent set of ideas meriting this name, see Andrew Glyn, Capitalism Unleashed: Finance, Globalization,and Welfare, (Oxford: OUP, 2006); Ostry, Loungani and Furceri, “Neoliberalism: Oversold”, IMF Research Paper, June 2016: and Stephen Metcalf,“Neoliberalism: the idea that swallowed the world”, The Guardian, 18 August 2017. There is a wealth of wider academic commentary.2 John Locke, Two Treatises on Government, (Cambridge: CUP, 1988); J. S. Mill and S. Collini (ed.) ‘On Liberty’ and Other Writings (CambridgeTexts in the History of Political Thought), (Cambridge: CUP, 1989).541[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthe protean watchword, but, as we shall see, this comes to be curiously defined. This ideology has playeda crucial role in globalisation, especially in finance, through its combined hostility to nation-state powers,and to supra-national regulatory bodies (on the basis that they lack democratic legitimacy). Ironically,those other supra-national agencies, the IMF and the World Bank, have been instrumental in widelyimposing neo-liberal economic orthodoxy upon national governments.The central fiction behind the deep penetration of neo-liberal economic theory into our national life isthat of the free agent, who makes fully informed and “rational choices” in the marketplace. Everything isa “deal”. Everyone is a “customer”, even school pupils and court users.As Dr Corinne Blalock explains:“Under neoliberalism, the measures and values of the market are used to index the success of thestate and its citizens. Diverging from the constitutional ideal that state power derives from consentby and representation of the people, the state’s authority is both founded on and progressively limitedto its ability to guarantee proper conditions for economic activity and individual prosperity.Correspondingly, the democratic will of the people is cast as irrelevant to economic affairs and asharmful if mobilized to intervene in pursuit of social goals. AsMargaret Thatcher declared, in perhapsthe most famous articulation of neoliberal ideology, ‘There is no such thing as society’.”3Though, at the time of his writing, F.A. Hayek may not have acknowledged the term, two of his majorworks became the received texts for “neo-liberalism”. These are “The Road to Serfdom”,4 and “TheConstitution of Liberty”.5 Margaret Thatcher is reported to have declared “This is what we believe!” inrelation to the latter. From 1974 with this inspiration, Keith Joseph, and his Centre for Policy Studiesprovided the intellectual backbone for Thatcherism. The time came for “neo-liberalism”with the electionsof Thatcher and Reagan respectively in 1979 and 1981.The neo-liberal posture towards state power and the law is more complex than the rhetoric of blanketopposition. As Hayek himself readily accepted, the “free market” could never have been maintainedwithout active state promotion. He described “laissez- faire” and “non-intervention” as “old formulae”.6Neo-liberalism and the lawWe will look in vain for a comprehensive articulation or analysis of a “neo-liberal” theory of law andhuman rights in the modern world.7 Professor Moyn has examined the striking parallels between the globalrise of the international human rights movement and of neo-liberalism: not least one of timing in the1970s.8 He concludes that the former was the ‘powerless companion’ to this triumph. He attributes thisto the narrow focus upon state abuses, and the absence of any effective agenda for ‘socio- economic’rights, which could curtail the manifest social injustices and inequalities of neo-liberal hegemony. Thelens has not yet been reversed, to scrutinise any neo-liberal concept of human rights.This paucity of exposition and of critical analysis is surprising since neo-liberal based legal argumentscan have a dramatic impact. In the 1930s, Roosevelt’s “new deal” of business regulation and social welfare,was besieged by successful Supreme Court challenges as a “threat to liberty” and a “socialist incursion”.3Blalock, “Neoliberalism and the crisis of legal theory”, in Law and Contemporary Problems, (2014) 77(4) Duke Law, 71.4 F.

In NFIB v Sebelius,10 they just failed to neuter the Obamacare legislation. The UKHouse of Lords decision in Bromley LBC v Greater London Council (GLC)11 declared illegal the GLC’ssubsidised “fares fair” policy, in part as failing to accord sufficient weight to the interests of ratepayers.No doubt, similar challenges could be brought against any future radical economic policies in the UK.HayekThe clearest exposition is by F.A. Hayek himself in The Constitution of Liberty, Part II: Freedom and theLaw.12 He believed in “equality before the law,” and the “rule of law”13; and that the government shouldbe subject to the law: i.e. a “rechsstraat” rather than the kind of tyranny permitted under “legal positivism”.14He confessed himself a believer in “natural law”, “Whether … in divine inspiration or in the inherentpowers of human reason, or in principles which are not themselves part of human reason…”.15 He was anadmirer of the US Constitution.16Without necessarily recognising them as positive rights, or setting them out systematically, Hayekexpressly acknowledges the importance of due process, habeas corpus, a free press, freedom of religion,no retrospective punishments, and recognition of a sphere of private life. No doubt he would also recognisemany of the interests protected by other provisions of the ECHR as legitimate.Not surprisingly for a theorist of the “free market”, he highlights rights of property and the limits toexpropriation.17 From this basis, he recognises a right closely akin to art.8 of the ECHR:“The recognition of private … property is thus an essential condition for the prevention of coercion,though by no means the only one…the recognition of a protected individual sphere has in times offreedom normally included a right to privacy and secrecy, the conception that a man’s house is hiscastle and that nobody has a right even to take cognizance of his activities within it.”18Hayek and “coercion”.There is a crucial conceptual flaw in Hayek’s account, which depends almost entirely upon his conceptof “coercion’” and the place he gives it. The touchstone of individual liberty, he says, is “the absence ofcoercion by another”19 and “Our definition of liberty depends upon the meaning of the concept of coercion,and it will not be precise until we have similarly defined that term.”20He suggests a meaning: “… such control of the environment or circumstances of a person by anotherthat, in order to avoid greater evil, he is forced to act not according to a coherent plan of his own but toserve the ends of another….. Coercion occurs when one man’s actions are made to serve another man’swill, not for his own but for the other’s purpose by the threat of inflicting harm.”21Hayek sets himself strongly against the law as an instrument for the advance of social justice, on thegrounds of its necessary “coercive” state powers.9Citizens United v FEC 558 U.S. 310 (2010).10NFIB v Sebelius 567 U.S. 519 (2012).11Bromley LBC v Greater London Council [1982] 2 W.L.R. 62.12Hayek, TCOL, pp.133–-252.13Hayek, TCOL, p.164.14Hayek, TCOL, pp.236–241.15Hayek, TCOL, p.237.16Hayek, TCOL, p.191–2.17Hayek, TCOL, p.217.18Hayek, TCOL, p.140–142.19Hayek, TCOL, p.133.20Hayek, TCOL, p.20.21Hayek, TCOL, p.133–5.Opinion 543[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors“Within the limits set by the rule of law, a great deal can be done to make the market work moreeffectively and smoothly; but, within these limits, what people now regard as distributive justice cannever be achieved … The law must not be used to further a policy of social improvement.”22and“It would scarcely be an exaggeration to say that the greatest danger to liberty today comes from themen who are most needed and most powerful in modern government, namely, the efficient expertadministrators exclusively concerned with what they regard as the public good.”23He accepts that the coercive powers of the state can inevitably be used for many proper purposes,without violating the “rule of law”, e.g. taxation and compulsory military service and jury service,24 becausethese are known powers and, either avoidable or, at least not arbitrarily imposed by one person.However, a problem arises over the boundaries for these many inevitable concessions. He abjures anyblanket abstention of the law and state “coercive powers” from issues of basic deprivation and need.“All modern governments have made provision for the indigent, unfortunate, and disabled and haveconcerned themselves with questions of health and the dissemination of knowledge. There is noreason why the volume of these pure service activities should not increase with the general growthof wealth. There are common needs that can be satisfied only by collective action and which can bethus provided for without restricting individual liberty.”25He wrote that freedom is consistent with “… the use of coercion by government for the sole purposeof enforcing known rules intended to secure the best conditions under which the individual may give hisactivities a coherent, rational pattern.”26 There is much potential for benevolent state action here.The problem for Hayek and subsequent writers is how to define these boundaries. He ultimately acceptsthat the term “coercion” poses many difficulties: “But coercion is nearly as troublesome a concept asliberty itself…”.27 He is reduced to preventing “all the more severe forms of coercion”,28 which begs manyquestions. This test of “improper coercion’” therefore loses its explanatory power as the touchstone of“freedom’”. This is however Hayek’s central criticism of the use of the law to promote social justice andfor “redistributive” purposes. Stripped of this reasoning, there is the bare assertion, unfounded on anyprinciple, that “social justice” is not where the law should go. Thus, Hayek’s limited structure for theprotection of liberty proves to have very uncertain foundations. 29“Coercion” is still used as a key neo-liberal concept, despite having been very widely criticised.30However, the failure of this attempt to conceptualise the protections for freedom in “negative” terms, andthus to avoid recognising “positive rights”, has not been rectified with any alternative.22Hayek, TCOL, pp.232–3 and 243.23Hayek, TCOL, p.262.24Hayek, TCOL, p.143.25Hayek, TCOL, p.257.26Hayek, TCOL, p.144 and more widely.27Hayek, TCOL, p.133.28Hayek, TCOL, p.139.29Hayek lived a long and most prolific life. Unsurprisingly, he was not entirely consistent in everything he wrote. For a more detailed critical analysis,see Roland Kley, Hayek’s Social and Political Thought, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994) Chs 1–5.30By way of example:Ellen Frankel Paul, “Hayek’s Conception of Freedom, Coercion and the Rule of Law”, Reason Papers No. 6 (Spring, 1980) Miami University,37–52; Hamowy, “Hayek’s Concept of Freedom: a Critique”, New Individualist Review (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1981);Bouillon, “Breaking thecircle: the definition of individual liberty”, Ethics and Politics, 2003, 2; Fukuyama, “Friedrich A. Hayek, Big Government Skeptic” [sic], New YorkTimes, 5 June 2011.544 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsHayek and “justice”The concept of “justice” also receives a curious definition at the hands of Hayek. “Injustice” can onlyresult from the actions of a person, he suggests. However, the “free market” is not the result of humancalculation, but the natural evolution of a “spontaneous order” (thus a “natural order of things”, and beyondchallenge or criticism). The free market therefore cannot produce “injustice”. Since no “injustice” arises,it is beyond the purview of the law to provide any remedy. Further, it would be a violation of the “rule oflaw” to attempt to do so. 31 He argues:“Since only situations which have been created by human will can be called just or unjust, theparticulars of a spontaneous order cannot be just or unjust……what is called social or distributivejustice is indeedmeaningless within a spontaneous order and hasmeaning only within an organisation.”Similarly, as Hayek says, the misfortunes of nature, such as a “physical defect” from birth, cannot beregarded as “unjust”. We see here the basis for neo- liberal hostility to equality of opportunity, and toremedies for social disadvantage or for “discrimination.” The misfortunes of nature or of “society” arenot “injustices” and should not be remedied by the law.Hayek and the real worldSo much for theoretical deficiencies, but in practice and in terms of human rights, Hayek’s ideas took himin some eccentric directions. He argued that the Nazi regime was truly a form of socialism, and blamed“old socialists” for its rise to power.32 He justified the analysis because Hitler was pursuing “an idea ofsocial justice” (sic).33 He wrote in 1943 at the height of the war, that “The Rule of Law has never been soseverely threatened than it is today.” Many would agree, but not perhaps with his identification of thethen sources of that threat: the novelist J. B. Priestley, Professor Harold Laski at the LSE and “the currentprogramme of the Labour Party”. They were described as “the totalitarians in our midst”. 34In 1976, he described the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, granting trade union immunity for the economicimpact of strike action, as “the most fateful law in Britain’s modern history”; and shocking to “… theBritish constitutional tradition probably more than any other act of modern legislative history …”35Between 1950 and 1962, Hayek taught and wrote at the University of Chicago. From his work withMilton Friedman and others, a “Chicago School” of economics emerged. Inspired by their “free market”theories, and the perceived “threat” to them from the elected socialist Allende government in Chile, GeneralPinochet headed a violent military coup in 1973. The dictatorship lasted until 1990 and was responsiblefor 3,000 deaths and disappearances, with 80,000 people subjected to arbitrary detention and institutionaltorture.This form of “coercion” did not seem to concern Hayek. He visited Chile in 1977 and 1981, meetingthe military leaders, as he did the Argentinian junta. He wrote in public defence of the South Africanapartheid regime and the Chilean dictatorship: “If Mrs. Thatcher said that free choice is to be exercisedmore in the market place than in the ballot box, she has merely uttered the truism that the first isindispensable for individual freedom, while the second is not.”36Chile did not stand alone. In pursuit of “free market” interests, the US and UK engineered the overthrowof moderate democratic regimes in Iran in 1953 and Guatemala 1954 and others, in favour of enduring31 F. A.

The public apologies ofthe US government in 1999 and 2000, for its role in these coups, do not dispel the apparent neo-liberalview that these victims were a price worth paying for higher “free market” values. 37 Basic human rightsand democracy were simply cast aside.Hayek took a casual view of the suspension of basic human rights. They were not “… absolute rightswhich could never be infringed..” but “… any departure from them requires special justification…when,but only when, it is a question of preserving liberty in the long run … in situations of ‘clear and presentdanger’.”Although he suggested that the suspension should be reviewable by an independent court, he does notconcern himself with any attempt to clarify the “public interest” criteria which should be applied. Heproceeded predictably with a much more detailed insistence that the owners of expropriated propertyshould receive full indemnification: “as high as possible”.38ScrutonMore recently, the English philosopher, Roger Scruton has sporadically written about the common- lawand human rights. As a member of the Mont Pelerin Society, founded by Hayek, he may be taken as“flying the flag” for an updated version of his views. He has long courted controversy for his opinionsabout multi-culturalism and the “existential threat” of Islam to Christian Europe.Two essays on Scruton’s personal website from 2011 and 2014 address human rights. This is sadly thinmaterial. He acknowledges the “natural law” basis for “traditional freedoms”, from the English Bill ofRights, through the American Bill of Rights and UN Universal Declaration to the European Convention.However, he draws a clear boundary at the socio- economic rights in art.22 of the Declaration becausethey found positive claims against the state, rather than negative “freedoms”: and enlarge state powers.As he puts it: “If there are such things as ‘natural rights’, therefore, they ought to have the essentiallynegative aspect of freedoms: rights not to be molested, rather than claims to be fulfilled.”Is this distinction workable? Even Scruton must require that his “traditional negative freedoms” beeffective, and so positively enforceable against the state or other oppressors by a “claim’. The distinctionfrom what he calls “claim rights” is entirely unclear. The very ancient common law rights to a “fair trial”and to a public investigation of a suspicious death at an Inquest are both “positive” rights, enforceable by“claims”. More recently, the Supreme Court has powerfully endorsed the positive right of unimpededaccess to the courts, basing itself upon ancient and modern common law: R. (Unison) v Lord Chancellor.39The successful arguments in the “Citizens United” decision were based upon the positive right of “freespeech” in the American First Amendment. Are these rights objectionable in principle because they maybe depicted as positive “claim rights”? So many “rights” can anyway be couched in positive or negativeterms, by a simple switch of language.Scruton continues: “claim rights push us inevitably in a direction which, for many people, is not onlyeconomically disastrous, but morally and politically dangerous. Moreover it is a direction which isdiametrically opposed to that for which the idea of a human (natural) right was originally introduced —a direction involving the increase, rather than the limitation, of the power of the state.”It is counter-intuitive to imagine that socio-economic claims against the state enlarge state powers.Bathetically, Scruton’s complaint focuses upon the powers of taxation to finance welfare support. Heignores those many passages in Hayek which justify such state powers for precisely these reasons. He37 Shortly after the coups, the “evils” of those overthrown regimes were cited by neo-liberals in their negotiation of international trade regulation:Slobodian, The Globalists, (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2018), p.139.38Hayek, TCOL, p.217.39R. (on the application of Unison) v Lord Chancellor [2017] UKSC 51; [2017] 3 W.L.R. 409 at [66]–[85].546 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorscomplains that “The agenda has shifted from liberalism to socialism, without any indication of why orhow.”Scruton criticises art.8 of the European Convention as “wish fulfilment” “now applied by an activistcourt (the European Court of Human Rights) which aims to upset any piece of legislation that might havegot up the nose of its far from impartial, and in any case highly politicized, judges.” He claims that “anygrievance” can be turned “into an enforceable claim without reference to the wider issues of the publicinterest. Rights … can therefore be wielded against the state, regardless of the interests that conflict withthem.”In his hyperbole, Scruton forgets that Hayek himself recognised something akin to a liberal reading ofart.8 ECHR.40 He also ignores the highly qualified terms of art.8, which in nearly every single case requirecareful assessment of balance and proportionality against other conflicting public and/or private interests.Predictably, Scruton illustrates his concerns with the story of a planning dispute in his country villageinvolving Irish travellers, EU freedom of movement and the “collapse of property values” locally. Theremay or may not be sympathy for losing such a case, but this is a paltry basis for a legal treatise. He doesnot attach, or give a reference for, the court’s decision.The finding of “implied obligations” within the European Convention presumably justifies the attributionof “activism” against the judiciary. These obligations maintain rights as effective and relevant in changingtimes. The alternative is an “originalism” which freezes any legislation as at the moment of its enactment:a built-in obsolescence. In passing the Human Rights Act, and including a judicial duty to “take intoaccount” Strasburg Court decisions, Parliament clearly approved the long established “living instrument”approach of that Court.41Scruton is rightly an admirer of the flexibility and pragmatic development of the common law. Thatmust include many ancient and more modern positive “common law” rights, and negative freedoms. Itwould be anomalous and unworkable for those rights to be interpreted according to living, flexible andpragmatic criteria, while European Convention rights are tied to a rigid “originalist” approach. Thisespecially applies to those many rights which arise in parallel from both sources.Neo-liberal thinkers seem anxious to assert the “right to discriminate” in rebuttal of any obligation of“equal treatment”. Hayek described equality of opportunity as a “wholly illusory ideal” and “liable toproduce a nightmare”.42Neo-liberals conventionally insist that “the whole of life is discrimination”. This is so, if the treatmentof people is reduced to the level of consumer choice. Scruton complains that “Things are made morecomplex still by the inclusion, in all European provisions, of ‘non-discrimination’ as a human right. …(he cites employment, education and hospital beds)…But all coherent societies are based on discrimination.A society is an ‘in-group’, however large and however hospitable it may be. Non-discrimination lawseffectively tie the hands of the indigenous European communities, forbidding them from offering privilegesto their existing members.”43 Even in the heat of battle, common humanity extends impartial medicaltreatment to all combatants, as required by the Geneva Conventions and military law.44 This can be tracedback to the 1864, Geneva Convention, art.6. It seems not to survive in 21st century neo-liberalism. In fact,F. A. Hayek himself at one stage was insistent that people should be treated equally and that discriminationin the laws themselves and in their application is unacceptable.45Scruton’s somewhat dyspeptic summation of the current position is:40Hayek, TCOL, p.142.41As Lord Dyson pointed out in his Bentham Presidential address, “Are the judges too powerful?”, UCL Laws, 2014, p.10, . at https://www.ucl.ac.uk/laws/sites/laws/files/dyson_2014.pdf [Accessed on 10 November 2018].42Hayek, LLL, Vol. 2, p.84.43 “The Religion of Rights”, Radio 4, 1 September 2017, reproduced on Scruton’s website.44Geneva Convention I, 1949, arts. 12 and 15: GC II, 1949, arts 12 and 18: Additional Protocol I, 1977, art. 10: AP II, 1977, arts. 7 and 8.45Hayek, TCOL, pp.153-4Opinion 547[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors“The doctrine of human rights, which was introduced to guarantee our freedom, is now being usedto remove it. Religious fanatics and Leftist utopians have combined to subvert the only weapon thathas until now been effective against them.”A recent sermon of his revealed the limited progress made towards any coherent legal theory.46 Scrutonsuggested that two sources of the common law were: a summary of what may be assumed between twopeople in “free dealings” with each other: and, citing St Augustine, “divine revelation” to us as naturalbeings. Perhaps this does not take anyone very far.Richard PosnerThe fascinating Judge Richard Posner of the Chicago Court of Appeals merits brief mention. He was amaverick pragmatist, who avowedly paid “… very little attention to legal rules, statutes, constitutionalprovisions.”47 He straddled neo-liberal and opposing positions in his prolific writings and judgments. Hewrote two very successful books under the influence of Chicago school economists. Economic Analysisof Law48 and The Economics of Justice49 explained his view that the law generally could benefit from anacceptance of economic analysis: not to promote a “just” or utilitarian agenda, but with a view to“efficiency” and “wealth maximisation”.This took Posner into eccentric territory with his advocacy of a formal market in babies, to rectify thedefects in the adoption system.50 Perhaps he gains a little more credit for his strong criticism of JusticeScalia and his “textual originalism”.51 However, attempting to extract any legal principle from such a“legal pragmatist” will likely prove to be an oxymoron.Joseph and SumptionNeo-liberal hostility to the current state of human rights lawmay be founded upon irreconcileable theoreticalconflict. These objections may also be based upon a more instinctive elitism: a preference for “subjects”with their petitions, rather than “citizens” with their troublesome “rights” and “claims”: a neo- liberalview of human nature, and social values. Those values normally remain discreetly coded.Fortunately, a remarkable and indiscreet book called Equality attempted to explain and justify them.52Keith Joseph was the joint author with Jonathan Sumption, then an academic and barrister. He wrote mostof the text, and has been an influential Justice of the UK Supreme Court.53 Both were trained as lawyersand called to the Bar, (as was Scruton). The legal implications of their views, especially with regard tosocio-economic rights, cannot have been far from their minds.Keith Joseph had history. On 19 October 1974, he delivered a revealing speech in Edgbaston, whichwas disastrous for his then ambitions. He reflected on the “moral” state of Britain: “The balance of ourpopulation, our human stock is threatened … a high and rising proportion of children are being born tomothers least fitted to bring children into the world and bring them up … who were first pregnant inadolescence in social classes 4 and 5.… Some are of low intelligence, most of low educational attainment.… They are producing problem children, the future unmarried mothers, delinquents, denizens of our46Temple Church Sermon, entitled The Law of the Land, 3 October 2018, https://www.roger-scruton.com/articles/548-the-law-of-the-land-the-temple-church-sermon-3-oct-18 [Accessed 10 November 2018].47 Interview of Posner with Adam Liptiak, New York Times, 11 September 2017 and see “Rhetoric and Law.

In the 1980s, official papers recordJoseph as proposing a “managed rundown” of Merseyside, in answer to Michael Heseltine’s plans forre-generation.54 This was a man flirting with mass social cleansing, and basing himself in part on the elitistvalue he placed upon genetics and “intelligence”.Joseph and Sumption declared in Equality that they were advancing “apparently shocking and offensivepropositions”.55 Joseph insisted upon postponing publication until after the 1979 election, for fear of thepublic reaction.56 A small selection of these “apparently shocking..propositions” reveals why.“It is more comforting to think that one is poor because one belongs to the class whose lot is to bepoor.”;“It is because of the existence of envy that one does not drive Rolls-Royces through the slums ofNaples.”;“Redistribution is unwise. But it is also morally indefensible, misconceived in theory and repellentin practice.”;“A family is poor if it cannot afford to eat. It is not poor if it cannot afford endless smokes … Byany absolute standard, there is very little poverty in Britain today.”;“‘Politics’ and ‘scholarship’ are fields ‘in which human achievement would be the poorer for wantof men of independent means.”;“The level of a community’s civilization is very much the level of civilization of its most discerningand original members [who] must enjoy incomes significantly higher than the average.”;“A person is morally entitled to everything he can acquire from free agents by honest means.”;“An unusually skilled businessman … will require a far greater income in order to achieve personalfulfillment than will another who has not been so well favoured by nature and who will be moreeasily fulfilled.”;“Self interest is indeed the first duty which a man owes to his community, so that he supports himselfand does not depend on others … It is not wealth but envy which is divisive.”This is an impoverished view of human nature and society. Supposedly, we must live as “free”autonomous individuals, pursuing our personal ambitions and material wealth, as in a “cage fight” againstour neighbours. The state is merely a distant referee to ensure that things do not get too far out of hand.This was a “moral” catechism for the unlimited acquisition and consumption of recent decades. In theentire book, just three sentences address the needs of some limited categories of the most vulnerable, inhighly qualified terms. Hayek’s recognition of some legitimate state powers for these purposes is notacknowledged.“Freedom” and “equality”Joseph and Sumption posit “freedom” as irreconcilable with “equality”. The litmus test of a “free society”is its “inequality”: i.e. the extent to which it fosters and protects the accumulation of private wealth.54According to released government papers: Sally Gainsbury, Financial Times ( December 30, 2011).”Tories debated letting Liverpool ‘decline’”.55 Joseph and Sumption, Equality, p.103.56Denham and Garnett, Keith Joseph, (Chesham, Acumen, 2001), p.329: from the publishers’ archives.Opinion 549[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsSocio-economic rights are clearly anathema. Exploitation and discrimination are unrecognised, and thustolerated.Democracy does not feature in this version of a “free society”. According to the authors, “It may bethat the rich recognize that their interests are served by political stability and that political stability canonly be had if the differences between rich and poor are kept within bounds. If so, then redistribution isjustified to the limited extent that it is necessary for the purpose of achieving that object. But its justificationgoes not one inch further”.57 Revenue would be controlled in the interests of the rich, who should be thesole arbiters of their own perceived self interest in ‘political stability’ and of any necessary redistribution.58The authors find it inconvenient to explain the practical workings of this curious system.In order to set up this manichean choice between “freedom” and “equality”, each is defined so as to bein direct opposition. This carefully crafted conflict is thus tautological, to fit the authors’ purpose. “Freedom”is defined so as to exclude any feature of ‘inequality”: so a blind man has “freedom” to read a book: anda man is truly “free” if, from his wages, he cannot afford bread.59 Joseph and Sumption dismiss moderatesocial democrats as failing to beware the slippery slope to inevitable totalitarianism. This approach setthe scene for the neo-liberal crusade against the perceived suffocating compromises of post-war socialdemocracy.SourcesIt is perhaps not surprising that the bare propositions advanced by Joseph and Sumption can be seen as“off the spectrum” of conventional right-wing political discourse. They are indistinguishable from thoseof Ayn Rand, the cult figure of the American extreme right, whom many regarded as unhinged. Shecondemned altruism and praised “the virtue of selfishness”. Rand directed the full range of her contemptat this concept of “equality”. She suggested that altruists “… seek to deprive men of their consequences— of the rewards, the benefits, the achievements created by personal attributes and virtues. It is not equalitybefore the law that they seek, but inequality: the establishment of an inverted social pyramid, with a newaristocracy on top — the aristocracy of non-value”. She added: “There is no such thing as a benevolentpassion for equality and… the claim to it is only a rationalisation to cover a passionate hatred of the goodfor being the good”.60The topic, the timing and the tone of these parallel works suggest Rand’s influence, but this is notacknowledged. Hayek is avowedly the inspiration. Joseph’s and Sumption’s characterisations of povertyand the working class have deeper roots. They are reminiscent of the 17th century thinker, BernardMandeville: “Men who are to remain and end their days in a laborious, tiresome and painful station oflife, the sooner they are put upon it, the more patiently they’ll submit to it for ever after.”61One of the central fictions of neo-liberal economic theory is that of the free agent, who makes fullyinformed and “rational choices” in the marketplace. This imagined “free market” does not bear muchresemblance to our consumer and investor experience and has been refuted by the research of manyeconomists and psychologists, such as Daniel Kahneman. 62 The wider “neo-liberal” project seeks to applythis “rational choice” fiction to every aspect of our lives. If everything is a “deal” and everyone is a“customer”, most aspects of social policy and legal rights follow with cold logic. The poor and the57 Joseph and Sumption, Equality, p.102.58Orwell explained this “fear of the mob” in Down and Out in Paris and London, (Penguin Classics, 2013), Ch.22.59Both emerge from Hayek’s concept of “justice”, as explained above.60Ayn Rand, “Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution”, in The Age of Envy, (New York: New American Library, 1975), at p.140and p.144.61Bernard Mandeville, The Fable of the Bees, 3rd edn, (London, 1724), p.329. Mandeville opposed charity schools for the poor. He was a writer ofgreat interest to F.A. Hayek, see his British Academy annual Lecture on a mastermind (OUP, 1966).62 For example, see D.

Morally they deserve theirplight: “the poor are to blame”. This is a “hostile environment” for any “rights”.The “moral blame” of the disadvantaged is a familiar comfort for the privileged. Joseph himself, asEducation Secretary in 1984, refused to channel money for the training of young women for science,saying “I do not believe that money is the problem: it is the attitude of parents and the girls themselves.”This is a potent motif. Sumption’s most provocative recent comments partly attributed lack of judicialdiversity to, what he termed, the “perfectly legitimate lifestyle choice” of women lawyers, who are unwillingto endure the rigours of successful private legal practice.63This “world view” precludes any recognition of vulnerability, disadvantage or exploitation: and thereforeof any measures to rectify them. Joseph and Sumption make this clear: “Equality of opportunity (it is said)is a fine thing … but it can be achieved only by equalising standards of living, therefore in order to createtrue equality of opportunity one must prevent the ablest from achieving their full potential … broadlyspeaking … all the brave new experiments in manufacturing equality by educational manipulation [haveproduced] little or no effect. … institutional factors have no appreciable effect upon achievement … Atno point in their lives are men equal in ability and capacity to exploit the opportunities which all equallyenjoy. Nor at any point in their lives can they be made so”.64These are powerful elitist assumptions, with strong social policy consequences. The desirability, oreven possibility, of overcoming social disadvantage and discrimination is vigorously denied.More generallyin Equality, it is futile to try to find any reference to the position of women at all, save for the “derivedwealth” of a woman living with a husband “on his large income”. In this “empathy free” zone, the pooror vulnerable do not belong: nor does any provision for them, such as social housing.In its resistance to market forces, social housing became a crucible for neo- liberal hostility. The valuesbehind this hostility have had real consequences. In 1979, the Conservative Chair of Kensington andChelsea Council Housing Committee declared that “Middle income people are the life blood of our nation”and needed help against the encroachments of “the subsidised poor”.65This was followed by theWestminsterCouncil “homes for votes” scandal in 1987, in which the poor were treated as pawns in an electoral powergame. These values are now emerging as a factor in the Grenfell catastrophe.Joseph and Sumption wrote: “the fact that bread is a necessity of life whereas books are not, may wellbe a very good reason for helping out on humanitarian grounds those who cannot afford it, but it cannotbe a reason for saying that such people are not free”.66 The futility of such a concept of “freedom” couldnot be better expressed. The lofty conditional (“may well be”) is so telling. This account of neo-liberalvalues does not sit easily with any universal human rights at all.Policy Exchange and Hayek.Policy Exchange, an influential, so-called “centre-right” think-tank, has recently published a criticalaccount of “human rights” law. 67 It established a Judicial Power Project, whose basic premise is “risingconcern at judicial overreach”. Under this aegis, the paper by Noel Malcolm, a historian and journalist,purports to discover the predicated “rising concern at judicial overreach”.Malcolm argues that “human rights” are matters for political theory, and not moral philosophy: andthus can be “relativist”.68 He advocates leaving the ECHR, and establishing a Bill or Charter of UK rights.69That instrument would “be concerned only with real, essential human rights … the violation of which63Home Truths about Judicial Diversity, Bar Council Law Reform Lecture, 15 November 2012, p.11.64 Joseph and Sumption, Equality, pp.31–35.65 Time Out, London, 10–16 August 1979, p.7.66 Joseph and Sumption, Equality, p.49.67Noel Malcolm, Human Rights and Political Wrongs: a new approach to Human Rights law (Policy Exchange, 2017).68Malcolm, “Human Rights and Political Wrongs”, p.99–135.69Malcolm, “Human Rights and Political Wrongs”, p.139–140.Opinion 551[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorswould count as oppression and tyranny …” above a certain “… threshold of seriousness..” No attempt ismade to define “real, essential human rights” or “serious oppression or tyranny”. Yet again, a critic of theConvention finds it too embarrassing to spell out which of the rights should be eliminated. With painfulpredictability, the author’s two factual examples for exclusion involve “the other”: an asylum seeker beingdetained in poor conditions for two hours, and any positive state obligation to “facilitate one’s gypsyidentity.”70By way of compensation, a much more general “Code of Protected Rights” would be promulgated,ranging far beyond “the human ones” [sic] and the ECHR.71 On one reading, some undefined“socio-economic rights” would be included, with a principle of “non-discrimination.”72 Confusingly, thisimaginative suggestion is undermined on the same page, by the argument that increasing the extent ofrights reduces the extent of “…a decent, well- functioning democracy.” There are rather long odds againstany such a code seeing the light of day, in tandem with any post-Brexit Charter,.What is specifically “neo-liberal” about this paper, for there is only space here to deal with that legacy?Hayek is not mentioned once, and nor is “absence of coercion” as a touchstone of liberty. Malcolm doeshowever pursue a very Hayekian motif. The legal “coercive powers” of the state must be predictable orat least under “known rules.”73 Hayek argues that such knowledge is necessary to enable the individual toarrange his affairs, and the context betrays his relentless focus upon protecting property rights.Malcolm suggests that the predictability of legal rights is of vital importance. “And if we do possess abody of accurately defined and mutually coherent rights, we must also stand in need of reliable andobjective ways of applying those rights to the facts of any particular case, so that we may know preciselywhich right is involved, and what needs to be done in order to protect it… a system of just law mustinvolve a high degree of knowability and predictability.”74 He argues that this predictability is currentlyinadequate and compromised by laws requiring or permitting judicial “overreach”: namely judges assessingthe balance between competing rights and public and private interests.Malcolm does not claim to allow for the vast majority of disputes in our society which are never litigated,precisely because the legal answer is clear and acted upon by the parties. In the inevitable marginal orproblematic cases, he elides the obvious distinction between “known rules” or “known principles” and“known outcomes”. The accessibility and predictability of the law is a very important principle. However,no common law or civil code system can possibly clarify in advance the answers to the many and variedconflicts that arise in society. Malcolm suggests, to the contrary, that it would be helpful to specify inadvance each of the possible ways in which, for example, a ‘fair trial’ might be compromised. This isunrealistic, and involves a standard which cannot practically be applied to any area of the law, let aloneselectively to human rights law.75Malcolm cites one French post-adoption legal dispute involving issues of maternal anonymity.76 “Onedoes not need to enter into the specifics of many cases in order to sense that there is something deeplyproblematic about these ‘balancing’ exercises… Judgments in such cases are less like technical applicationsof settled law, and more like political decisions …”.This is simply absurd. Malcolm does not suggest who else should decide such issues other than a judgein a court of law: or any different mechanism which could credibly do so. These are neither “technicalapplications of settled law” nor “political decisions”. No pre- ordained “weighting” for the conflictinginterests could possibly cater for the complexities of life. Our Family Courts decide such difficult casesperfectly conventionally, balancing the common law and other rights of all relevant parties, in the context70Malcolm, “Human Rights and Political Wrongs”, p.141.71Malcolm, “Human Rights and Political Wrongs”, p.141–2.72 See also Malcolm, “Human Rights and Political Wrongs”, p.121.73Hayek, TRTS, Ch. VI, “Planning and the Rule of Law”, p.60.74Malcolm, “Human Rights and Political Wrongs”, pp.20 and 34.75Lord Dyson makes this point in his Bentham Presidential address, “Are the judges too powerful?”, UCL Laws, 2014, p.2.76Malcolm, “Human Rights and Political Wrongs”, pp.25–26.552 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsof statute, and applying them to the facts of the case. They have always been, and will be, obliged tobalance such interests with or without the Human Rights Act.Malcolm’s error is his suggestion that the judicial “balancing” of various rights and interests, is uniquelyproblematic and confined to “human rights” law. 77 He cites Daly v SSHD78 as a landmark introduction ofthe principle of “proportionality” into English law. However, the decision in that case was based firstupon “an orthodox application of common law principles”, after consideration of the balance betweenprisoner’s rights and the need to maintain discipline and security in prisons.79 If that “balancing exercise”of individual rights and the public interest at common law was not “judicial overreach”, then why does itbecome so when, a few paragraphs later, European Convention rights are considered? Is it “judicialoverreach”, for example, when the courts assess the boundaries of the common law “duty of care” or‘vicarious liability’ in the law of negligence? Both are replete with policy implications. Parliament iswelcome to legislate on all such issues, but has not done so.Surprisingly, Malcolm does not refer to the Kennedy case, an important decision of the Supreme Court,explaining the primary role of common- law rights, relative to Convention rights.80 Nor does he cite theSupreme Court decision in the Unison case, above, on access to the courts. This was decided primarilyon common- law constitutional principles, which were then confirmed by reference to EU and ECHR law.Malcolm, later and more realistically, concedes that there will always be “interpretative problems” forjudges, who will be obliged in some cases to make assessments of ‘balance’ with policy implications.81So, this vehement objection to the judicial balancing of interests, is reduced to a question of degree andnot of principle. Any degree of excess would require much more nuanced assessment than that given byMalcolm, in order to justify any criticism.What is clear is that such exercises are not confined to “human rights” cases, and are no symptom of“judicial overreach”. Nor are they the touted “threats to democratic values”, with which neo- liberalsanyway have a decidedly ambivalent history and opportunistic relationship. Another such unfoundedaccusation of “judicial overreach”, specifically regarding judicial review, was advanced by JonathanSumption in 2011, and refuted by Lord Justice Sedley and Lord Dyson.82TomBingham and Aharon Barak were respectively Presidents of the UK and the Israeli Supreme Courts.They were amongst the most internationally respected of judges of the last century, with a combinedexperience of 56 years at the highest levels of the judiciary. They each adopted a purposive approach tothe interpretation of human rights instruments. Throughout their careers, they had been obliged to resolvethe most anxious of conflicts between public and private interests and rights, by balancing them on thefacts of each case. They have written and spoken with unquestionable integrity about the importance andlegitimacy of these tasks.83 Neither was engaged in anti-democratic empire building. It would take rathermore than the efforts of Scruton, Sumption and Malcolm so far to bring home any charge of judicial“overreach”.77Malcolm, “Human Rights and Political Wrongs”, pp.24–29.78R.

They were established and are maintained under the neo-liberal flags of “freedom”and hostility to regulation.With characteristic restraint, Hayek suggested that the imposition of “exchange controls” on themovement of money across borders would be “the decisive advance on the path to totalitarianism and thesuppression of individual liberty.”86 He placed “distributive justice” beyond the pale of his “rule of law”.Joseph and Sumption followed suit.The immediate post-war construction of international trade regulation was dominated by organisedneo- liberal influence. This included the drafting of what was called a “Magna Carta” of private investorrights.87 Perhaps the most important relationship between neo-liberalism and the law, is the ability tofashion legislative agendas and pre-empt inconvenient developments. This is how it is done. The role ofthe Mont Pelerin Society would be the stuff of a bad novel, but an engrossing documentary. It wasestablished by Hayek at a meeting in Switzerland in 1947. Its immediate concern was the potential seizureof private property by western social democratic governments, inspired by the example of post-war easternEurope. It has since exercised quite extraordinary influence, lobbying through neo-liberal power networksand proliferating, well-funded “think-tanks”.88Today, the de facto freedoms of wealthy individuals and corporations are legion, from ineffective tax,market and accounting regulation, to the remarkable abstention of the criminal law after the 2008 bankingcrisis. These are the outcomes of the neo-liberal success in achieving our de-regulated, financialised andglobalised world. The revelations of the “Panama Papers” are only the tip of an iceberg. The nexus betweenthis ideology and current practice was well put by Nicholas Shaxson, in his recent study of offshorefinancial centres and tax havens. He describes their beneficiaries as “members of ancient continentalaristocracies, fanatical supporters of American libertarian Ayn Rand,…. global criminals,….. Its bugbearsare government, laws and taxes and its slogan “freedom”.”89The insistence upon strong “negative” rights, and hostility to “positive” or “claim” rights, reflects arather crude conflict of material interest. The rich and powerful want their assets negatively protectedfrom control or diminution. The needy and vulnerable require positive provision and protection, whichhas to be funded. Beyond such interests, what is the principled objection to positive socio- economicrights?We have seen how the boundary between positive and negative rights is unworkable, and certainly notmaintained generally by neo-liberals. We have seen how Hayek’s categorisation of redistribution asinvolving “improper coercive state powers” and thus in defiance of the “rule of law” has fallen apart. Wehave seen how the many predictions of totalitarian doom have proved empty, and “historicist”. So perhapsthis simply comes down to realpolitik without legal principle.84Bentham Presidential address,Are the judges too powerful?, UCL Laws, 2014, p.7.85Hayek, LLL, Vol. 3, p.1–2.86Hayek, TRTS, p.69.87 See Quinn Slobodian, The Globalists, (Harvard, 2018), Ch. 4, pp.121–145 and Arthur S.

Joseph and Sumption suggest: “Statistical demonstrations [of wealth and incomedistribution] are an appeal to envy and an abuse of people’s dissatisfactions and disappointments… [and]likely to be unrewarding as well as irrelevant.”91 Even to prepare factually for an informed debate about“inequality” is, for them, to commit four cardinal sins: and all in the name of a “free society”.This moment“Human rights” now face dangerous cross-currents, which are too complex and fresh for analyticalperspective. The populist nationalism of Brexit will advance the cause for a UK Bill of Rights and theopportunity for narrower scope and weaker protection. Conor Gearty has lucidly explained this threat.92In some ways Brexit and rising populist nationalism run counter to the neo-liberal macro-economicproject. This was on the verge of carving up the world into supra-national trading blocks, beyond anyeffective democratic control, under such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).However, under that surface, there is an intense neo-liberal focus upon any post-Brexit world for the UK,with the prospect of low tax and low regulation bilateral trade deals. The dangers are equally clear forhuman rights as for employment and equality protections, and food and environmental standards.TheMalcolm paper for Policy Exchange shows how these forces can combine, taking over and adaptingHayek’s arguments in this new context. It is now more important than ever that the challenges of neo-liberal ideology be understood and resisted.ConclusionThe poverty of “neo-liberal” “human rights” theory may arise from several layers of incompatibility with“effective”, and even “formal”, human rights. The insistence, fromHayek to Scruton, upon purely “negative”freedoms and the resistance to “claim rights”, is purely doctrinal and unworkable. The continuing focusupon “absence of coercion” is no guide to which freedoms should be protected. The disregard for democracyand human rights, when convenient for the protection of the “free market”, taints the credibility of anyneo-liberal account of “freedoms”. Liberty is secured by the “rule of law” and vigorous democracy, notthe “rule of law” and “market forces”. The state cannot be regarded as the exclusive source of oppression,in our privatised, deregulated and profit-obsessed world. The dystopia of Joseph and Sumption sits uneasilywith any universal rights at all.The “human rights” movement (so called) has rightly been subjected to close testing for “fuzziness”over its conceptual foundations and the reach of its “rights”.93 By contrast, it may be a measure of thehegemony of “neo-liberalism” that there has been no significant critical account of its view of the law andhuman rights since Hayek and the debates he triggered. It would be gratifying if this article were to makea modest start to such a process.Neo-liberals may acquire a relevant “rights theory” when they grapple with protections from the“coercion” which ordinary citizens suffer today (if Hayek’s own concept is to be revived). Does “coercion”include a pension fund being destroyed in reckless corporate games; or exploitation by monopoly or riggedpricing; or deception by marketing devices; or the ruin of a career by race or gender discrimination; or90See from a burgeoning literature, Sen,Development as Freedom, (Oxford, OUP, 2001); Nussbaum,Creating capabilities: the HumanDevelopmentApproach, (Harvard University Press, 2011); Understanding human dignity, ed.

Hayek himself expressly included the firstthree, but the subtlety of some of his thinking has escaped later writers.94Lord Reed in the Unison decision, above, at paras. [66]–[73] felt obliged to deliver a basic lesson uponthe importance to society generally of the “rule of law”, and basic individual rights. It is striking that thelesson had to be addressed immediately to the practices and arguments of the Respondent, the LordChancellor, as responsible for the Ministry of Justice. This was also however a considered refutation ofthe set of ideas addressed in this article.He said at paras. [66]–[67]:“66. The constitutional right of access to the courts is inherent in the rule of law. The importanceof the rule of law is not always understood. Indications of a lack of understanding includethe assumption that the administration of justice is merely a public service like any other,that courts and tribunals are providers of services to the “users” who appear before them,and that the provision of those services is of value only to the users themselves and to thosewho are remunerated for their participation in the proceedings. The extent to which thatviewpoint has gained currency in recent times is apparent from the consultation papers andreports discussed earlier. It is epitomised in the assumption that the consumption of ET andEAT services without full cost recovery results in a loss to society, since ‘ET and EAT usedoes not lead to gains to society that exceed the sum of the gains to consumers and producersof these services’.67. It may be helpful to begin by explaining briefly the importance of the rule of law, and therole of access to the courts in maintaining the rule of law. It may also be helpful to explainwhy the idea that bringing a claim before a court or a tribunal is a purely private activity,and the related idea that such claims provide no broader social benefit, are demonstrablyuntenable.”The profound lesson of these and his subsequent words will of course be lost upon those who believethat “There is no such thing as society”. An impoverished belief system, which reduces most aspects ofhuman life to the fiction of a “free dealing” between two equally informed and empowered individuals,is unlikely to contribute anything to the problems of oppression facing the world in the 21st century.94Hayek, TCOL, p.136 and 143–4: and see the discussion of unlawful “economic coercion” at p.15 of David Miller, editor, in the introduction toLiberty, (OUP, 1991). J. S. Mill saw improper “coercion” as not just emanating from the state: but, for example, from aspects of the then institutionof marriage. He also saw child labour as “coercion” under the guise of “‘freedom of contract”: On Liberty, Bk. V, Ch. XI.556 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsPoint of ViewDivorce Reform in England and Wales: TheHuman Rights PerspectiveLiz Trinder*Professor of Socio-Legal Studies, University of ExeterBehaviour; Civil partnerships; Discrimination; Divorce; Human rights; Irretrievable breakdownIt is rare these days to have some unreservedly good human rights news from the UK. The recentannouncement of a Government consultation on proposals to reform the grounds for divorce in Englandand Wales1 is hugely welcome from a human rights perspective.The consultation, announced in September 2018, proposes to retain the sole ground for divorce (andcivil partnership dissolution) of irretrievable breakdown. However, breakdown would be established bya simple notification procedure taking about six months whether for sole or joint applications. Thatnotification process would replace the current requirement where breakdown must be evidenced by oneof five “facts”, namely adultery, (unreasonable) behaviour, desertion, two years’ separation with consentor five years’ separation.2 It is also proposed that the ability to defend (or prevent) the divorce or dissolutionis removed. Decisions about children and finances would continue to be entirely separate matters.The proposals are not necessarily the most radical or liberal proposals in Europe (or the US), but theydo represent a very significant change to a divorce law dating back to the late 1960s. More importantly,they offer an effective solution to a number of human rights problems with the current law.For decades, parties who wish to avoid having to wait out a two or five-year separation period haverelied on the adultery or behaviour facts to secure a divorce within a few months. That tactical use of faulthas meant that about 60% of divorces in England and Wales are based on adultery or behaviour, about 10times the proportion as in neighbouring Scotland or France where separation periods are much shorter.To make the system work, and to reduce the potential conflict generated by allegations of fault, lawyersadvise their clients to make allegations of behaviour as mild as possible. In turn, the courts “pretend” toinquire, but in any case, can only take allegations of fault at face value. The courts process about 100,000divorces and dissolutions each year on that basis, with very few cases failing to meet a very low threshold.As the most senior family judge in England and Wales put it, the law and procedures are based on“hypocrisy and lack of intellectual honesty”.3So what are the human rights problems? The first is that the gap between the law in theory and the lawin practice offends Lord Bingham’s first principle of the rule of law that the law must be intelligible, clearand predictable.4 What is particularly offensive from a human rights perspective is that only legal insidersknow how the law actually works in practice. Thus, full access to the legal remedies actually availablerequires access to legal advice, which is determined primarily by economic status. Those who can affordlegal advice will be let into the secret of how the system works in practice—that anyone can secure aquick divorce based on the behaviour fact, regardless of the happiness of the marriage. In contrast, those* , University of Exeter.1Ministry of Justice, “Reducing family conflict: reform of the legal requirements for divorce”https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/reform-of-the-legal-requirements-for-divorce/ [Accessed 10 November 2018].2Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 s.1.3Owens v Owens [2017] EWCA Civ 182 at [94].4Lord Bingham, “Rule of Law” (2007) 66 C.L.J. 67, 69–70.557[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorswho cannot afford to hire a lawyer can and do assume that their only option is to wait for two or five years,if they cannot show evidence of, say, domestic abuse or alcohol addiction. Alternatively, some partiesmay be forced to use the fault-based facts of adultery or behaviour simply because they cannot afford tomaintain two separate households for years. The differential access to faster or slower, or blame andnon-blame, remedies is deeply troubling given the legal and emotional significance of the change of statusconferred by a decree of divorce or civil partnership dissolution.A more recent problem with differential, and overtly discriminatory, access to the five facts occurredwith the introduction of civil partnership in 2004 and same-sex marriage in 2013. Rather than take theopportunity at that point to rethink how irretrievable breakdown would be established, parliament simplyreplicated the existing legal structures, but with one crucial difference. Parliament’s squeamishness aboutdefining gay sex means that the adultery fact can only be used by same-sex spouses if the respondent’s“conduct” is with an opposite-sex partner. Adultery cannot be used as a fact at all for civil partnershipdissolution. In other words, only heterosexual sex can be “adultery” and only in the context of marriage.In practical terms, this unequal treatment may make little difference to outcomes, as petitioners can usethe behaviour fact where a partner has been unfaithful. In human rights terms, however, it is a clear exampleof discrimination, contrary to art.14 of the ECHR.The human rights problems do not end there. It could be argued that producing a long list ofmisdemeanours raises privacy issues, in breach of the art.8 ECHR rights of the respondent and any children.That argument may be strengthened in the many cases where the drafting of the petition has not been acollaborative process and where the respondent may disagree with what has been included but nonethelessenters the public domain.That takes us on to possible violations of art.6 of the ECHR and the fair determination of civil rights.As noted inOwens, and as established by research,5 unless the respondent formally defends any allegationsmade in a behaviour petition, the court will take the petitioner’s account as true, however much therespondent may protest. Yet, defence is not an accessible or effective remedy. Defending the divorce isprohibitively expensive, legally challenging and unlikely to work, even after the Owens case. There areonly a dozen or so defences each year, with family lawyers otherwise encouraging respondent clients to“suck it up” and viewing the process as “a means to an end”.So why is the Government addressing divorce reform now? It does seem that the stars are aligning fordivorce reform in an otherwise unhappy political context. Family lawyers and the senior judiciary havebeen calling for reform for years. Then in 2017 things came to a head with the first major research for 20years,6 a Private Member’s Bill introduced by a former President of the Family Division,7 a campaign forreform led by The Times newspaper and, perhaps most importantly of all, a very rare defended divorcecase that reached the Supreme Court. TheOwens case involved a highly unusual combination of a husbandunwilling to accept the divorce and a trial judge unwilling to find enough evidence of “behaviour” in thepetition. The result was that the wife’s petition was refused even though the trial judge found that themarriage had broken down irretrievably. The decision was upheld (reluctantly) by the Court of Appealand Supreme Court with both courts suggesting that Parliament look at the issue.8 The case attracted ahuge public outcry, focusing on the plight of Mrs Owens trapped in a dead marriage and with no legalremedy other than a five-year wait.5Liz Trinder, Debbie Braybrook, Caroline Bryson, Lester Coleman, Catherine Houlston andMark Sefton, Finding Fault?

Whilsta major focus of the Government’s consultation document is on the negative impact of fault allegationson children, there is also a strong recognition of the increasing importance of autonomy within familylaw. Thus “The Government strongly supports marriage as a legal union that is freely entered into. Wetherefore believe that the law should respect people’s autonomy in decision-making at the end of a marriageas much as at its beginning”.9 It is not, therefore, appropriate to require people to justify their decision todivorce to the court by reference to the five facts or to provide evidence of breakdown beyond a simplenotification. And if one party has withdrawn their consent, the marriage is over.The consultation closes on 10 December 2018.10 A Bill could be expected in Autumn 2019.

The authors also analyse the potential ofsuch cross-fertilisation for the development—or regress—of international human rights. In particular,the authors point out that the interplay between the two courts would lead to continued leverage of theLuxembourg Court and EU law on British human rights practices through the binding force of the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights and the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. Meanwhile,the authors also highlight the importance of protecting the Strasbourg Court from attacks on its legitimacyand desirability that fuelled the momentum for Brexit and the challenge to the European Court of Justice’sjurisdiction over the United Kingdom.1. Introduction: is Brexit a crisis for human rights?In July 2018, the British Prime Minister Theresa May reassured the EU that the UK will not withdrawfrom the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR or the Convention).2 After her advocacy forBritain to leave the Convention entirely, regardless of the outcome of the Brexit vote,3 the PrimeMinister’spledge was very welcome. Her shift in attitude was in large part thanks to pressure from Brussels, which1This text is based on the speech delivered by Professor Pinto de Albuquerque at the annual meeting of the European Society of International Law,at the University of Manchester, on 15 September 2018.

A potentialBritish exit from the EU does pose a real threat to human rights: the Withdrawal Act would dilute EUlegal standards in important areas such as personal privacy, data protection, workers’ rights andnon-discrimination, allowing them to be amended or reversed by domestic legislation. Moreover, if exitday were to come, the EU Charter would technically lose its status as binding domestic law as the Britishcourts would no longer be obligated to follow the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union(CJEU).Contrary to the belief of some optimists,6 common law is not a satisfactory alternative. For one, commonlaw is underdeveloped in emerging areas of law like data protection and environmental conservation.Furthermore, especially in the context of the growing popularity of the low-regulation economic model,the undoing of pro-labour and equality-enforcing human rights norms appears likely.7 In addition, therights and freedoms guaranteed in the EUCharter of Fundamental Rights (CFR) would lose their supremacyand be at the mercy of a politically charged Parliament. Worse still, the UK government may now be freeto amend or repeal legislation with little parliamentary scrutiny, thereby diminishing the accountabilityof the executive branch.Meanwhile, Britain’s renewed endorsement of the Convention does not mitigate the serious risk tohuman rights in the UK and beyond.8 A relatively undiscussed aspect in this analysis is the phenomenonof cross-fertilisation between the CJEU and the Strasbourg Court, which means that Britain’s disavowalof the former may have reverberating consequences for the latter.More specifically, the backlash directed at the CJEU that partly motivated the Brexit referendum needsvery little justification to transfer to the European Court of Human Rights.9 After all, every EU MemberState must abide by the requirements of the protection of fundamental rights, which both Courts enforcethrough their respective mechanisms. Indeed, the European Court of Human Rights has not been a popularinstitution with the British in recent years. The public outrage at Hirst v United Kingdom10—although theUK government eventually reached a contestable compromise with the Committee of Ministers11—wasan early warning that the European Court of Human Rights could very well be the next target of an affront.In the debates leading up to the Brexit referendum, two strands of criticism had been prominent in theEuropean political Zeitgeist.

For them, universal human rights isa foreign concept, imposed by alien judges who lack sensitivity to domestic traditions.12On the other hand,cynics claimed that the European courts’ application of human rights law exceeded their authority, venturinginto the realm of politics. Related to this line of contention are the accusations of judicial activism andmission creep, which allegedly take place in a non-transparent development of the case-law.13Unfortunately, both of these voices became part of the widespread discourse which has hijacked themedia with alarmist cries that the government is losing control over its borders, and that Europe may berisking its cultural identity. The misleading image of Europe under constant siege from internationalorganisations became powerful as a populist battle-cry. In other words, the scepticism at international lawwas not directed solely at Luxembourg, but applied seamlessly to hostility at the Strasbourg Court aswell.14This danger is sobering, and raises questions about the sustainability of the relationship between theEuropean Court of Human Rights and the UK. At present, s.2 of the UK Human Rights Act15 survives,and the European Court of Human Rights case-law will remain as a decisive criterion in adjudicatinghuman rights cases.16 This means that the rights and principles of EU law insofar as they have beenincorporated in the Strasbourg case-law will remain binding for the UK; failure to comply with them maygive rise to a right of action. Hence, the European Court of Human Rights could continue to be a thornfor some, who may renew a campaign to target the Convention and the Court. In the face of these possibleattacks, the Court would be faced with a choice: to appease the critical voices by issuing more favourablerulings through its margin of appreciation doctrine, or firmly stand its ground to hold the state accountableeven after its departure from the EU.2. Cross-fertilisation between the CJEU and the European Court of Human RightsIn principle, the CJEU and the European Court of Human Rights are separate bodies with no binding forceon each other. The autonomy of each court is not an accident: art.52(3) of the CFR, setting out therelationship between the two courts, consciously prevented the European Court of Justice (ECJ) frombeing subordinate to the Strasbourg Court.17 While art.52(3) also states that the Charter rights equivalentto those in the ECHR are alike in scope and meaning, there is no other codification of the legal authorityof European Court of Human Rights judgments. Nonetheless, respect for the Strasbourg Court’sinterpretation of overlapping rights is especially strong for “rights on the integrity of the person, theprohibition of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, slavery and forced labor”.18 As12 Judge Pinto highlighted this contention in a recent article.

Section 3(1) provides that “[s]o far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation mustbe read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights”.16On the legal force of the Strasbourg judgments in the UK legal order, see Judge Pinto de Albuquerque’s dissenting opinion inHutchinson v UnitedKingdom [GC] (App. No.57592/08), judgment of 17 January 2017.17The relevant section reads: “In so far as this Charter contains rights which correspond to rights guaranteed by the Convention for the Protectionof Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the meaning and scope of those rights shall be the same as those laid down by the said Convention. Thisprovision shall not prevent Union law providing more extensive protection”, EU Charter of Fundamental Rights art.52(3).18D.

The EU itself is not a party to the Convention, and apparently cannot become a party withoutamendment of the Treaty on the European Union. The CJEU made this point in Opinion 2/13, in whichit held that the EU’s accession to the ECHR would be incompatible with existing treaties.20A revealing example of such cautious attitude is Elgafaji, 21 in which the ECJ discussed the authorityof the European Court of Human Rights’ interpretation of art.3. Although the ECJ admitted that EuropeanCourt of Human Rights decisions “form[ed] part of the general principles of Community law… and whilethe case-law of the [European Court of Human Rights] is taken into consideration in interpreting the scopeof that right in the Community legal order”,22 it nonetheless refused to accept the Strasbourg jurisprudenceas conclusive in adjudicating art.15(c) of the CFR.The merely “persuasive” nature of the European Court of Human Rights’ case-law was also delineatedby Advocate-General Darmon, who stated:“…most importantly, I must not fail to remind the Court that, according to its case law, the existencein Community law of fundamental rights drawn from the European Convention on Human Rightsdoes not derive from the wholly straightforward application of that instrument. This Court maytherefore adopt, with respect to provisions of the Convention, an interpretationwhich does not coincideexactly with that given by the Strasbourg authorities, in particular the European Court of HumanRights. It is not bound, in so far as it does not have systemically to take into account, as regardsfundamental rights under Community law, the interpretation of the Convention given by the Strasbourgauthorities.”23Nevertheless, the jurisprudential dialogue between the two courts is unmistakable. As this section willdemonstrate, there are countless examples of the European Court of Human Rights informing the CJEU’sinterpretation of the general principles of EU law. In fact, we use the term “cross-fertilisation”24 preciselybecause the two courts influence each other even where there is no jurisdictional overlap, or legal necessityto rely on each other. While the exact limits of European Court of Human Rights’ status as persuasiveauthority are not clear, Strasbourg judgments are frequently invoked by the ECJ. This exchange is partlyowed to the constitutional traditions common to the EU Member States, who have incorporated theConvention into their domestic legal systems.25Consequently, the Luxembourg Court refers to the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights on a “considerable variety of issues”.26 Direct citations to Strasbourg case-lawhave been increasingly frequent,27 an “important development from the earlier conduct of the ECJ, inwhich it would look at the text of the ECHR but make little reference to the European Court of HumanRights’ case[-law]”.2819G. de Burca, “The Road Not Taken: The European Union as a Global Human Rights Actor” (2011) 105 American Journal of International Law649, 679.20Opinion 2/13 of the European Court of Justice (Full Court), 18 December 2014.21Meki Elgafaji and Noor Elgafaji v Staatssecretaris van Justitie (C-465/07) [2009] E.C.R.

Such overlap could besummarised as follows: “[f]undamental rights, as guaranteed by the ECHR and as they result from theconstitutional traditions common to the Member States, shall constitute general principles of the Union’slaw”.29 Moreover, the ECJ has generally been a principled protector of rights and freedoms in Europe,making it aligned with the Strasbourg Court in its vision and values. As Philip Aston said, the ECJ “deservesimmense credit for pioneering the protection of fundamental human rights within the legal order of theCommunity when the Treaties themselves were silent on this matter”.30Thus, without citing the European Court of Human Rights as a conclusive judicial authority, the ECJhas ruled in striking likeness with Strasbourg when faced with parallel cases. One example isNS v Secretaryof State for the Home Department, which addressed the expulsion of non-EU national asylum seekersunder the Dublin II Regulation.31 Here, the ECJ held that the Member States may not transfer an asylumseeker to the “Member State responsible” where there are systemic deficiencies in the asylum applicationprocedure, and grounds for believing that the asylum seeker would face a real risk of inhuman or degradingtreatment due to conditions of reception.32 Earlier that year, the European Court of Human Rights hadreached a similar decision in MSS v Belgium and Greece, in which the Court found Greece and Belgiumto have violated the Convention through its treatment of an Afghan asylum seeker; Greece had seriousdeficiencies in the asylum procedure that put the applicant at risk of expulsion without proper examinationof merits, and Belgium knowingly exposed him to sub-standard detention and living conditions.33 Thus,the CJEU adopted the European Court of Human Rights’ reasoning in holding that states are responsiblefor knowingly exposing the applicant to danger. For critics, this invoked the argument that by “endorsingthe [European Court of Human Rights’] analysis, the ECJ profoundly unsettled the principle of mutualconfidence that underlies the CEAS common European asylum system, and by extension, the entire edificeof European integration”.34The ECJmore explicitly followed the European Court of Human Rights’ interpretation inMP v Secretaryof State for the Home Department, in which it explained that “in accordance with Article 52(3) of theCharter, in so far as the rights guaranteed by Article 4 thereof correspond to those guaranteed by Article3 of the ECHR, the meaning and scope of those rights are the same as those laid down by Article 3 of theECHR”.35 Consequently, the ECJ held that a non-EU national asylum seeker could not be expelled wherehis medical conditions would put his life at risk. Similarly, the ECJ adopted Strasbourg’s approach to therights of asylum seekers in Hirsi Jamaa, quoting the rationale of Hirsi in its own judgments of MoussaAbdida and Abdoulaye Amadou Taal.36 In sum, the substance of many CJEU decisions resembles muchof the European Court of Human Rights’ case-law.37The influence is bilateral.38 The Strasbourg Court “has been deferential to the Community in most ofits decisions”,39 respecting the CJEU’s competence to protect the rights and freedoms in Member States.For instance, in Pafitis v Greece, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in a like manner to the Court29Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe art.

Pellegrin v France is an early example of this approach.42 A more recentexample is Scoppola,43 in which the European Court of Human Rights made considerable reference to theECJ judgment of Berlusconi under a section dealing specifically with “the case-law of the court of Justiceof the European Communities”.44 In concluding that the retroactive application of the more lenient penaltywas part of the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, the Strasbourg Court quoted atlength the decision from Luxembourg.45 Another case in point is DH v Czech Republic,46 in which theEuropean Court of Human Rights cited multiple cases from the CJEU when introducing the concept ofindirect discrimination as a violation of art.41.47The borrowing of CJEU case-law has been especially noticeable in cases without precedent in Strasbourg.An early example is Marckx v Belgium.48 Faced with provisions in Belgian law that disadvantaged anunmarried mother in establishing maternity of the child, the European Court of Human Rights made abrief reference to the ECJ’s Defrenne judgment in striking down the distinction between “legitimate” and“illegitimate” families for the purpose of protecting the right to respect for family life under art.8 of theConvention.49 Likewise, several innovations in ECJ jurisprudence were cited in European Court of HumanRights’ judgments on issues involving self-incrimination, the right to a name, or the right to privacy inone’s health status.50Influence from the CJEU has not only been evident in the form of case-law, but through the moregeneral impact of EU law on the Court as well. In Karacsony, the CJEU’s interpretation of the EU Charterof Fundamental Rights served as one of the guiding comparative principles for the Strasbourg Court.51The judges were more explicit inMagyar Helsinki, dedicating a section to the CFR and two CJEU GrandChamber rulings on the protection of personal data vis-à-vis the freedom of expression and informationto support the finding of violation of art.10.52Indeed, the Strasbourg Court has adopted EU law in many consequential areas, including the mutualrecognition of judicial decisions,53 procedural rights in criminal proceedings,54 and data protection.55 Andmost importantly for the Brexit debate, EU law on asylum proceedings and family reunification has alsohad a significant effect on how the European Court of Human Rights treats relevant applications. Forexample, in JK, the Court extensively cited the Council Directive onminimum standards for the qualificationand status of third country nationals, as well as three CJEU judgments, before concluding that the non-EUnational applicants’ deportation would give rise to a violation of ECHR art.3.56 Similarly, Biao v Denmarkrelied on the European Convention on Nationality in addition to recommendations and reports from the40Pafitis v Greece (1999) 27 E.H.R.R. 566.41Douglas-Scott, “The ECJ and European Court of Human Rights after Lisbon”, in S.

In Biao, the Court also referenced atlength the CJEU’s Metock judgment for the “conditions and limits applicable to the right of residence ofspouses of EU citizen”.57Jeunesse is another recent Grand Chamber judgment on the right to familyreunification under art.8, in which the CJEU’s Gerardo Ruiz and Dereci played an influential role.58Notably, even after the “disappointment”59 of Opinion 2/13, European Court of HumanRights’ referencesto the latter’s case-law on the Charter and the CFR itself have increased.603. A double-edged sword: “virtuous” or “vicious” cycle of cross-fertilisationCommentators studying the “increasingly tight and symbiotic relationship between the European Courtof Justice and the European Court of Human Rights” have suggested that this jurisprudential dialoguemay be strategic, “with the aim of allowing each other to increase domination of public and private actorswho march into judicial arenas”.61 According to such view, judges of the two courts establish an integrativeframework in which they “increase each other’s voice and power”.62 The convergence has been interpretedby a former President of the European Court of Human Rights as a demonstration of “a clear commitmentto ensure harmony between” Luxembourg and Strasbourg.63To be clear, this is not to say that the two Courts are always in agreement with each other. The ECJhas never ruled that the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights are controlling on matters ofinterpretation of human rights. As a result, they have at times “interpreted the rights outlined in theConvention on Human Rights differently”.64However, a “virtuous cycle” of the two courts’ mutual reinforcement has been visible in some recentcases. One prominent example is the impact of the European Court of Human Rights’ Bosphorus judgmenton theKadi saga. InKadi I, the ECJ clarified the constitutional order of the EU vis-à-vis other internationalobligations of Member States, creating a benchmarking effect for the evaluation of any Community ordomestic act implementing Security Council resolutions.65Kadi I affirmed that immunity from Europeanjurisdiction would “appear unjustified, for clearly that re-examination procedure [before the SanctionsCommittee] [did] not offer the guarantees of judicial protection”.66 This was essentially an application ofthe Bosphorus test, under which the European Court of Human Rights recognises a presumption thataction taken pursuant to an international obligation complies with the ECHR if the organisation providesequivalent human rights protections; but the protection must be both substantive and procedural—thepresumption may be rebutted if that protection is deemed manifestly deficient.67 Applying the Bosphorus57Biao v Denmark [GC] (2017) 64 E.H.R.R. 1 at [59] [citingMetock v Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (C-127/08) [2008] E.C.R.I-6241].58 Jeunesse v Netherlands (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 17 at [71]–[72] [citingGerardo Ruiz Zambrano v Office national de l’emploi (C-34/09) [2011] E.C.R.I-1177 and Dereci v Bundesministerium für Inneres (C-256/11) [2011] E.C.R.

In Hoechst AG, the ECJ had refused to follow theEuropean Court of Human Rights’ innovative interpretation of art.8 in Niemietz v Germany.71 Rejectingthe Strasbourg Court’s expansive reading of the word “domicile”, the ECJ had concluded that the scopeof art.8 is concerned with personal freedoms and cannot encompass business premises.72 Later, the ECJreversed this position in Roquette Freres,73 explaining that for the purposes of determining the scope ofprivacy in relation to business practices, “regard must be had to the case-law of the European Court ofHuman Rights”.74Similarly, ECJ jurisprudence on the right against self-incrimination has been brought in line with thatof Strasbourg. In Orkem, Luxembourg had limited the scope of the right against self-incrimination onlyto criminal investigations, not to administrative procedures.75 Thirteen years later, in LVM,76 the ECJ reliedin part on “further developments in the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights” to find in favourof the applicants.77 Here, the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment in Funke—which held that theright to remain silent and against self-incrimination applies to any attempt to use pecuniary sanction—wasparticularly noted.78 Another example is the ECJ’s discussion of the European Court of Human Rights inGoodwin v United Kingdom when ruling in favour of the applicants in KB.79 Interestingly, KB addresseddiscrimination in pension eligibility, while Goodwin was primarily about a transgender woman’s accessto marriage.80 Nonetheless, Goodwin was an informative case for the ECJ in concluding that the UK haddiscriminated against the transsexual applicants in their access to pension; the judgment noted the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights’ earlier finding in a separate paragraph.81Furthermore, it is probable that the spirit of complementarity between the two courts contributed tothe gradual rise of importance of human rights in EU law.82 For one, the EU Charter itself “borrowsfundamental rights from the ECHR”.83 In 1997, the revised Treaty of the European Union (Treaty ofAmsterdam) included a new objective “to strengthen the protection of the rights and interests of the68 J.

This requirement has real teeth since states can have their membership rights suspended ifthey engage in a serious and persistent breach of human rights.However, the cautionary tale of cross-fertilisation is that it is a double-edged sword. Cross-fertilisationcan just as easily lead to a “vicious cycle” of troublesome jurisprudence multiplied through mutualencouragement. For instance, in Hans Akeberg Fransson, the Grand Chamber of the CJEU had held thatthe principle of ne bis in idem obligated states not to impose an administrative proceeding against anindividual who already faced criminal charges (Erledigungsprinzip or “exhaustion-of-procedure principle”).85Three years later, in A v Norway, the European Court of Human Rights ruled differently, holding thatduplicate proceedings are permissible if the penalties were proportionate and the proceedings werecoordinated (Anrechnungsprinzip or “accounting principle”).86A thus represented a regression of theprotection against double jeopardy. What is noteworthy is that the ECJ then followed this approach inLuca Menci, concluding that deviation from ne bis in idem is permissible if it “pursues an objective ofgeneral interest …, contains rules ensuring coordination which limits to what is strictly necessary theadditional disadvantage [for the defendant] …, [and] provides for rules making it possible to ensure thatthe severity of all of the penalties imposed is limited to what is strictly necessary”.87Applying this caution to the present situation, cross-fertilisation could either be a way to shield EUlaws on protection of fundamental freedoms from obliteration in the UK, or to diminish the impact of theECHR. On the one hand, the European Court of Human Rights has the potential to be a mechanism throughwhich the UK is still bound by the CFR and EU norms on human rights. Because Britain remains a partyto the ECHR and may not contest European Court of Human Rights’ jurisdiction, Strasbourg can continueto hold the UK accountable to the CFR indirectly where there are comparable violations under theConvention. In other words, considering that the two courts are “jointly involved into the program toaccelerate European integration and are dedicated to shaping a new European pluralism constitutionalorder”,88 the European Court of Human Rights could be an enduring leverage of the European legal system.But from a less optimistic view, the political pressure that led to a Brexit referendum could also be asource of trouble for the European Court of Human Rights. In this regard, it is not irrelevant that theStrasbourg Court has already been criticised for shying away in particularly sensitive or difficult cases.89It is unsurprising that politicians play at the very edge of respect for the Convention, or even beyond thislimit, and resist the Convention values and the Court’s judgments in polemic, if not plainly demagogic,moves to gain political support from this or that constituency. If human rights have a basic purpose, it isprecisely to be “trump cards” that protect individuals’ fundamental rights against the oppressive actionsof ill-advisedmajorities. This is particularly true in the case of easily discardedminorities, such as prisonersor migrants. Politicians who ae backed by these majorities should comply with international human rightsin general and with the Convention in particular, since every state official is bound by human rights lawand the Convention contributes to promoting a “joint European development of fundamental rights”84Treaty of Amsterdam amending the Treaty on European Union, the Treaties Establishing the European Communities and Certain Related Acts(1997) art.2.85Åklagaren v Hans Åkerberg Fransson [GC] (C-617/10) [2013] 2 C.M.L.R. 46.86A v Norway [GC] (2017) 65 E.H.R.R. 4.87 Luca Menci [GC] (C-524/15), 20 March 2018 at [65].88B.

The future of human rights in the UK and in Europe—where do we go fromhere?The preceding section has thus demonstrated that, contrary to the campaign’s promises that the UK willbe able to control immigration without accountability to EU laws and “make [their] own laws”,93parliamentary sovereignty in the UK will not be left without external checks even if Brexit is finalised.Since the UKwill still be under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, national legislationwill not be immune from challenges on the basis of incompatibility with the rights and freedoms guaranteedin the ECHR. The Human Rights Act 1998, which incorporated the Convention rights into domestic law,will also endure to keep the UK government accountable. Moreover, because of the influence of the ECJon the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence as discussed above, the UK will indirectly bebound by the general principles of European law and the CFR insofar as they have been incorporated inthe Strasbourg case-law. Admittedly, the purposive approach adopted by the CJEU in interpreting thesestandards may not be followed by the British courts after their departure from the EU is complete. However,the philosophy and decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in treating the Convention as aliving instrument will still have force, which will facilitate cross-fertilisation between the two courts.In other words, there will fortunately be no human rights “vacuum” in the UK regardless of the finaloutcome on Brexit. This means that the twomajor promises that Brexit proponents had made to the Britishpublic—parliamentary “sovereignty” and curtailing immigration94—will ring hollow. In particular, as thejudgment in Hirsi Jaama demonstrates, the European Court of Human Rights is a staunch guardian ofhuman rights for all applicants, including immigrants and refugees.95 If the xenophobic fears of asylumseekers and migrants motivated any part of the campaign, their supporters should reconsider the value ofan EU exit to their objectives.The ECHR will continue to impose standards for regulations and policies regardless of the politicalwill of the incumbent party in London. Furthermore, regardless of attacks from discontent Member Statesat times, the European Court of Human Rights will persist in “reject[ing] a self-contained … andsovereigntist convention interpretation”.96 The legal order established in Europe is “not a traditionalinternational accord of juxtaposed national egoisms”,97 leaving no part of the Member States’ legal order90The expression was coined by the German Federal Constitutional Court (BVerfG 111, 307, § 62).91The image comes from Michael Bock and Sebastian Sobota, “Sicherungsverwahrung: Das Bundesverfassungsgericht als Erfüllungsgehilfe einesgehetzten Gesetzgebers?” (2012) Neue Kriminalpolitik 106.92 See M. Amos, “The Value of the European Court of Human Rights to the United Kingdom” (2017) 28 European Journal of International Law763 (“[the Conservative Party] accused the European Court of Human Rights of ‘mission creep’ by expanding the ECHR into new areas beyond whatthe framers of the Convention had in mind and also of attempting to overrule ‘decisions of our democratically elected Parliament and overturn the UKcourts’”).93Amos, “The Value of the European Court of Human Rights to the United Kingdom” (2017) 28 European Journal of International Law 763.94See B.J.W. Eddington, “A Poorly Decided Divorce: Brexit’s Effect on the European Union and United Kingdom” (2018) 41 Suffolk TransnationalLaw Review 101, 112 (noting immigration concerns as one of the primary motivations for Brexit supporters).95 See Hirsi Jamaa [GC] (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 21.96 See Pinto de Albuquerque, “Plaidoyer for the European Court of Human Rights” [2018] E.H.R.L.R. 119, 125.97 See Pinto de Albuquerque, “Plaidoyer for the European Court of Human Rights” [2018] E.H.R.L.R. 119, 125.576 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsoutside of its jurisdictional scrutiny.98 A Member State is “responsible under Article 1 of the Conventionfor all acts and omissions of its organs regardless of whether the act or omission in question was aconsequence of domestic law or of the necessity to comply with international legal obligations”.99 In otherwords, as the Strasbourg Court has repeatedly held in its judgments, the ECHR is not and will not besubordinate to domestic rules; it will remain the supreme law of the European continent.100 This meansthat the above-explored complementarity between the Strasbourg and Luxembourg Courts, as well as theformer’s adoption of EU law, will continue to make the European legal standards relevant in the UK,regardless of its membership in the EU.5. ConclusionIn short, in the face of any Brexit-like attacks on the European human rights system, the European Courtof Human Rights will serve as a “constitutional instrument of European public order”101with a “peremptorycharacter”.102 This gives the Court an exceptionally important role to play in Europe, since leaving the EUhas proven to be a more feasible political exercise than disavowing the ECHR. In addition, the Strasbourgand the Luxembourg Courts have worked and will continue to work together “in a spirit of complementary”in the protection of human rights103 and the former will continue to be an open-minded recipient of thecase-law of the latter. Under this light, the twomain arguments to leave (regaining parliamentary sovereigntyand controlling immigration law) are nothing but false trump cards.While this article primarily discussed the potential implications for human rights in the UK if Brexitis finalised through the lens of cross-fertilisation between the CJEU and the European Court of HumanRights, the lessons or warnings from this analysis are applicable beyond a single nation. Today, Europeancountries have a clear choice: either to endorse the cosmopolitan view of universal human rights as ajustifiable and desirable limit on state sovereignty, or to embrace the parochial view of domestic legalsupremacy. The Brexit referendum is indeed a proxy fight, and could be the first of many, betweensupporters and opponents of international law and human rights. And regardless of which side wins,whether the European Court of Human Rights will continue to succeed as a final guardian of individualrights and freedoms in Europe will depend on the collective effort and commitment by the entire Europeancommunity.98 See Bosphorus [GC] (2005) 42 E.H.R.R. 1 at [153]; Nada v Switzerland [GC] (App. No.10593/08), judgment of 12 September 2012 at [168].99Anchugov v Russia (App. Nos 11157/04 and 15162/05), judgment of 4 July 2013 at [108].100 See Pinto de Albuquerque, “Plaidoyer for the European Court of Human Rights” [2018] E.H.R.L.R. 119, 125 at fn.26.101 Loizidou v Turkey (preliminary objections) [GC] (1995) 20 E.H.R.R. 99 at [75].102Bosphorus [GC] (2005) 42 E.H.R.R. 1 at [154].103Avotins (2017) 64 E.H.R.R. 2 at [116].Cross-fertilisation between the Court of Justice of the EU and European Court of Human Rights 577[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsDecision of the Russian Constitutional Court onEnforcement of the Yukos Judgment: the chasmbecoming deeperAssociate Professor Dr Azar Aliyev*Constitutionality; Enforcement; European Court of Human Rights; Just satisfaction; RussiaAbstractOn 19 January 2017, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation (hereinafter the Court) decidedthat the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the 31 July 2014 case of NeftyanayaKompaniya Yukos v Russia is non-executable.1 This decision follows more than 10 years of tensionsbetween the Russian Federation and the Council of Europe, and the European Court of Human Rights inparticular, and is certainly a milestone in Russian juridical practice regarding the jurisprudence ofinternational courts. This article is an attempt to explore the sources of the competence of the ConstitutionalCourt, to provide an overview of the key arguments of the decision, and to put the decision into historicalcontext of the relationships between the Russian Federation and the European Court of Human Rights.1. Yukos—raise and fall of a business empireYukos was one of the largest Russian oil companies in the 1990s and early 2000s. The rise of Yukos wasvery similar to most success stories in the Russian big business scene of the 1990s: very attractive stateassets were privatised under President Boris Yeltsin for a fraction of the market price in semi-legal oreven criminal ways. After the election of President Vladimir Putin, not all of these Yeltsin-era oligarchsmanaged to save their business empires. One of the classical examples was Mikhail Khodorkovsky—themain owner and top manager of Yukos.2In 2003, many legal proceedings were launched against Yukos and its affiliates in the Russian Federation,including proceedings against Khodorkovsky personally and some of his partners (e.g. Platon Lebedev).Yukos faced multiple tax claims amounting to billions of euros. As a result of the proceedings, the mostimportant assets of Yukos were seized and Yukos became insolvent. The management of the company aswell as Khodorkovsky and other stakeholders repeatedly declared that all of proceedings were orchestratedwith the sole goal of destroying the company. They filed various claims with different internationaljurisdictions trying to eliminate the results of the proceedings in the Russian Federation.2. The European Court of Human Rights judgmentThe disputes around Yukos are breaking all records of international dispute settlement history. Not onlyare the amounts awarded by the European Court of Human Rights and an investment arbitration tribunal*Associate Professor for International Economic Law and Comparative Law, Institute of Economic Law,Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg.1Decision of the Constitutional Court of Russia 1-П of 19 January 2017, http://www.ksrf.ru/en/Decision/Judgments/Documents/2017_January_19_1-P.pdf [Accessed 10 November 2018].2 See, e.g. M. Sixsmith, Putin’s Oil: The Yukos Affair and the Struggle for Russia (Continuum, 2010), pp.45 et seq.[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors578under the UNCITRAL Rules superlative (€1.86 billion and US$50 billion respectively); the impact of theproceedings on the political and legal landscape is also unprecedented.The European Court of Human Rights, in its principal judgment of 20 September 2011, held the RussianFederation liable for:(1) a violation of art.6(1) and (3)(b):the time period provided for the preparation for a case regarding the 2000–2001 taxassessment before the lower courts was too short;(2) a violation of art.1 of Protocol 1 to the ECHR:retrospective amendment of art.113 Tax Code of the Russian Federation by the interpretationof the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation3 and its application to the 2000–2001tax assessment proceedings, which resulted in the imposition and calculation of penalties;and(3) a violation of art.1 of Protocol 1 to the ECHR:disproportionate enforcement fee.4In the judgment on just satisfaction of 24 June 2014, the Chamber ruled that the Russian Federationmust pay €1,866,104,634 to the shareholders of Yukos.5Both judgments were made by a majority. Judge Bushev (ad hoc Russia) issued a dissenting opinion,Judge Hajiyev (Azerbaijan) partly joined to the dissent of Judge Bushev, and Judge Jebens (Norway) fileda concurring opinion.It is notable that after the liability proceedings in 2011, it was not Russia but Yukos that tried tochallenge the judgment before the Grand Chamber. The Russian Federation has claimed the 2011 judgmentas its victory, because the majority of claims were rejected by the Chamber.6The Russian Ministry of Justice even communicated the Action Plan on the enforcement of the 2011judgment, in which it accepted the position of the Chamber.7 However, after the Ukrainian Crisis and thefollowing decision of the arbitral tribunal in the Yukos case,8 all “western judgments” were considered“political” and the European Court of Human Rights judgment on just satisfaction, which provided forpayment of €1.9 billion, was seen as another “politicized decision from Europe”.93. Historical contextThe denial of the Constitutional Court shall be seen in the context of the debates on the European Courtof Human Rights jurisprudence that took place in Russia during the last 10–15 years. The first officiallyarticulated tensions came up with the Ilascu decision.10 The European Court of Human Rights held Russia3Decision of the Russian Constitutional Court 9-П 14 July 2005, http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_54516/ [Accessed 10 November2018].4OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v Russia (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 19.5OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v Russia (2014) 59 E.H.R.R.

TheCourt stated that Transnistria was established with substantive support of the Russian Federation and wasunder the effective authority, or at least decisive influence, of the Russian Federation. The State Duma(lower house of the Russian Parliament)11 and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov,12 qualifiedthe judgment as a political but not a legal one. Although the Russian Federation has paid the awarded justsatisfaction of €180,000, the government refused to release Ilascu, alleging that Russia does not havesovereignty over the territory of Transnistria.The adoption of the Protocol 14 to the ECHR was the second conflict between the Russian Federationand the European Court of Human Rights. The consultations took years and were vividly discussed in theRussian mass media.13However, it was in the Markin case that the Russian Federation, for the first time, elaborated on theimpossibility of enforcement of the European Court of Human Rights’ judgments.14 Markin served as anofficer of the Russian Army and after a divorce he took care of his three children alone. He applied forparental leave until his youngest child was three years old. This kind of parental leave is provided by lawfor the servicewomen of the Russian Military, but not for men. The Constitutional Court of the RussianFederation decided that such differentiation is justified based on two arguments: First, unlike women,men serve on the frontline, and as such, the possibility of leave for the servicemen would undermine themilitary readiness of the Russian Army; and second, traditionally women take care of children.Both arguments were presented by the Russian Federation in the proceedings before European Courtof Human Rights and rejected by the Chamber. The judgment in favour of Markin triggered a high leveldiscussion on the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and sovereignty of the RussianFederation. The Chairman of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, Valeriy Zorkin, publishedan article “The Limit of Pliability” in the official newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta.15 In his contribution,Judge Zorkin broadly discusses the general differences between the European societies and concludesthat national courts should have a possibility to decide in the last instance. With regard to theMarkin case,Zorkin stipulates that such a judgment contradicts the basis of the constitutional system of the RussianFederation, and therefore, cannot be accepted. Only a few days after the article was published, PresidentMedvedev held a meeting with the Judges of the Constitutional Court in which he emphasised that theRussian Federation has never transferred its sovereign right to amend its legislation to any internationalcourt.It is notable that Judge Zorkin refers in the mentioned article, as well as in his later public presentations,to the Görgülü decision of the German Constitutional Court,16 which provides for primacy of the GermanBasic Law. However, Judge Zorkin neither mentioned the fact that the German Constitutional Court infact set aside the decision of the Oberlandesgericht Naumburg to deny the execution of the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights’ judgment, nor the severe criticism in academic papers on the rather weak11 “State Duma does not recognize European court of human rights’ ruling on Ilashku case” (10 July 2004), Sputniknews.com, https://sputniknews.com/onlinenews/2004071039764812/ [Accessed 10 November 2018].12 “Sergey Lavrov: Judgment in Ilascu case is not a legal, but a political one” [Sergej Lavrov: Reshenie suda po “delu Ilashku”—ne pravovoe, apoliticheskoe] (22 May 2006), Newdaynews.ru, https://newdaynews.ru/pmr/68018.html [Accessed 10 November 2018].13See, e.g. A.

In 2011, a Draft Law initiated in the State Duma (Lower House of the Russian Parliament)provided for a new competence of the Constitutional Court to block the judgments of interstate bodies forthe protection of human rights and freedoms, including those of the European Court of Human Rights.The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lavrov, and President Putin on many occasions named some EuropeanCourt of Human Rights’ judgments political, and even invoked the possibility of withdrawing Russia fromthe jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.18The European Court of Human Rights’ judgment awarding €1.8 billion to the Yukos shareholders wasthe last straw.The judgment became final on 15 December 2014. Just a few days before the 15 June 2015 deadlinefor the submission of the comprehensive plan, on 11 June 2015, 93 deputies from all factions of the StateDuma requested the Constitutional Court to clarify the constitutionality of the provisions of the Law onAccession of the Russian Federation to the ECHR,19 requiring that the European Court of Human Rights’judgments should be respected in the territory of the Russian Federation even if they contradict theConstitution of the Russian Federation. The Ministry of Justice informed the European Court of HumanRights that it would suspend execution of the Yukos judgment due to the pending case before the RussianConstitutional Court. Notably, the Constitutional Court referred in the decision,20 not to the Yukos case,but to the Anchugov judgment of the European Court of Human Rights,21 which obliged the RussianFederation to remove the blanket ban on voting imposed on prisoners. The ban is provided in art.32(3) ofthe Russian Constitution,22 and therefore the Anchugov judgment revealed a more obvious contradictionbetween the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence and the Russian Constitution than the Yukoscase. Furthermore, the Anchugov case touches upon the similar problems as the Hirst v United Kingdom(No.2) judgment.23 The Court directly refers to this case alongside theMaggio24 and Görgülü cases.25 TheConstitutional Court decided that the Law on Accession of the Russian Federation to the ECHR wasconstitutional, and the courts of the Russian Federation must interpret the Constitution in aConvention-friendly manner. However, the Court stated that a judgment of the European Court of HumanRights can only be executed if it is in line with the Constitution of the Russian Federation.The decision of the Constitutional Court was published on 14 July 2015. Shortly thereafter, on 18November 2015, a Draft Law providing for the new competence of the Constitutional Court to declarethe impossibility of execution of the European Court of Human Rights’ judgments in the territory of the17Ch.

In a record-breaking three weeks, the Draft Law passedthree readings in the State Duma, including consultations in the Law Commission and the Council ofFederation (higher House of the Russian Parliament). It was signed by President Putin on 14 Decemberand entered into force on the same date with publication on the online Legal Portal of the RussianFederation.26 The direct link between the speedy proceedings and Yukos judgment was vividly discussedin the Russian media.27Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court used this new competence for the first time in the aforementionedAnchugov case, deciding that the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment contradicts the Constitutionand therefore cannot be executed by the authorities of the Russian Federation. The decision on theimpossibility of enforcement of the Yukos judgment followed only a month later.4. Decision of the Russian Constitutional Court on the Yukos judgmentThe Constitutional Court launched proceedings upon the request of the Ministry of Justice of the RussianFederation. The Ministry of Justice requested that the following be rejected:• the execution of the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment regarding compensationfor pecuniary damage caused by the retroactive application to the applicant company ofart.113 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation on a three-year limitation period for taxoffences;• the execution of the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment regarding the amount ofthe enforcement fee, which constituted 7% of the entire amount of its debts in payment oftaxes, fines and penalties; and• the execution of the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment regarding the payment of€300,000 compensation for costs and expenses of the proceedings.28The Court refused to review the third request, stating that the compensation of costs and expenses wasoutside of its competence; it could not decide on the possibility of enforcement of decisions of internationalcourts in human rights issues provided in arts 3(1) and 104(1)–(3) of the Federal Constitutional Law “OnConstitutional Court of the Russian Federation”.29a. General elaborationsThe Court launched its elaborations with a very general discussion on the relationship of the EuropeanCourt of Human Rights judgments and the Russian Constitution. It referred to earlier judgments, repeatedlystating that under art.15(4) of the Russian Constitution the ECHR, as every other international treaty ofthe Russian Federation, is an integral part of Russia’s legal system and therefore the Russian Federationis obliged to execute European Court of Human Rights’ judgments. The Court underlines that it acceptsthe European Court of Human Rights’ judgments, respects the ECHR as a living instrument for theprotection of human rights, and accepts that the European Court of Human Rights’ case-law can changethe interpretation of the Treaty. Notably, the Court sees an example of such an acceptance and respect in26 Federal Constitutional Law of Russia 7 of 14 December 2015 “On Amendments to the Federal Constitutional Law ‘On Constitutional Court ofthe Russian Federation’” [Federal’nyj konstitucionnyj zakon№ 7-FKZ “O vnesenii izmenenij v Federal’nyj konstitucionnyj zakon ‘OKonstitucionnomSude Rossijskoj Federacii’”], http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001201512150010 [Accessed 10 November 2018].27See, e.g. “State Duma permitted Russia not to comply with the international courts’ judgments” [Gosduma razreshila Rossii ne ispolnjat’ reshenijamezhdunarodnyh sudov] (4 December 2015), Vestnikcivitas.ru, http://vestnikcivitas.ru/news/3901 [Accessed 10 November 2018].28Decision of the Constitutional Court of Russia No.1-П of 19 January 2017, http://doc.ksrf.ru/decision/KSRFDecision258613.pdf [Accessed 10November 2018].29 Federal Constitutional Law of Russia 1 of 21 July 1994 “On Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation” (last revision 28 December 2016)[Federal’nyj konstitucionnyj zakon No.1-FKZ “O Konstitucionnom Sude Rossijskoj Federacii”], http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_4172/ [Accessed 10 November 2018].582 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsits own unsuccessful attempts to identify a possibility to execute the Anchugov judgment in line with theConstitution.Nevertheless, the Court emphasises the priority of the Russian Constitution over the ECHR. Thisstatement is supported by references to arts 26, 31(1) and 46(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law ofTreaties (VCLT).30 In the Court’s understanding, the above-mentioned provisions leave room fornon-execution of European Court of Human Rights’ judgments when the European Court of HumanRights’ judges deviate from the ordinary meanings to be given to the terms of the ECHR or the judgment“attributedmeaning diverging from generally binding provisions of international public order (jus cogens)”,the object and purpose of the ECHR as a whole and the national legal order: “A State in whose respectthe judgment in this case has been delivered is entitled to refuse to execute it as going beyond theobligations, voluntarily taken upon itself when ratifying the Convention”. The general reference of theCourt to the above-mentioned provisions of the VCLT is very difficult to follow.31 In particular, art.46(1)of the VCLT is devoted to the issues of ultra vires conduct of state authorities concluding an internationaltreaty. The decision contains no indication as to how this provision could be applicable to the issue inquestion. Additionally, the Court’s other arguments are very diffuse. In one passage the Court refers tothe objectives of the ECHR and the national legal order cumulatively; in another one to the jus cogensand the national legal order. Finally, it refers to the national legal order only without explanation whyanother two criteria were skipped. However, none of the named articles of the VCLT refers to nationallaws or constitutions.It is not clear why the Constitutional Court makes no distinction between its right to deny the executionof a European Court of Human Rights’ judgment under Public International Law (including the VCLT)and under the Russian Constitution. Legal argumentation of the Russian Constitutional Court has alreadybeen critically scrutinised,32 and the discussed decision provides interesting material for further analysis.The Court concludes that, in exceptional cases, it cannot support the European Court of Human Rights’interpretation of the ECHR, if this interpretation contradicts the provisions of the Russian Constitutionpertaining to human and civil rights and freedoms, as well as to the basis of Russia’s constitutional system.In Part 3 of the decision, the Court gives a very general overview of the correlation between the rightof ownership and freedom of entrepreneurial and other economic activity, and the obligation to pay legallyestablished taxes and levies, with an obvious conclusion that the limitation of this right is in line with theConstitution, provided that such limitation is necessary and proportionate.b. Retroactive application of art.113 of the Tax CodePart 3 is an introduction to the elaborations of the Court on whether the European Court of Human Rights’judgment on just satisfaction for exaction of penalties against Yukos for the years 2000 and 2001 isexecutable.The European Court of Human Rights decided by a majority of four votes to three that the imposedtax penalty violated art.1 Protocol 1 to the ECHR. The Chamber found that the Constitutional Courtchanged the legislation by re-defining the three-year limitation period provided in art.113 of the Tax Codeby deciding not to apply it, if a taxpayer opposed tax control and tax checkup, or an act of a tax checkupwas registered.3330Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 23 May 1969, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol.1155, p.331.31About the Court’s own approach to jus cogens see I.

Engel, 2009), pp.43 et seq.33Decision of the Russian Constitutional Court 9-П of 14 July 2005, http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_54516/ [Accessed 10November 2018].Russia’s Enforcement of the Yukos Judgment 583[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe Court disagreed with the Chamber and stated that its 2005 decision involved the only possibleinterpretation of the limitation period provision of art.113 of the Tax Code in accordance with the RussianConstitution: “Any other, unconstitutional, interpretation of its provisions … based on the exclusivelyformal understanding of the norm” would violate the principle of equal treatment and proportionalityprovided in arts 17(3),.19(1) and (2) as well as 55(3) of Constitution. The Constitutional Court strived “tosecure their reasonable and fair application” of these rules to conscientious taxpayers. At the same time,the Court stressed that a professional participant of entrepreneurial activity could not rely on any otherinterpretation of art.113 of the Tax Code that would favour a fraudulent taxpayer.The Constitutional Court briefly clarified that it was not art.57 of the Russian Constitution which wasreferred to by the European Court of Human Rights,34 but art.54 of the Constitution that should be applied.Article 54 states:“1. A law introducing or aggravating responsibility shall not have retrospective effect.2. No one may bear responsibility for the action which was not regarded as a crime when itwas committed. If after violating law the responsibility for that is eliminated or mitigated,a new law shall be applied.”By contrast, art.57 states:“Everyone shall be obliged to pay the legally established taxes and dues. Laws introducing new taxesor deteriorating the position of taxpayers may not have retroactive effect.”Article 57 prohibits only retrospective application of laws that change the property status of a taxpayerand directly influence the order of his fulfilment of the tax duty. The 2005 decision dealt only with thetime limitation of responsibility already provided in art.113 of the Tax Code and did not introduce a newsanction for the hindrance to a tax checkup. In the discussed case, OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukoswas already aware of the tax authority’s position, because an order was issued within the three-yearlimitation period. Therefore, in the Court’s view, only art.54 of the Constitution, which provides a generalprohibition to aggravate the responsibility retrospectively, should apply.The Court concludes by stating that the decision of the Constitutional Court of 2005 has not changedthe decisions of other courts regarding Yukos, and therefore, there was no violation of the legal predictabilityguarantee, without any further discussion of the Chamber’s position.Interpretation of law in historical contextThe Court also argued that the specific historical context of the development of tax regulation should betaken into account by evaluation of its 2005 decision on art.113 of the Tax Code. In the Court’s view, theRussian Federation received an opportunity to launch meaningful tax reforms only in the 2000s, after adecade of political and economic instability. At that time, it was important to take all possible measuresto improve the tax system of the Russian Federation. In the Court’s view, even the retrospective changeof the settled jurisprudence was admissible under the specific historical circumstances. The Court especiallyemphasises that the interpretation of art.113 of the Tax Code provided in the 2005 decision was the onlypossible one; any other interpretation would have been “comfortable for realization of unlawful goals anddiverging from its constitutional meaning”. The Court stresses that a big company such as Yukos, whichhad employed many high-profile lawyers, “could and had to” expect that the settled jurisprudence onart.113 of the Tax Code would be changed and reinterpreted in the constitutionally only possible way thatthe Constitutional Court did in its 2005 decision.34OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v Russia (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 19 at [307].584 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe Court’s approach to use “the historical context” as an excuse for a retrospective change of thesettled jurisprudence triggered a wave of criticism in the legal blogs.35 Many legal professionals saw highrisks for the rule of law and legal predictability if the courts could retrospectively change their jurisprudencedue to “changes of historical dimension”. Indeed, the criteria of “historical context” is anything but clearand concerns of the legal community are plausible. Notably, the concept of “historical context” was notreferred to in the jurisprudence after.Law-ruining effectAnother very broad and highly controversial concept developed by the Court in the decision is the conceptof the “law-ruining effect”.36The Court stresses that the “malicious” unprecedented tax-evasionmechanismsdeveloped by Yukos caused billions in losses for the state budget and had a “law-ruining effect, hinderingstabilization of constitutional-law regime and public legal order”, which could not be disregarded. Anypayment of compensation would promote the erosion of the public legal order. However, the Court doesnot clarify the notion of the term “law-ruining effect”. It remains to be seen, whether and how this conceptwill be developed in the future.Substance of Yukos activities and the role of the shareholdersThe Court also introduces the concept of “unjust substance of activities”, which is derived from the conceptof the “law-ruining effect”. The Court states that the very substance of Yukos and its shareholders’ activitieswas so unjust that the payment of the awarded satisfaction would contradict the principles of equality andjustice provided in the Constitution. In particular, the payment of compensation to the former shareholdersof Yukos, their heirs, and legal successors, would violate these principles. The Court admits that not allshareholders were involved in the illegal activities, but stipulates that their losses were a result of thefailure to exercise corporate rights “reasonably and conscientiously in their own interests and in the interestsof the legal person” and to impose control over the management.The argumentation of the Court has far-reaching implications for subsequent case-law. The Courtdeclares that shareholders of a public stock company can be held liable (or at least lose some of their rightsto compensation) for activities of the company’s management if the “substance of the company’s activitieswas unjust”. Based on the aforementioned arguments, the Court concludes that the execution of theEuropean Court of Human Rights’ judgment on payment of just satisfaction for the tax penalties wouldcontradict the Constitution of the Russian Federation and is therefore impossible.The Court did not even analyse whether the shareholders participated in Yukos’ fraudulent activity.Such reasoning does not establish a rebuttable presumption, but rather, an automatic liability of shareholders.At least in the present case, shareholders were not given a chance to present their position effectively andmake use of their right to effective judicial protection.c. Disproportional enforcement feeThe Court continues with an examination of the possibility to execute the European Court of HumanRights’ judgment on just satisfaction of €566,780,436 for a disproportionately high enforcement fee.The judgment of the Chamber in this issue was formulated quite vaguely. One looks in vain for anexplanation of why 7% of the exacted sum or value of a debtor’s property enforcement fee was35See, e.g. S. Sulakshin, “Constitutional Court against European Court” [Konstitucionnyj Sud protiv Evropejskogo Suda] (23 January 2017), https://cont.ws/@sulakshin/499607 [Accessed10 November 2018].36 Some legal bloggers have severely criticised the concept, e.g. S. Ivanov, “The doctrine of relativity in law” [Teorija otnositel’nosti v prave] (21January 2017), Zakon.ru, https://zakon.ru/blog/2017/1/21/teoriya_otnositelnosti_v_prave [Accessed 10 November 2018].Russia’s Enforcement of the Yukos Judgment 585[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsdisproportionate; there is no calculation justifying the decision to reduce the fee by almost 50%.37 TheChamber admits that the enforcement fee is an administrative penalty and is not related to the actualamount of the enforcement expenses borne by the bailiffs,38 but just a couple of lines later, the Chamberrefers to the factual expenses. The Chamber also does not explain why the enormous tax evasions at issueshould not justify the maximum fee, in particular regarding the fact that the reduction of the fee isexceptional. Nevertheless, in general, the message of the Chamber is clear: the authorities applying anymeasures shall regard their overall effect. This effect was devastating in the Yukos case.The Court starts with a brief restatement of its 2001 decision on the constitutionality of the enforcementfee. In that case, the Court decided that the enforcement fee is not a fee, but an administrative penal sanction(fine),39 which is in line with the Constitution. As an administrative penalty the enforcement fee shall beimposed in a justified and proportionate manner, and 7% “represents only the admissible maximum …the upper border” of such a penalty. In the Court’s perspective, systematic, large-scale and long-lastingoffences on the company’s part, connected with the criminal tax evasion schemes of Yukos, as well asactive hindrance to tax checkup, justified application of the highest enforcement fee rate to Yukos. TheCourt does not counter the arguments of the Chamber on the overall effect of applied measures, or a needto give Yukos a chance to survive. The Court concludes that the just satisfaction in this case also contradictsthe Constitution of the Russian Federation and therefore cannot be executed.d. Conciliatory messagesIt is quite clear that in denying the enforcement of the judgment, the Court tries not to slam the door. Indoing so, it refuses to review some issues raised by the Ministry of Justice. For example, has Yukosexhausted local remedies in regard to enforcement fee, since the appeal claimwas withdrawn?May Yukosshareholders be beneficiaries of the judgment? How should the shareholders be identified if they werenot named in the judgment? The Court stresses that this kind of review would mean an appraisal of theEuropean Court of Human Rights’ judgment in procedural matters and the Court regards it as appropriateto evade such evaluation because it is not necessary in the present case. Another conciliatory statementmade was that there would be a possibility to compensate losses of shareholders resulting from the criminalactivity of Yukos and its management if new property of the liquidated Yukos is revealed. The symboliccharacter of this statement is evident because Yukos owes billions to the Russian Federation and the Courtsets the priority for budgetary claims.5. DissentsThe decision of the Court was not unanimous. There were two dissenting opinions from Judge Yaroslavtsevand Judge Aranovskiy. Both dissents are construed as decisions on inadmissibility of the request of theMinistry of Justice. This allowed addressing all issues raised in the request, even those which were ignoredby the Court.37The answer on this question is quite prosaic: the Russian Ministry of Justice has mentioned 4% as acceptable enforcement fee during thecommunications on enforcement. OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v Russia (2014) 59 E.H.R.R. SE12 at [32].38OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v Russia (2014) 59 E.H.R.R. SE12 at [655].39 In the Court’s narrative: “it has fixed monetary expression established by law, is exacted in a compulsory way, is legally registered by a resolutionof a competent official, is levied in the event of the commission of an offence and is entered to the budget and to non-budgetary fund, the resourcesof which are State property”.586 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsa. Judge YaroslavtsevFirst of all, Judge Yaroslavtsev disagreed with the position of the Court and stated that the interpretationgiven in the decision of the Constitutional Court from 2005 on art.113 of the Tax Code was an implicitchange of law.Furthermore, he especially pointed out the very poor case management of the Ministry of Justice. TheMinistry of Justice did not appeal the Chambers 2011 judgment and even communicated an Action Planfor its enforcement.40 Judge Yaroslavtsev stresses that, in general, the judgment follows the Russian positionand the Chamber denied the vast majority of claims raised by Yukos. Even the severely criticised reductionof the enforcement fee from 7% to 4% was obviously proposed by the Russian Federation.41 Furthermore,the Russian Federation did not raise the issue of whether shareholders could be regarded as beneficiariesof the just satisfaction in the European Court of HumanRights’ proceedings. Since all provided opportunitiesto challenge the issues in the European Court of Human Rights were missed, the request should beinadmissible.In the view of Judge Yaroslavtsev, the only proper way out for Russia was to use the mechanismprovided in art.46(3) of the ECHR, that is, to request the Committee of Ministers to refer the case to theCourt for interpretation.The dissent of Judge Yaroslavtsev is written in a very enjoyable and ironic manner, and he elaborateson many points of argumentation that are missing in the majority decision. However, it is unclear whatkind of effect Judge Yaroslavtsev expects from the proceedings under art.43(3) of the ECHR, whichprovides a mere possibility to refer the judgment for interpretation. Neither the 2011 judgment on themerits nor the 2014 judgment on just satisfaction contain any prima facie ambiguities.b. Judge AranovskiyJudge Aranovskiy agreed with Judge Yaroslavtsev (using different arguments) that the request of theMinistry is inadmissible, and he also severely criticised the case management by the Ministry. However,the argumentation he offers differs substantially both from the position of the majority and from those ofJudge Yaroslavtsev. Judge Aranovskiy stipulates that the just satisfaction judgment of the Chambercontradicts the jus cogens, because the European Court of Human Rights had no competence to decide infavour of persons which were not present in the court proceedings. In general, Judge Aranovskiy followsthe position of the dissenting opinion of Judges Bushev and Hajiyev to the 2014 just satisfaction judgment.6. ConclusionIt is obvious that the situation around the Yukos case had a very strong political dimension. Two decisionsof the Russian Constitutional Court denying the enforceability of the European Court of Human Rights’judgments within a few months cannot be understood otherwise than a sign of deep crisis. A retrospectiveanalysis shows that the recent denials of execution were anything else but surprising. In past years Russiahas severely criticised the European Court of Human Rights’ jurisprudence many times and de factodisregarded its judgments (e.g. after the Lebedev judgment,42 new criminal proceedings were launchedagainst the applicant and the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment was de facto thwarted).40Action Plan on the enforcement of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in case OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v Russia(2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 19, was rectified on 17 January 2012 under r.81 of the Rules of Court, final on 8 March 2012, https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=090000168063cf2e [Accessed 10 November 2018].41The RussianMinistry of Justice admitted in the hearings that some statement was made, but it was misunderstood by the European Court of HumanRights. The full recording of the Constitutional Court hearing 15 December 2016 on the case No.1-П is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxX46p2Xuqc [Accessed 10 November 2018].42 Lebedev v Russia (2008) 47 E.H.R.R. 34.Russia’s Enforcement of the Yukos Judgment 587[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsOn the positive side, one can see attempts from the both Courts not to escalate the conflict to the pointof no return. The Constitutional Court repeatedly mentions its respect for the European Court of HumanRights’ jurisprudence and the necessity of a dialogue. As the Court puts it: “Russia is entitled as anexception to deviate from fulfilment of the obligations imposed thereon, if such deviation is the onlypossible way to avoid violation of the Constitution of the Russian Federation” (emphasis added). On theother side, the conflict between the Russian Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rightsis just part of a larger conflict between the Russian government and the European institutions, in particularwith the Council of Europe (e.g. PACE suspended the voting rights of the Russian delegation43). Thisindicates that tensions in other issues could strongly affect legal discussions. Today, almost two yearsafter the decision of the Constitutional Court the political situation is deteriorating even further. The Headsof both Chambers of the Russian Parliament publicly discuss the option to withdraw from the Council ofEurope.44The SecretaryGeneral of the Council of Europe, Thorbjorn Jagland, named the Russianwithdrawalfrom the Convention a “disaster” for Russians and “a major problem for Europe”.45The negative impact of the crisis is much deeper than non-enforcement of one or another of hundredsof European Court of Human Rights’ judgments against Russia. The Russian Federation is not the onlyContracting State of the ECHR which has denied or at least not excluded the possibility to deny theexecution of the European Court of Human Rights’ decisions.46 The main problem in the Yukos case isnot the non-execution as such, but rather formalisation of a special proceeding for denial of execution andthe political dimension of the Yukos case. Therefore, the decision of the Constitutional Court to deny theexecution of the Yukos judgment is much more problematic than for the Anchugov judgment. The latterdecision was based on very clear wording of the Russian Constitution and a denial to accept a differentinterpretation of the European Court of Human Rights and can be regarded as an integral part of theongoing legal discussions between the European Court of Human Rights and the national courts ofContracting States on the interpretation of sovereignty, which is inherent for every dualistic system.47 Onthe contrary, the Yukos decision of the Constitutional Court had a very transparent political backgroundand was coupled with a substantial economic value, which is exceptional for European Court of HumanRights’ judgments. The Court’s reasoning is based on several new and rather unclear concepts, such as“law-ruining effect” or “unjust substance of activities”. Such a utilitarian approach causes a generaldecrease of acceptance of the ECHR and the European Court of Human Rights’ jurisprudence in particular.Even if the Russian Federation will remain in the Council of Europe, references to the European Court ofHuman Rights’ jurisprudence in the national courts and even in academic papers will be less persuasive.There is a general consensus that the European Court of Human Rights’ jurisprudence gave very importantimpulses to the modernisation of the Russian legal framework in many areas. It remains hopeful thatlawyers will be able to avoid the political dimension, at least as much as possible.43See Parliamentary Assembly Resolution 1990 (2014) “Reconsideration on substantive grounds of the previously ratified credentials of the Russiandelegation”, http://website-pace.net/documents/10643/110596/20140410-Resolution1990-EN.pdf/57ba4bca-8f5f-4b0a-8258-66ca26f7117b [Accessed10 November 2018].44 “Volodin assumed that Russia can exit Council of Europe” [Volodin ne iskluchil vykhod Rossii iz Soveta Evropy] (13 October 2018), Rbc.ru,https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5bc1c4db9a79470b801d346b [Accessed 10 November 2018].45T.

The European Court of Human Rights has long played a vitalrole in ensuring that state surveillance practices are governed by law and are compatible with the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights. The Court has once more held that the UK’s surveillance practices violatearts 8 and 10 of the Convention, but it has also confirmed that states can legitimately choose to engagein mass surveillance. Moreover, its approach raises significant concerns about its long-term role asguardian of the right to privacy.IntroductionIn 2013 Edward Snowden released classifiedNSA documents exposing a vast network of global surveillanceprograms. The files suggested that the UK intelligence agencies are engaged in bulk collection of internetand international communications data and that cooperative information sharing relationships have formedbetween our agencies and other governmental intelligence agencies.1 In Big Brother Watch v UnitedKingdom the European Court of Human Rights found that some of these practices violated arts 8 and 10of the ECHR.2 This was significant but it will not lead to radical reform. Moreover, there are a number ofreasons why we should be concerned about the long-term implications for the right to privacy. First, theCourt has given states a widemargin of appreciation to determine what type of surveillance to use, includingmass surveillance.3 Second, whilst the Court seeks to ensure that states satisfy a series of minimumsafeguards it declined to expand those safeguards to respond to changes in surveillance capabilities.4 Third,whilst deference was to be expected there was a lack of engagement with the ramifications of masssurveillance for the right to privacy.5 Privacy and private life barely feature in any substantive sense andthere are scant acknowledgements of the threat that secret surveillance poses to democracy. Instead, the*University Lecturer, University of Cambridge.1The Snowden files suggest that the UK intelligence agency GCHQ uses a program named TEMPORA to intercept data flowing through underwatertransatlantic fibre optic cables landing in the UK. The British Government has consistently adopted a neither confirm, nor deny approach to thisallegation but legal proceedings have assumed that the allegations are true. The Snowden files also revealed that through a programme called PRISMthe NSA collects data from the servers of US internet companies (Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple)and through a program called UPSTREAM it collects data directly from cables and infrastructure. The US Government acknowledged the existenceof PRISM and GCHQ has since acknowledged that it acquired information from the US that had been obtained via PRISM.

The first and secondapplicants did not bring proceedings in the UK before lodging their application with the European Courtof Human Rights, whereas the third applicants had brought proceedings in the Investigatory PowersTribunal (IPT).7Proceedings before the IPTThe IPT investigates complaints of unlawful use of covert techniques by public authorities and claimsagainst the intelligence agencies.8 It is the only forum in the UK in which human rights claims can bebrought against the intelligence agencies.9 In 2014 the third applicants argued that: (i) accessing or otherwisereceiving intercepted communications and communications data from the US Government; and (ii)intercepting, inspecting and retaining communications and communications data violated arts 8, 10, and14 ECHR.10 The IPT held a public hearing, as well as a closed hearing, which enabled it to considerGCHQ’s unpublished internal arrangements.11 On 9 October 2014 the Government agreed to disclosesome of those arrangements. This material, known as the “9th October disclosure”, set out further detailsof intelligence agencies practices.In December 2014 the IPT declared that the practices did not violate the Convention.12 It also determinedthat the 9 October disclosure provided a clear and accurate summary of evidence which should be disclosedand that the rest of the closed hearing was too sensitive for disclosure.13In its second judgment in February 2015 the IPT held that prior to the 9 October disclosure intelligencesharing was not sufficiently transparent and thus violated arts 8 and 10 of the ECHR.14 This was the IPT’sfirst ever determination that the intelligence agencies had acted unlawfully. It was, however, seriouslylimited by the fact that the IPTwent on to determine that following the disclosure the regimewas transparentand now complies with the Convention.15The European Court of Human RightsIn September 2018 the European Court of Human Rights held by five votes to two that the bulk interceptionregime violated art.8 of the ECHR; by six votes to one that the regime for acquiring communications dataviolated art.8 of the ECHR; by five votes to two that the intelligence sharing regime did not violate art.8of the ECHR; and six votes to one that there had been a violation of art.10 of the ECHR in respect of bothbulk interception and acquiring communications data. The Court unanimously held that the arts 6 and 14ECHR applications were inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded.166 See discussion below at “Final Reflections—Where was the Right to Privacy?”.7 Liberty v GCHQ [2014] UKIPTrib 13_77-H (5 December 2014); [2015] UKIPTrib 13_77-H (26 February 2015).8Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 s.65.9Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 s.65(2)(a).10 Liberty [2014] UKIPTrib 13_77-H (5 December 2014 judgment).11 Liberty [2014] UKIPTrib 13_77-H (5 December 2014 judgment).12 Liberty [2014] UKIPTrib 13_77-H (5 December 2014 judgment).13 Liberty [2014] UKIPTrib 13_77-H (5 December 2014 judgment) at [11].14 Liberty [2015] UKIPTrib 13_77-H (26 February 2015 judgment) at [23].15 Liberty [2015] UKIPTrib 13_77-H (26 February 2015 judgment) at [32].16Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15).590 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsExhaustion of domestic remediesThe Court first had to consider whether the first and second applicants’ cases were inadmissible as theyhad not brought proceedings before the IPT.17 The applicants argued that they had not brought proceedingsas they had relied on the Court’s determination in Kennedy v United Kingdom that the IPT is not aneffective remedy.18 The Court revisitedKennedy and determined that the IPT jurisprudence had developedvastly since then such that its earlier concerns were no longer valid.19 It thus declared that failure to bringIPT proceedings renders applications inadmissible unless there are special circumstances. Applying thisto the facts, however, it held that there were special circumstances as the applicants had been entitled torely on Kennedy at the point at which they lodged their applications.20 Yet whilst these applicationsproceeded, in the future applicants will have to go to the IPT and the esteem that the Court expressed forthe tribunal suggests that it is likely to be deferential to its decisions.21Article 8 of the ECHRTurning to the merits, the Court considered whether art.8 of the ECHR was violated by: (i) the regime forbulk interception of communications by the UK intelligence agencies; (ii) the receipt of information viathe intelligence sharing regime; and (iii) the regime for the acquisition of communications data.(i) Regime for bulk interceptionThe applicants argued, first, that the regime governing bulk interception lacked the quality of law becauseit was so complex as to be inaccessible and vast parts of the regime were based on arrangements that werenot available to the public.22 Second, that it did not comply with the minimum safeguards identified inWeber v Germany.23 TheWeber safeguards examine the scope and application of the regime by referenceto: (i) the nature of offences; (ii) the categories of persons affected; (iii) duration; (iv) the procedure to befollowed for storing, accessing, examining and using intercepted data; (v) the procedure to be followedfor communicating intercepted data to other parties; and (vi) the circumstances in which intercept materialmust be erased or destroyed.24 The applicants’ third argument was that the Weber safeguards were nolonger sufficient and additional safeguards were needed, in particular the applicants argued for: (i) arequirement of reasonable suspicion; (ii) judicial authorisation; and (iii) a requirement that states notifysubjects after the surveillance has ended.25 Finally, the applicants argued that the regimewas disproportionateas it contravened the principles against blanket approaches established in S v United Kingdom and MK vFrance.26The Government responded by shifting the focus from legality to the critical need to combat terrorism.27As the hearing took place in November 2017 after the attack on Westminster Bridge (March 2017), theManchester Arena bombing (22 May 2017) and the attack on London Bridge (June 2017), as well asfurther terrorist attacks elsewhere in Europe, these monstrosities were at the forefront of considerations.28The Government thus argued for deference by asserting that it was “for States to judge what was necessary17Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [237]–[268].18Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [241]–[242].19Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [253].20Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [268].21Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [256]–[257].22Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [273].23Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [274]–[279].24Weber v Germany (2008) 46 E.H.R.R.

Indeed, whilst the Court purported that the margin extended only to the type of surveillance andnot its operation in practice it limited the safeguards that the Court was willing to mandate and the Court’sengagement with proportionality analysis. In fact, the Court rejected two of the three proposed minimumsafeguards on the basis that they would undermine its acceptance of bulk interception.39The third additional safeguard contemplated in Big Brother Watch was judicial authorisation.40 Therewas some hope following Zakharov v Russia41 and Szabo v Hungary42 that the Court was moving towards,if not judicial authorisation, then a more rigorous independent authorisation requirement. In Zakharov theCourt declared that “it is in principle desirable to entrust supervisory control to a judge, judicial controloffering the best guarantees of independence, impartiality and a proper procedure”,43 but that non-judicialauthorities can authorise surveillance provided that they are “sufficiently independent from the executive”.44Moreover, in Szabo the Court declared that a non-judicial body is compatible only if it is “sufficientlyindependent of the executive”, noting that “the political nature of the authorisation and supervision increasesthe risk of abusive measures”.45 The Court in Szabo went on to emphasise that the “rule of law impliesinter alia that an interference by the executive authorities with an individual’s rights should be subject toeffective control which should normally be assured by the judiciary” and that “control by an independent29Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [283].30Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [285].31Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [286]–[293].32Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [292].33Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [294].34Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [294].35Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [294].36Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [282].37Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [384]–[386].38Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [314].39Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [317].40Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [318]–[320].41 Zakharov v Russia (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 17.42 Szabo v Hungary (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 3.43 Zakharov (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 17 at [233].44 Zakharov (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 17 at [258].45 Szabo (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 3 at [77].592 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsbody, normally a judge with special expertise, should be the rule and substitute solutions the exception,warranting close scrutiny”.46 Thus the Court declared in Szabo that “supervision by a politically responsiblemember of the executive … does not provide the necessary guarantees”.47 All of this suggested that asystem of authorisation based purely on executive oversight would fall short of the requirements ofConvention. The Court’s position was, however, weaker in Big Brother Watch where it reasoned thatjudicial authorisation is not necessary,48 and that states can operate without it provided that there is anadequate system of independent oversight.49Underlying the Court’s approach was a legitimate concern that judicial oversight may not alwaysprovide an effective independent check; indeed the Court highlighted Russia, Turkey and Bulgaria asthree cases in which it had found that judicial authorisation was ineffective in preventing abuse.50 Thereis an obvious risk of stereotypes emerging regarding particular states, but in general the Court is right toquestion whether oversight truly is independent and effective. Indeed, the Court should look carefully atsubstance as opposed to form in assessing safeguards. Nevertheless, the dissenting judges were right tonote that “the fact that a given safeguard would not be sufficient is not enough to support a conclusionthat it should not be considered necessary”.51 Thus the fact that judicial authorisation is not always effectivedoes not mean that it should not be required at all.Legality andWeber safeguardsHaving declined to expand minimum safeguards, the Court proceeded to consider whether the regimesatisfied legality and the existingWeber safeguards. The Court determined that it would examine the legalframework, not at the point at which the applicants lodged their applications but at the date of the hearing.52This meant that the Court did not look at whether the regime had been operating on the basis of a clear,accessible and foreseeable legal framework, but rather whether in November 2017 it met the requirementsof legality. This allowed it to take into account changes that followed the Snowden revelations anddisclosures in the IPT proceedings.53 The Court also narrowed the scope of its inquiry by focusing not onwhether the legal framework was “accessible” (which would have entailed considering the applicants’argument that the scheme was too complex,54 a failing that the Anderson report had highlighted),55 butrather whether it was “foreseeable”.56 The Court thus proceeded to examine the regime vis-à-vis the sixminimum safeguards set out inWeber. It found that many of these safeguards were satisfied, but that theregime fell short in a few important respects.57First, it held that whilst the legislation gave citizens an adequate indication of the circumstances andthe conditions on which a warrant may be issued, the scope of the measures was broad and the onlyindependent oversight was ex post facto.58 The Court concluded that this was not enough in a bulkinterception regime where the discretion to intercept was not significantly curtailed by the terms of thewarrant.59 The Court thus determined that the safeguards governing selection of bearers for interception46 Szabo (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 3 at [77].47 Szabo (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 3 at [77].48Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [320].49Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [318].50Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [319].51Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15), Partly Concurring, Partly Dissenting Opinion of Judge Koskelo, joined byJudge Turkovic at [25].52Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [325].53Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [325].54Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [273].55 Independent Reviewer of Terrorism, “A Question of Trust”: Report of the Investigatory Powers Review by the Independent Reviewer of TerrorismLegislation (June 2015).56Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [327].57Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [358]–[374].58Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [328]–[347].59Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [328]–[347].Mass Surveillance and the European Court of Human Rights 593[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsand selection of intercepted material for examination were not sufficiently robust,60 and that there was anabsence of robust independent oversight of the selectors and search criteria used to filter interceptedcommunications.61The Court then proceeded to consider whether communications data should be subject to the samesafeguards as content data. In earlier cases the Court had clearly accepted that communications data isless intrusive, a distinction that is erroneous as communications data can be highly intrusive and moreintrusive than content data.62 In Big Brother Watch there were some signs of progress on this issue, butthe overall position remained somewhat ambiguous. The Court commenced its analysis by noting thatthus far it had declined to apply minimum safeguards where there was no interception of communications.63It determined, however, that it did not need to decide on these facts whether the minimum safeguardsshould apply to communications data because the domestic regime treats the two in the same way exceptfor in relation to the s.16 safeguards. The Court therefore focused on whether the Government’s justificationfor exempting communications data from the s.16 safeguards was proportionate.64 Inmaking that assessmentthe Court indicated that it was not convinced that communications data is necessarily less intrusivesuggesting that it may be willing to finally overturn the content/communications data distinction.65 Indeedit went on to determine that the UK did not strike a fair balance by exempting the regime entirely fromthe safeguards applicable to content data.66ProportionalityHaving found that the regime failed on the basis of legality the Court swiftly determined proportionalityin three brief paragraphs. First, it noted that the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation hadconcluded that no alternative or combination of alternatives would be sufficient.67 Second, it noted thatthe Venice Commission has acknowledged the intrinsic value of bulk surveillance.68 Third, it determinedthat there was no reason to disagree with these bodies.69 Having deferred to their expertise it concludedthat “it is clear that bulk interception is a valuable means to achieve the legitimate aim pursued, particularlygiven the current threat level from both global terrorism and serious crime”.70 There was no discussion ofthe impact on the right to privacy, nor the standard that the Court was applying in determiningproportionality. Indeed, whilst the report of the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism may have led theCourt to accept that there is no viable alternative which could pursue the legitimate aim of preservingnational security, its acceptance of surveillance as “a valuable means” of achieving that aim suggests thatthe bar may be somewhat lower than “no viable alternative”.71(ii) Intelligence sharing regimeThis was the first time that the Court has considered whether an intelligence sharing regime complies withthe Convention. Given the political nature of this task it was not surprising that the Court emphasised that60Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [328]–[347].61Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [347].62Uzun v Germany (2011) 53 E.H.R.R. 24.63Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [351].64Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [352].65Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [356].66Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [357].67Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [384].68Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [385].69Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [386].70Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [386].71Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [384] and [386].594 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsit was not considering the interception itself (which was an act of the US), but rather the receipt of thedata and its subsequent storage, examination and use by the intelligence services.72As noted above, the Court determined that it would examine the relevant legal framework at the dateof the 2017 hearing.73 This was critical to the intelligence sharing application because large parts of theregime were not publicly available at the time of the Snowden revelations. Indeed, the second IPT decisionheld that prior to the disclosures made in the IPT proceedings the regime contravened arts 8 or 10 of theECHR.74 Thus if the Court had examined the regime earlier it presumably would have found a violation.The applicants argued, however, that even following the 9 October disclosure there was no adequate basisin law. The argument that the disclosure did not provide an adequate legal basis seemed a compelling one,but by the time the Court heard the case the 9 October disclosure had been incorporated into the Interceptionof Communications Code of Practice, and thus the Court concluded that there “is now a basis in law” andthe issue fell away entirely.75The next challenge related to the application of safeguards. The applicants argued that Weber mustapply to intelligence sharing otherwise states would simply get around the limits by getting other statesto intercept and leaving the Contracting States free to use the data without being constrained by minimumsafeguards. For these reasons the Court agreed that Weber must apply to data received from intelligencesharing arrangements.76 It went on, however, to find that the regime satisfied the Weber safeguards.Moreover, when it came to determining whether the measures were proportionate the Court found oncemore that the threat of terrorism meant that these practices did not violate art.8 of the ECHR.77(iii) Acquisition of communications data under Chapter II of the RIPAFinally, the applicants argued that acquiring communications data was incompatible with art.8 of theECHR as the regime permitted acquisition in a wide range of circumstances that were ill-defined withfew limitations. Engaging with this substantively would have required the Court to consider whetherdifferent standards apply to content and communications data. The Court touched on this when it notedthat in Ben Faiza v France it had distinguished between methods of investigation that made it possible toidentify the geographical position of a person in the past or in real time and that real time was more likelyto violate private life.78 This is a further sign that the Court may be willing to break down the divisionbetween content and communications data, however, it also suggests that it may operate a second leveldistinction between transmission of existing communications data and transmission of real-timecommunications data such as ongoing monitoring or a tracking device on a vehicle.Whilst breaking downthe communications/content data divide is a welcome move, the invocation of a temporal element raisesits own difficult questions, in particular whether real-time really is more intrusive than historical data, andat what point does real-time data become historical data? Ultimately, however, the Court did not need todetermine these issues as the conflict between EU law (which restricts measures to those that are intendedto tackle serious crime) and the domestic legal framework (which did not limit the measures to tackling72Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [419]–[421].73Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [325].74 Liberty [2015] UKIPTrib 13_77-H (26 February 2015 judgment) at [32].75Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [427].76 If the situation were one in which the UK were seeking to avoid these limits by imploring the US to engage in surveillance on its behalf then thiswould appear to run contrary to the analogous principles expressed in the Court’s case-law as to whether an act of a private party is imputable to thestate. In cases where the state has relied upon the acts of private agents in carrying out surveillance the Court has not been willing to accept the argumentthat it was ultimately the third party “who was in control of events”. Indeed, the Court has recognised that “to accept such an argument would betantamount to allowing investigating authorities to evade their responsibilities under the Convention by the use of private agents”,MM v Netherlands(2004) 39 E.H.R.R. 19 at [40]. Where another state is concerned, however, the relevance of “control” under both the ECHR imputation approach andthe attribution of acts to states in international law causes difficulties, see Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [420].77Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [445]–[446].78Ben Faiza v France (App. No.31446/12), judgment of 8 February 2018, as cited in Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15)at [460]–[462].Mass Surveillance and the European Court of Human Rights 595[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsserious crime) meant that there was no clear legal basis for the measure.79 Thus having found a violationon this basis the Court did not have to determine the substantive matters.Articles 10, 6 and 14 of the ECHRIn addition to the two art.8 ECHR violations the Court also held that the bulk interception of data and theacquisition of communications data under Chapter II of the RIPA violated art.10 of the ECHR. It rejected,however, both the art.6 and art.14 ECHR applications as manifestly ill-founded. The art.6 ECHR complaintwas rejected on the basis that the closed proceedings did not call into question the independence andimpartiality of the IPT.80Whilst the Court rejected the art.14 ECHR claim on the grounds that the applicantshad not substantiated this claim, and that to the extent that there is a difference it is not based on nationalitybut on geographical location, this is not a personal characteristic and therefore does not amount todiscrimination.81 In any event, the Court determined that a difference based on geographical location wouldbe justified as the UK has considerable powers to investigate in the UK and does not have the same powersoutside the UK.82Separate and partly dissenting opinionsSeparate and dissenting opinions often offer important insight into division within the Court. Indeed, inBig Brother Watch it is evident that whilst the Finnish and Croatian judges were pushing for greatersafeguards,83 the UK and San Marino judges were pushing for a determination that the regimes werecompatible with art.8 of the ECHR.84 Given this 2:4:2 split within the Court, it is not surprising that a moretentative judgment emerged.The dissenting opinion of the Finnish and Croatian judges is particularly valuable for its insight intothe ramifications of bulk surveillance and the enormous risk of abuse that this entails, issues that werelargely absent from the Court’s analysis.85 It warns that we have to be cautious as states can invoke thethreat of terrorism loosely and opportunistically to legitimise interferences and that increasing degradationof respect for democratic standards and the rule of law necessitate heightened scrutiny on the part of theCourt.86 The dissent thus pulls towards an approach that would be more robust in safeguarding rights.Final reflections—where was the right to privacy?Having examined the substance of Big Brother Watch let us reflect on what this means for the Court’srole as guardian of the right to privacy. For decades the European Court of Human Rights has played avital role in ensuring that UK surveillance practices are governed by the rule of law. Until 1984 the UKconducted surveillance based entirely upon executive discretion with no legal framework establishinglimits upon that discretion. This was successfully challenged in Malone v United Kingdom, which led tothe enactment of the Interception of Communications Act 1985.87 A further ruling in Liberty v United79Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [463] and [466]–[468].80Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [501]–[513].81Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [514]–[519].82Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [518].83Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15), Partly Concurring, Partly Dissenting Opinion of Judge Koskelo, joined byJudge Turkovic.84Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15), Joint Partly Dissenting and Partly Concurring Opinion of Judges Pardalos andEicke.85Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15), Partly Concurring, Partly Dissenting Opinion of Judge Koskelo, joined byJudge Turkovic.86Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15), Partly Concurring, Partly Dissenting Opinion of Judge Koskelo, joined byJudge Turkovic at [11]–[15].87Malone v United Kingdom (1985) 7 E.H.R.R. 14.596 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsKingdom, found that the 1985 Act was also incompatible with the Convention.88 The Court has also foundlegal safeguards to be lacking in many other European countries. There is simply no comparablesupranational human rights court that has directly shaped the legal framework of state surveillance. Theimportance of the Court should thus not be underestimated.Moreover, right from the outset the Convention jurisprudence was grounded in Klass v Germany in anawareness that “[p]owers of secret surveillance of citizens, characterising as they do the police state, aretolerable under the Convention only in so far as strictly necessary for safeguarding the democraticinstitutions”.89 Indeed, in Klass the Court stressed that whilst states need to be able to respond to threatsof terrorism “this does not mean that the Contracting States enjoy an unlimited discretion to subject personswithin their jurisdiction to secret surveillance”.90 It also emphasised the danger that surveillance “posesof undermining or even destroying democracy on the ground of defending it” and thus states “may not inthe name of the struggle against espionage and terrorism, adopt whatever measures they deem appropriate”.91The important role that the Court has played in holding states to account is undermined by the widemargin of appreciation granted to states in Big Brother Watchwhich allows states to use bulk surveillanceand invoke the threat of terrorism seemingly without scrutiny. For example, when considering whetherbulk interception was a proportionate interference the Court simply declared that “[i]t is clear that bulkinterception is a valuable means to achieve the legitimate aims pursued, particularly given the currentthreat level from both global terrorism and serious crime”.92 Equally when it came to the intelligencesharing regime the Court went straight to the “difficulties faced by States in protecting their populationsfrom terrorist violence”93 and “the very real threat that Contracting States currently face on account ofinternational terrorism”.94 Before concluding that “[f]aced with such a threat, the Court has considered itlegitimate for Contracting States to take a firm stand against those who contribute to terrorist acts”95 andthat “taking such a stand—and thus preventing the perpetration of violent acts endangering the lives ofinnocent people—requires a flow of information between the security services of many countries in allparts of the world”.96 There is a distinct lack of acknowledgement throughout this that the right to privacyis sacrificed by accepting these measures.It is worth pausing to consider whether this is simply the result of a rise in deference and the dominanceof national security more generally. Deference and national security are certainly important factors, butif we do not engage with privacy and proportionality then this makes this all the more inevitable andproblematic. This is evident if we compare the Court’s analysis of art.8 of the ECHR with its analysis ofart.10 of the ECHR in Big Brother Watch, a right that equally came up against national security. Whenexamining whether the measures constituted a proportionate interference with art.10 of the ECHR, theCourt’s starting point was not national security, but rather the importance of freedom of expression.Reiterating its well-established position that “freedom of expression constitutes one of the essentialfoundations of a democratic society and that the safeguards to be afforded to the press are of particularimportance”.97Moreover, it emphasised that it subjects “the safeguards for respect of freedom of expressionin cases under Article 10 of the Convention to special scrutiny” and that “an interference cannot becompatible unless it is justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest”.98 Thus applying thisapproach it held that “in view of the potential chilling effect that any perceived interference might have88 Liberty (2009) 48 E.H.R.R. 1.89Klass v Germany (1979–80) 2 E.H.R.R. 214 at [42].90Klass (1979–80) 2 E.H.R.R. 214 at [49].91Klass (1979–80) 2 E.H.R.R. 214 at [49].92Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [386].93Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [445].94Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [445].95Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [446].96Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [446].97Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [487].98Big Brother Watch (App. Nos 58170/13, 62322/14 and 24960/15) at [488].Mass Surveillance and the European Court of Human Rights 597[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorson the freedom of the press and given the absence of safeguards there was a violation of Article 10”(emphasis added).99The Court’s approach to the two rights is markedly different, as whilst art.10 of the ECHR is anchoredby a clear conception of why the right is important and why interferences need to be justified, the art.8ECHR right appears to lack a similar clearly articulated normative weight. This is despite the fact thatthere is no hierarchy between freedom of expression and privacy in the Convention, and that on numerousoccasions the Court has stated that they are of equivalent status.100 Part of the problem is perhaps thatwhilst freedom of expression has always been lauded as a socially beneficial right,101 the right to privacyhas primarily developed in individualistic terms.102 Thus whilst “freedom of expression constitutes one ofthe essential foundations of a democratic society”, the societal functions of privacy are not as prominentin the Court’s analysis.103 And yet privacy has important societal benefits, in particular it acts as a bulwarkagainst totalitarianism,104 it provides the space in which ideas (particularly controversial ideas) can beformed, developed, explored and expressed,105 it fosters social relations,106 and by protecting privacy weprotect those that are typically subject to the most intrusive measures including ethnic and religiousminorities, and those of low socio-economic status.107Thus privacy contributes to a democratic, intellectuallyvibrant, harmonious and egalitarian society. These features, although evidently not guaranteed by privacyalone, may be jeopardised by a loss of privacy.There are inevitable difficulties associated with translating abstract rights and the intangible nature ofhuman experiences into legal decision-making, but to evaluate rights we need to have the best possibleunderstanding of what they entail. A way forward for the Court is to bring to the fore a stronger statementof the importance of privacy. Not simply a statement of abstract principles, but rather the foundation forthe Court’s analysis, namely that privacy is valuable and that intrusions need to be justified. This shouldthen feed into greater engagement with proportionality in the same way that the Court engages with otherrights.108 This does not mean that privacy will triumph, the Court might find that national security trumpsprivacy, but in making that determination we need to be clear that the right is being sacrificed.

Representing a first in England, eligible voters in fiveareas were required to produce some form of ID when voting in polling stations. This attracted muchcriticism amidst concerns that some individuals would be disenfranchised and denied their right to vote.Reflecting upon the conduct of the pilots and the official statistics subsequently published about them, aswell as the author’s own observations at polling stations and other stakeholder feedback, this articleargues that the 2018 pilots were too limited and inconclusive to draw any support for voter identificationlaws in England, but should the Government proceed with its proposals, it must do so with the utmostcaution to avoid disenfranchisement. Moreover, in order to uphold the right to free elections under art.3of the First Protocol to the ECHR, it is imperative that further research is carried out and adequatesafeguards are put in place before a nationwide roll-out is considered, especially given the UK’s unusualposition of lacking a Government-issued national identity card.(1) IntroductionIn the May 2018 local elections in England, a pilot scheme with the stated aim of combatting electoralfraud was carried out which required eligible voters in Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Wokingto present some form of identification before voting in polling stations.1 In the run-up to the elections, theproposals attracted political criticism primarily from opposition parties, amidst concerns that some voterswould be disenfranchised and that certain groups would be disproportionately affected by the introductionof compulsory identification requirements. For example, following an urgent question on the matter tothe Minister for the Cabinet Office in April 2018, the Labour Party’s Shadow Minister for VoterEngagement and Youth Affairs, Cat Smith, claimed that the pilot scheme would introduce “discriminatorymeasures that could disenfranchise legitimate voters who already face a multitude of barriers to democraticengagement”.2 Representatives of the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats voiced similar*Lecturer in Law, Coventry University.

Despite these initial apprehensions, the voter ID pilots took placeon 3 May 2018. Shortly after, the Cabinet Office pledged to hold further pilots in May 2019,8 owing towhat the Government deemed to be a successful initial round of pilots.The human rights implications of compulsory voter identification laws have already been discussedin depth elsewhere,9 insofar as art.3 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights(ECHR) requires contracting parties to “hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, underconditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature”.Bearing in mind the principles underpinning art.3 of the First Protocol to the ECHR, the underlying purposeof this article is to evaluate the voter ID pilots, from conception to delivery, in light of the official statisticsdisseminated following the pilots as well as the author’s own observations and other stakeholder feedback.In that respect, in addition to the data collated and disseminated by each respective council, the ElectoralCommission produced a substantial report on the pilot scheme in July 2018 pursuant to the requirementsof the Representation of the People Act (RPA) 2000,10 which provides much food for thought. Moreover,this article also draws upon the author’s own observations at polling stations in two of the participatingareas on the day of the local elections in May 2018, each of which imposed different identificationrequirements.11 This article also draws upon the comments and reflections of the Chief Electoral Officerof the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI), Virginia McVea, from an interview conducted inAugust 2018 for the purposes of this research. These experiences were invaluable to the task of attemptingto better understand and appreciate the practicalities of voter identification requirements.3A.

Section 3 then evaluates the success of the pilots in each participatingarea from the perspective of the right to vote, relying upon the official statistics subsequently published,as well as the feedback of other stakeholders and the author’s own observations at polling stations. Finally,Section 4 concludes.(2) The authorisation and conduct of the voter ID pilot schemeOn 14 January 2018, the Minister for the Cabinet Office made a series of Ministerial Orders authorisingthe voter ID pilots to take place in Bromley,12 Gosport,13 Swindon,14 Watford15 and Woking respectively,16pursuant to his powers under s.10 of the RPA 2000. Themanner in which the pilots were legally authorisedin each area has, however, been criticised, with some suggesting that the Minister acted ultra vires bymaking Orders to allow the local authorities to require identification, when Parliamentary approval shouldhave been sought instead.17In essence, s.10 of the RPA 2000 allows the Secretary of State to make an Order which authorises pilotschemes for local elections in England and Wales, following a proposal from a local authority and theElectoral Commission.18 The Act states that such a pilot scheme would allow for changes in respect ofone or more of the following general ways: when, where and how voting at the elections is to take place;how the votes cast at the elections are to be counted; or the sending by candidates of electioncommunications free of charge for postage.19Although not limiting or proscribing exactly what requirementsand processes could be authorised in a pilot, the Act states that a scheme could authorise voting to takeplace on more than one day and at places other than polling stations, or that postal charges incurred bycandidates sending election communications could be paid by the authority concerned.20The Act’s explanatory notes provide some further, helpful guidance on this matter, stating that theevaluations which must be published by the Electoral Commission after the elections must include “anassessment of the scheme in facilitating voting and (if relevant) the counting process or in encouragingvoting or enabling voters to make informed decisions”,21 and also “a statement as to whether in the localauthority’s opinion: turnout was higher than it would otherwise have been; voters found the newarrangements easy to use; the new procedures led to any increase in personation or other electoral fraud;the procedures led to an increase or to savings in expenditure”.22 As such, this language might suggest atthe outset that the purpose of s.10 of the RPA 2000 envisaged pilot schemes being authorised with a viewto enabling wider participation, rather than limiting wider participation, as compulsory identificationrequirements may well do.In that respect, a circular published and disseminated by the Home Office in 2000, which for the firsttime provided guidance to local authorities considering running a pilot scheme in an election, stated thatthe application to hold a pilot must give “an assurance that no voter will be put at a disadvantage by theproposed innovation”.23 Whilst this requirement seems to have mostly thwarted proposals that would havedisadvantaged a particular religious group,24 the imposition of additional barriers at the point of voting,12London Borough of Bromley (Identification in Polling Stations) Pilot Order 2018.13Gosport Borough Council (Identification in Polling Stations) Pilot Order 2018.14 Swindon Borough Council (Identification in Polling Stations) Pilot Order 2018.15Watford Borough Council (Identification in Polling Stations) Pilot Order 2018.16Woking Borough Council (Identification in Polling Stations) Pilot Order 2018.17 P.

Rather, the participating local authorities had carriedthese out instead, which has drawn some criticism owing to the specific, continuous and ongoing dutyupon Government departments and ministers to comply with the PSED.27Insofar as the actual conduct of the voter ID pilot scheme is concerned, the five participating areas inthe 2018 voter pilots—Bromley, Gosport, Swindon,Watford andWoking—each had particular identificationrequirements that eligible voters were required to satisfy to vote on 3 May 2018. Given the UK’s unusualposition of lacking a Government-issued national identity card, the varying councils were afforded greaterdiscretion about the acceptable identification than they might otherwise have been given. Individuals inWatford and Swindon were required to produce their polling cards which contained a unique barcode.28Where voters had forgotten or lost their polling cards, or in situations when the cards could not be verified,other photographic identification was accepted.29 The requirements in Bromley, Gosport andWoking weremore complex, as voters were required to produce a specific form of identification.First, voters in Bromley were required to produce either a UK, Commonwealth or EU passport; a UK,Crown Dependency or EU photocard driving licence; a Northern Ireland Electoral Identity Card (EIC);a biometric immigration document issued in the UK; a European Economic Area (EEA) identity card; anOyster 60+ London Pass; a London Freedom Pass; or a PASS scheme card (national proof of age standardsscheme).30 If voters did not possess one of these forms of identification, they could produce a combinationof two alternative forms of identification, one of which had to show their registered address.3125Equality Act 2010 s.149.26Letter from Clare Collier (Senior Principal: Legal, Equality and Human Rights Commission) to David Lidington MP (Minister for the CabinetOffice) (11 April 2018), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/707429/20180411_EHRC_letter_to_Cabinet_Office.pdf [Accessed 10 November 2018].27Letter from Chloe Smith MP (Minister for the Constitution) to David Isaac (Chair, Equality and Human Rights Commission) (23 April 2018),https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/707137/Letter_to_David_Isaac_CBE__2.pdf[Accessed 10 November 2018]; Letter from David Isaac (Chair, Equality and Human Rights Commission) to Chloe Smith MP (Minister for theConstitution) (14 May 2018), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/707681/20180514-EHRC-letter-to-CO.pdf [Accessed 10 November 2018]; Letter from Chloe Smith MP (Minister for the Constitution) to David Isaac (Chair, Equalityand Human Rights Commission) (16 May 2018), https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/707726/MFC1307-response.pdf [Accessed 10 November 2018].28Electoral Commission, “May 2018 Voter Identification Schemes: Findings and Recommendations” (July 2018), Appendix A.29Voters in Watford whose polling cards could not be verified were required to produce any of the following alternative forms of photographicidentification: Valid British, European or Commonwealth passport; UK or EU photo-card driving licence (full or provisional); Valid credit or debitcard; Biometric Residence Permit; EEA Identity Card; or a Northern Ireland Electoral Identity Card. Voters in Swindon whose polling cards could notbe verified were required to produce any of the following alternative forms of photographic identification: Passport (UK, EU, Commonwealth) (canbe expired or unexpired); Photocard driving licence including a provisional licence (UK, Crown Dependency or EU); Northern Ireland ElectoralIdentity Card; Biometric Immigration Document; EEA Identity Card. Alternatively, voters in Swindon who lacked appropriate identification couldhave their identities attested by two residents who vote at the same polling station, one of whom must have already voted and had their ID verified.30Electoral Commission, “May 2018 Voter Identification Schemes: Findings and Recommendations” (July 2018), Appendix A.31Specifically, these were: a valid bank or building society debit card or credit card; a poll card for the poll; a driving licence (including a provisionallicence) which is not in the form of a photocard; a birth certificate; a marriage or civil partnership certificate; an adoption certificate; a firearms certificateThe 2018 English Local Elections ID Pilots and the Right to Vote: A Vote of (No) Confidence? 603[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe requirements in Gosport were slightly different, as voters were required to produce either a UK,Commonwealth or EU passport; a UK, Crown Dependency or EU photocard driving licence; a NorthernIreland EIC; a biometric immigration document; an EEA identity card; a Disclosure and Barring Servicecertificate showing a registered address; a Ministry of Defence (MoD) photographic identity card; a MoDDefence Privilege Card; or a photographic travel pass from any Hampshire council.32 Like in Bromley, ifvoters did not possess one of these forms of identification, they could produce a combination of twoalternative forms of identification, one of which had to show their registered address.33Lastly, the requirements inWoking were arguably the strictest of all, as voters were required to produceeither a UK, Commonwealth or EU passport; a UK or EU driver’s licence; an EEA photographic identitycard; a UK biometric residence permit; a Northern Ireland EIC; a Surrey Senior Buss Pass; a SurreyDisabled People’s Bus Pass; a Surrey Student Fare Card; a 16–25 Railcard; a Rail Season Ticket Photocard;or, if the individual did not possess one of the principal forms of identification, a Local Elector Card.34Unlike Bromley and Gosport, however, other non-photographic forms of identification were not permitted.(3) Evaluating the success of the voter ID pilot: a vote of (no) confidence?When confronted with applications concerning the right to vote under art.3 of the First Protocol to theECHR, the European Court of Human Rights has stressed that a number of requirements must be met forany restrictions upon the right to be lawful under the Convention.35 The measures taken by contractingparties such as the UKmust not curtail the right to vote in a way that impairs its essence and effectiveness;the conditions imposed must be proportionate and pursue a legitimate aim; the free expression of thepeople must not be thwarted; the requirement must be concerned with the integrity and effectiveness ofthe election process; and, if relevant, the exclusion of any group of the public must be reconcilable withthe purpose of art.3 of the First Protocol.36 Furthermore, although voter identification is, on the face of it,a neutral policy that would concern all eligible voters, the European Court of Human Rights has made itclear that “a difference in treatment may take the form of disproportionately prejudicial effects of a generalpolicy or measure which, although couched in neutral terms, discriminates against a group”.37Whilst there are numerous ways to measure the success of an election from a human rights perspective,arguably themost relevant and quantifiable way of doing so amidst concerns of potential disenfranchisementconcerns voter turnout, confidence in the security of the voting process, and crucially, the amount ofeligible voters prevented from voting and effectively disenfranchised for failing to produce the requiredidentification to polling station workers. In light of the fundamental principles that underpin the right tovote under art.3 of the First Protocol to the ECHR outlined above, it is essential to examine these threeissues in particular in order to reach a grounded conclusion. They will help to shed some light upon thedirect consequences of voter identification laws in England in a number of ways, not least of all whethergranted under the Firearms Act 1968; the record of a decision on bail made in respect of the voter in accordance with s.5(1) of the Bail Act 1976; abank or building society cheque book; a mortgage statement dated within 3 months of the date of the poll; a bank or building society statement datedwithin 3 months of the date of the poll; a credit card statement dated within 3 months of the date of the poll; a utility bill dated within 3 months of thedate of the poll; a council tax demand letter or statement dated within 12 months of the date of the poll; a Form P45 or Form P60 dated within 12months of the date of the poll.32Electoral Commission, “May 2018 Voter Identification Schemes: Findings and Recommendations” (July 2018), Appendix A.33 Specifically, these were: a driving licence without photo; a birth certificate; an adoption certificate; a marriage or civil partnership certificate; abank or building society debit/credit card. Subject to it being issued within 12 months of voting day, voters could also produce a financial statementsuch as a bank or mortgage statement; a council tax demand letter or statement; a utility bill; a P2, P6, P9, P45 or P60 form; or a statement of benefitsor entitlement to benefits.34Electoral Commission, “May 2018 Voter Identification Schemes: Findings and Recommendations” (July 2018), Appendix A.35B.

Nevertheless, before exploringthe results of the voter ID pilots in more detail, it will be useful to briefly consider some of the mostsignificant and immediate factors that may have accounted to some extent for the fluctuations in turnoutin the 2018 local elections when compared to the 2014 elections, when the seats were last contested.Whilst the local elections in May 2014 were held simultaneously with the last European Parliamentelections, the May 2018 polling day only covered local elections, so a higher voter turnout in 2014 mightbe expected when more was at stake. On a different note, there are growing concerns that so-called “voterfatigue” may be contributing to a decrease in voter turnout.38 Looking at the electoral history across thefive participating areas since 2014, voters have been regularly polled, on a yearly basis in some areas, invarious local, county and mayoral elections39; the 2014 European Parliament elections; the 2015 and 2017General Elections; the 2016 Police and Crime Commissioner elections40; and the 2016 EU Referendum.As a result, voter fatigue might have contributed to a decrease in voter turnout in 2018 when comparedto 2014.On the other hand, the publicity drive to raise awareness about the identification requirements in thefive areas was commendable and extremely visible, prompting themanaging director and returning officerofWatford Borough Council to assert, quite fairly, that there had been “good advertising” for the elections.41In that respect, according to the Electoral Commission, 86% of people who voted in polling stations inthe five participating areas were aware of the need to bring identification.42 As such, the enhanced effortsto inform voters about the voter ID requirements, and therefore of the election itself by default, may haveaccounted for a small increase in voter turnout in the 2018 local elections.43In terms of the actual voter turnout in each of the five areas that participated in the 2018 voter ID pilots,turnout increased in Swindon and Watford where voters were required to produce their polling cards,when compared to the 2014 local elections when the seats were last contested.44However, turnout marginally38 P.

Banducci, “Local Elections and Voter ID Pilots”, ExeterQ-Step Centre (2018).44 In Swindon turnout increased from 33% to 40%, whereas in Watford turnout increased from 37% to 39.3%. See R.

Nevertheless, given what is at stake with the riskof widespread disenfranchisement, caution is all the more necessary if attempting to point to these resultsas evidence that voter identification would have a minimal impact upon the turnout at more significantelections such as general elections or referendums.As voter turnout is traditionally poor in UK local elections in comparison to general elections andreferendums,46 it could be safely assumed that individuals who vote in local elections are more likely tobe politically engaged than those who only vote in general elections and referendums. According to theElectoral Commission and their voter survey in 2017, those who claim to “always vote” at elections arelikely to have comprised the majority of voters at the local government and combined authority mayoralelections in May 2017.47 Moreover, the Electoral Commission concluded that “‘always voters’ are morelikely to view voting as a civic duty compared to ‘sometimes voters’, whose motivations change dependingon the context of the poll”.48As such, it might be reasonable to expect that individuals who consistently vote at local elections, aswell as other elections deemed to be less significant than general elections and referendums, are moreconscientious about the rules and regulations of voting than those who only vote in general elections andreferendums. These voters might therefore be more likely to ensure that they satisfied whatever the votingrequirements were well in advance of polling.Caution is also necessary when confronted with the issue of representation in the 2018 voter ID pilots,given the obvious lack of diversity in the five participating areas when compared to the overall electoratein the UK. In addition to the clear geographical limitation of the five participating areas, i.e. the fact thatall five areas are located in the South of England and three had a close proximity to London, questionscan also be asked about the diversity of the areas in other more subtle ways.For example, in respect of unemployment rates, the five participating areas all had below-averagepercentages compared to the national average of 4.2%, with Woking being the furthest afield at 2.4%.49Furthermore, the Electoral Commission 2017 voter survey revealed that “always voters” who were, asdiscussed earlier, likely to have comprised the majority of voters at the local government elections in May2017, were “more likely to be over 35 years old, white and from socio-economic group AB”.50 Accordingto the National Readership Survey of social grades in 2016, this particular combined socio-economicgroup comprises just 27% of the population in the UK.51Although now slightly outdated, the 2011 Census revealed that whereas 23% of all individuals inEngland belonged to the AB social grade, Bromley,Watford andWoking all had a much higher percentageof individuals in the highest social grades at that time, whereas Swindon had a marginally smallerpercentage, and only Gosport had a significantly lower percentage.52 Voters in the AB social grade are45 In Bromley turnout decreased from 41% to 40%, in Gosport turnout decreased from 33.5% to 33%, and in Woking turnout decreased from 38.7%to 37.8%.

See Office for National Statistics, “2011 Census”, https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census [Accessed 10 November 2018].606 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsalso much more likely to vote for the Conservative Party, as demonstrated in the three most recent GeneralElections in 2017,53 2015,54 and 2010.55 More troubling, however, the Electoral Commission revealed that18% of voters in the C2DE social grades in the pilot areas in May 2018 said they were not aware of thevoter ID requirements in their respective areas, compared to only 9% of voters in the ABC1 social grade.56As such, serious questions can be asked as to whether the five areas were adequately representative ofthe different socio-economic groups that comprise the electorate in England, in order to draw any definitivesupport for a wider implementation of voter ID laws. At this stage it is also necessary to recognise theimportance of art.14 of the ECHR which provides that the enjoyment of human rights, such as the rightto vote under art.3 of the First Protocol, must be secured without unlawful discrimination on any groundsuch as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, associationwith a national minority, property, birth or other status.57 Given the low unemployment rates and lack ofdiversity in the five participating areas in terms of socio-economic status, and the lack of awareness aboutthe identification requirements amongst the lower C2DE social grades, more evidence is plainly neededto demonstrate that stringent identification requirements would not have a discriminatory impact in areaswith higher unemployment rates or areas with a greater proportion of voters who fall into the lowersocio-economic grades.In terms of ethnic diversity, the five participating areas were slightly more representative of the overallelectorate in the UK. The 2011 Census revealed that whereas 79.8% of all individuals in England werewhite (English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British), the percentages were slightly lower in Bromleyand Woking, and significantly lower in Watford than England overall, meaning that there was greaterethnic diversity in those three areas, whereas the figures were much higher in Gosport and Swindon,meaning that there was less ethnic diversity in those areas.58Bearing these issues in mind, it is perhaps surprising that the decrease in turnout was not more prevalentin the three areas with the more stringent identification requirements, where some voters faced the extraburden, however small, of obtaining acceptable identification. In comparison, eligible voters in Swindonand Watford were not required to do anything other than produce their polling cards posted directly totheir address. Whilst this would obviously pose a challenge to voters without a fixed address, such as thehomeless or travellers in particular, the process of registering to vote still requires eligible individuals toidentify a location or address with which they have some connection, and so these voters would be morelikely to face the risk of disenfranchisement at the point of registration rather than actual voting. Votersin Swindon and Watford, therefore, were not subject to the same burden as voters in Bromley, Gosportand Woking. As such, unless adequate measures are put in place, there is a real concern that stringentvoter identification requirements could exacerbate the difficulties that individuals with no fixed addresssuch as the homeless or travellers already face, and could perhaps even be discriminatory against suchindividuals owing to their property status.Ultimately, given the complexities of voter turnout and the lack of diversity in the five participatingareas, the statistics concerning voter turnout in the five participating areas do not tell us enough about theimpact of voter identification laws upon the right to vote to draw any definitive conclusions.

However, to paint the full picture it is crucial to consider theviews of those who voted but also those who administered the elections. In terms of voter confidence, theElectoral Commission’s public opinion survey in the May 2018 local elections suggested that just 15%of respondents in pilot areas thought that there had been “a lot” or “a little” electoral fraud or abuse on 3May, whereas 37% of respondents in non-pilot areas thought the same.59 In contrast, 43% of respondentsin pilot areas thought there had been “hardly any” electoral fraud or abuse, or “nothing at all”, whereas34% of respondents in non-pilot areas thought as such.60 More generally, 63% of respondents in Bromleyand 57% of respondents in Gosport said that an identification requirement wouldmake themmore confidentin the security of the voting system, whereas the majority of people in Swindon, Watford and Wokingsaid it would make no difference.61Given that combatting electoral fraud was the stated aim for the voter ID pilots,62 which is obviouslya legitimate aim and one essential to the task of ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of the electionprocess, the voter ID pilots in May 2018 appear to have been a success and the strongest argument insupport of voter identification laws from a human rights perspective.However, other findings suggest that polling station workers are unconvinced that electoral fraud is asignificant problem. Based upon a survey of polling station workers conducted in 42 local authoritieswhich did not participate in the voter ID pilots in May 2018, just 1% of over 2,000 respondents reportedat least one suspected case of electoral fraud.63 Suspected electoral fraud was, in fact, only the eighth mostcommonly reported problem, after much more pronounced issues such as individuals not being on thevoting register and disabled voters having difficulties completing ballot papers.64 Interestingly, based uponthe responses of polling station workers in local authorities that did participate in the voter ID pilots, anidentical percentage (1%) of workers reported suspected electoral fraud.65To put these views into perspective, there were 28 allegations of personation at a polling station acrossall elections in the UK in 2017, of which just one resulted in a successful prosecution and conviction.66This actually represents an improvement from 2016 when there were 44 allegations which also resultedin just one successful prosecution and conviction.6759Electoral Commission, “May 2018 Voter Identification Schemes: Findings and Recommendations” (July 2018), Chart 2.60Electoral Commission, “May 2018 Voter Identification Schemes: Findings and Recommendations” (July 2018), Chart 2.61Electoral Commission, “May 2018 Voter Identification Schemes: Findings and Recommendations” (July 2018), para.1.77.62Cabinet Office, “Voter ID Pilot to Launch in Local Elections”, Press Release (16 September 2017).63T.

For example, at the 1983 UK GeneralElection, nearly 1,000 tendered ballots had to be issued to eligible voters in Northern Ireland, as someonehad already voted in their name.68 At the same election, the then Royal Ulster Constabulary made 149arrests for personation, resulting in 104 prosecutions.69 Following the introduction of compulsoryphotographic identification in 2003, just 55 tendered ballots were issued in Northern Ireland at the 2005UK General Election which represented a “94% reduction compared to 1983”.70 These figures stand instark contrast to the 2017 General Election when, as already discussed, there was just 28 allegations ofpersonation in the entire UK, resulting in just one successful prosecution.71 Although the introduction ofvoter ID reforms in Northern Ireland in the 1980s maywell have been a justified and proportionate responseto the problem of electoral fraud, the situation in the rest of the UK today is radically different and it ismuch harder to justify stringent identification requirements as a proportionate response.72Even so, whilst confidence in the integrity of the election process in Northern Ireland improvedsignificantly following the introduction of photographic identification,73 the amount of people who thoughtthat “a lot” or “a little” electoral fraud took place in the 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly elections was,surprisingly perhaps, no less than comparable regional elections in the rest of the UK. The exact figure,28%, was precisely the same as the proportion of people who thought “a lot” or “a little” electoral fraudtook place in the English local government elections that year, and it was in fact marginally higher thanthe proportion of people who thought that “a lot” or “a little” fraud took place in the Scottish local counciland Welsh local government elections.74Ultimately, whilst the aim of combating electoral fraud appears to be relatively unproblematic from ahuman rights perspective and, in reality, it is the strongest argument in favour of voter identification laws,the fact remains that fraud and personation at polling stations is of a very low concern in the rest of theUK, both in terms of anecdotal feedback from polling station workers but also insofar as there are minimalallegations and almost zero successful convictions of the crime. Whereas the perception of electoral fraudin Northern Ireland was undoubtedly a serious problem in the past whichmay have justified the introductionof identification requirements, the problem has been mostly confined to that country.Bearing in mind that one of the fundamental legal principles underpinning the right to free electionsunder art.3 of the First Protocol to the ECHR is that the conditions imposed upon the right to vote mustbe proportionate, the next section illustrates that whilst combatting electoral fraud may well be a legitimateobjective, the potential consequences of harsh identification requirements when compared to the relativelyinsignificant problem of electoral fraud outside of Northern Ireland may be too significant to ignore.(c) Rejection at polling stationsThe most controversial and arguably the most significant set of statistics from a human rights perspectiveconcerns the number of eligible voters refused a ballot paper for failing to produce the required68Lord Elton, HL Deb 19 December 1983, vol.446, col.575; S.

Whilst these individuals were not denied their right to vote at the stage of registration, orwhen entering the polling station, they were effectively disenfranchised nonetheless for failing to complywith the requirements at the point of requesting a ballot paper in order to cast their vote. Initially, thenon-governmental organisation Democracy Volunteers revealed that its observers at various pollingstations in the five areas had witnessed 1.67% of voters being initially turned away for failing to producethe correct form of identification.75 Based upon this figure, the Electoral Reform Society subsequentlyestimated that almost 4,000 voters in total across the five areas had been turned away at polling stations.76These estimates have, however, been doubted by the Association of Electoral Administrators andseveral Members of Parliament in a recent debate.77 Moreover, these figures have not been supported bythe official statistics subsequently released by the five participating councils and the Electoral Commission.Whilst the statistics compiled by the various councils suggest that nearly 700 voters were initially turnedaway from polling stations for failing to produce the required identification, just under half later returnedwith the correct documentation.78 Ultimately, in the areas where voters were required to produce theirpolling cards, 25 voters were turned away at polling stations in Swindon, representing 0.06% of all whovoted,79 whereas in Watford the figure was estimated at 42–66, representing approximately 0.2% of allwho voted.80 In the areas where a specific form of identification was required, 154 voters were turnedaway in Bromley, representing 0.2% of all who voted,81 whereas the figures were 54 in Gosport,82 and 51in Woking,83 representing 0.4% and 0.3% of all who voted respectively.As such, around 350 eligible voters who attempted to vote were unable to in the five areas for failingto produce the required identification. According to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet Office,this represented “just 0.06% of the electorate and 0.14% of votes cast”.84 These figures do not, of course,account for those voters who simply stayed away from polling stations on the day due to their lack ofappropriate identification in the first place.On the face of it, these figures may seem trivial and dispel some doubts about the potential risk ofwidespread disenfranchisement. However, these results are more alarming if a similar proportion of voterswere, hypothetically speaking, rejected when attempting to vote in the 2016 Referendum on the UK’smembership of the EU, in which 28,455,402 votes were cast in England alone.85 Taking the official statisticsfrom the voter ID pilot scheme at face value, assuming at best that 0.06% of all voters would have beenunable to present the required identification and did not return, this wouldmean that over 17,000 individualsin England may have been rejected at polling stations in the Referendum. At worst, assuming that 0.4%of all voters would have been unable to present identification and did not return, almost 114,000 individualsin England may have been rejected.75 J.

Although at oneextreme it is interesting to note that the smallest majority currently enjoyed by a sitting Member ofParliament is just two votes.87 In that respect, 54 people were unable to vote in Gosport, which is itselfalso a parliamentary constituency. As noted elsewhere, this figure is more than the winning majority ineight parliamentary seats at the 2017 General Election.88(d) A vote of (no) confidence in voter identification? Lessons from Northern IrelandGiven that the European Court of Human Rights has stated that the right to vote is not a privilege,89 andthat the presumption in democratic states “must be in favour of inclusion”,90 any reforms which mightchallenge universal suffrage must always be subject to careful scrutiny. Whilst the Court has afforded awide margin of appreciation to states when it comes to organising and running electoral systems,91 eachmust still comply with certain fundamental principles that underpin the right.On the one hand, the increase in voter confidence in the security of the voting process is certainly thestrongest argument in favour of voter identification laws, and it would appear to satisfy the requirementunder the ECHR that the conditions imposed upon the right to vote must pursue a legitimate aim. Suchan aim is also inherently connected to the task of ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of the electionprocess.92However, the impact upon voter turnout remains a grey area in need of further research to ensure thatthe essence and effectiveness of the right to vote for eligible voters in the UK is not impaired.93 Moreimportantly, the fact that around 350 individuals were unable to vote in the May 2018 voter ID pilots may,quite justifiably, prompt suggestions that strict identification requirements do not comply with thefundamental principle that the conditions imposed upon the right to vote must be proportionate.94 The riskof disenfranchisement is even more difficult to defend in light of the fact that personation at polling stationsin Great Britain is, relatively speaking, of very little concern.Although Government ministers have been quick to herald the pilot scheme as a success and pledgedto facilitate further pilots in 2019,95 the doubts expressed in this article about the appropriateness of drawingany definitive support from the 2018 pilots for a national roll-out in the future have been reinforcedelsewhere. The primary recommendation from the Electoral Commission’s recent evaluation is that theGovernment should ensure that a wider range of local councils run pilot schemes in the 2019 local elections,due to the lack of diversity in the five areas that participated in the 2018 pilots.96 In that regard, it isimperative that the next round of pilots includes areas in Northern England, the Midlands and Wales97;areas with a greater proportion of voters in low socio-economic groups; areas with a greater proportionof ethnic minorities; as well as university towns and cities and areas with high unemployment rates, whichthe Electoral Reform Society has also advocated.9886Electoral Commission, “Voting in 2017: Understanding Public Attitudes Towards Elections and Voting” (October 2017), para.2.2.87 In North East Fife.

Given the likelihood that compulsory identification laws will be rolled out nationwide,it is pertinent to briefly consider some of the practical lessons that can be learned from Northern Ireland.For example, it is extremely likely, and arguably essential from a human rights perspective, that theGovernment would consider the creation of a voter identification card for those eligible voters in GreatBritain who might otherwise lack appropriate identification. It is also likely that such an identificationcard would be issued free of charge, given that one minister confirmed that individuals voting in the May2018 voter ID pilots would not have to spend any money,99 and the fact that the council with the moststringent requirements in the 2018 voter ID pilot, Woking, issued a “Local Elector Card” free of charge.Such a process would be a considerable administrative and financial undertaking. In 2003–2004, whenphotographic identification was first required in Northern Ireland, over 89,000 Electoral Identity Cards(EICs) were issued in Northern Ireland.100 Bearing in mind that the total electorate in Northern Ireland in2003 for parliamentary elections was a little over 1 million,101 the issuing of over 89,000 EICs representedapproximately 9% of the electorate. If a similar percentage of the total electorate in England, ScotlandandWales requested a Government-issued voter identity card for the parliamentary election in 2017, whenthe combined electorate was 45.6 million,102 this would mean that approximately 4 million cards mighthave been needed.Clearly, if a national roll-out of voter identification does take place, adequate resources and infrastructurewould be needed to ensure that these applications could be processed in a reasonable time to ensure thatno eligible voter was disenfranchised. In light of the recent experience in Northern Ireland, and also inthe US where the courts have not looked favourably upon voter ID laws which create real or hiddenfinancial hurdles,103 the Cabinet Office would have to bear the entirety of this cost in the UK, creatingobvious financial consequences in a time of significant budgetary constraint.(4) ConclusionsThis article has attempted to evaluate the success of the voter ID pilots that were conducted in five areasin the English local elections in May 2018. Bearing in mind the concerns discussed in this article, shouldthe Government proceed to consider a national roll-out of compulsory identification requirements, itcannot credibly do so by pointing to the success of the 2018 pilot scheme alone. Despite the legitimaterationale provided by the Government for reform and the demonstrable increase in voter confidence inthe five participating areas, voter identification laws are open to accusations of being disproportionategiven the potential risk of a drop in voter turnout and the fact that several hundred eligible voters wereeffectively denied the right to vote in the May 2018 pilots. Owing to the lack of diversity in the fiveparticipating areas, further research is also needed to ensure that stringent identification requirements donot discriminate against certain individuals.The Government must demonstrate that it has considered and adequately responded to the fundamentalconcerns discussed in this article and elsewhere, before contemplating a full nationwide roll-out. In thatrespect, it is imperative that the voter ID pilots in May 2019 involve a wider range of local councils, as99C.

Given that the very purpose of a pilot is to test potential reforms, the participatingcouncils should also consider the possibility of allowing provisional ballots, as practised in some USstates, which would further reduce the risk of disenfranchisement. Ultimately, whilst the Government’sstated rationale for voter identification reforms in the UK remains sound, the case for a national roll-outat this moment in time remains far from convincing.104Electoral Commission, “May 2018 Voter Identification Schemes: Findings and Recommendations” (July 2018), p.2; Electoral Reform Society,“Voters Locked Out: The Flaws of Voter ID in England” (April 2018).The 2018 English Local Elections ID Pilots and the Right to Vote: A Vote of (No) Confidence? 613[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCase AnalysisTakingReligiousMinorities Seriously:Hamidovicv Bosnia and HerzegovinaKaushik Paul*Bosnia and Herzegovina; Contempt of court; Dress codes; Freedom to manifest one’s religious belief;WitnessesAbstractOn 5 December 2017, the European Court of Human Rights gave a ruling in Hamidovic v Bosnia andHerzegovina, ultimately finding that the applicant’s charge of contempt of court for refusing to removea religious skullcap was a disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of religion under art.9of the European Convention onHuman Rights. The seven-panel Court issued four opinions in this judgment:two concurring opinions as well as one dissenting opinion alongside the majority opinion. From theperspective of Muslims’ religious freedom in Europe, this is a significant case because almost all of thecomplaints as to the prohibition on wearing Islamic dress were previously rejected by the European Courtof Human Rights. The aim of this article is to offer a critical analysis of the Court’s judgment inHamidovicv Bosnia and Herzegovina from the perspective of religious liberty.IntroductionOn 5 December 2017, the European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter the Strasbourg Court) issued asignificant judgment against the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Hamidovic v Bosnia andHerzegovina1 (hereinafterHamidovic), a case concerning the prohibition on wearing a skullcap, a religioussymbol, in the courtroom. The Strasbourg Court held, by six votes to one, that there had been a violationof his right to freedom of religion under art.9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (hereinafterthe Convention or the ECHR). In this case, the Strasbourg Court re-emphasised the need for pluralismand tolerance in a liberal democratic society and confirmed thatMember States’ widemargin of appreciationin the field of religious freedom is not unlimited. This article aims to offer a systematic analysis of theStrasbourg Court’s judgment in Hamidovic from the perspective of religious liberty.The background of the caseThe applicant, Mr Husmet Hamidovic, was a national of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This case concernedhis refusal to remove his skullcap while giving evidence before a criminal court which was examining acase about the attack on the US embassy in Sarajevo in 2011. This attack was committed by a member ofa local group advocating the Wahhabi/Salafi version of Islam who opposed the concept of secular stateand recognised only Allah’s judgment. In this criminal trial, all of the three defendants showed wilfuldisrespect for the authority of the court.* PhD candidate and Part-time tutor at Durham Law School, Durham University.1Hamidovic v Bosnia and Herzegovina (App. No.57792/15), judgment of 5 December 2017.[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors614In September 2012, Mr Hamidovic, who also belonged to the same Wahhabi/Salafi community, wassummoned to testify as a witness during the criminal trial. He appeared, as summoned, but refused toremove his skullcap, despite an order of the president of the trial chamber to do so. The judge explainedthat wearing a skullcap was contrary to the dress code for judicial institutions and that no religious symbolsor clothing were permitted in court under r.20 of the House Rules of the Judicial Institutions of Bosniaand Herzegovina. However, Mr Hamidovic maintained that “it was his religious duty to wear a skullcapat all times”2 as the prophet Muhammad had also worn one.3 The presiding judge then expelled him fromthe courtroom, convicted him of contempt of court and sentenced him to a fine of 10,000 convertiblemarks (BAM). In October 2012, an appeal chamber of the same court reduced the fine to BAM 3,000,but upheld the remainder of the first-instance decision holding that “the requirement to remove any andall headgear on the premises of public institutions was one of the basic requirements of life in society”4and “that in a secular State such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, any manifestation of religion in a courtroomwas forbidden”.5 He failed to pay the fine and as a consequence the fine was subsequently converted into30 days’ imprisonment. Mr Hamidovic duly served the prison sentence. In 2015, the Constitutional Courtof Bosnia and Herzegovina fully endorsed the reasoning of the domestic courts, finding in particular thatfining Mr Hamidovic for contempt of court had been lawful and did not breach his right to manifest hisreligion within the meaning of art.9 of the Convention.Mr Hamidovic then decided to bring a claim against the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina beforethe Strasbourg Court. He complained that punishment for refusing to remove his skullcap while givingevidence during the criminal trial infringed his rights under art.9 (right to freedom of religion) and art.14(prohibition of discrimination) of the ECHR.Findings of the Strasbourg CourtThe Strasbourg Court accepted that punishing Mr Hamidovic for wearing a skullcap in the courtroomconstituted a limitation on his right to manifest religion or belief within the meaning of art.9 of the ECHR.6It took the view that, although the wearing of the skullcap did not constitute a strong religious obligation,its firm rooting in tradition led many people in Bosnia and Herzegovina to consider it as such.7 As towhether the sanction imposed on him was “prescribed by law”, the Strasbourg Court opined that “[t]heCourt has no strong reasons to depart from the finding of the Constitutional Court”, and therefore theStrasbourg Court concluded that, “there was a legal basis in law for restricting the wearing of the skullcapin the courtroom”.8 With regard to whether there was a “legitimate aim”, it held that “an aim to upholdsecular and democratic values can be linked to the legitimate aim of the ‘protection of the rights andfreedoms of others’ within the meaning of art.9(2)”.9 As to whether the interference was “necessary in ademocratic society”, the Strasbourg Court found that there was “no reason to doubt that the applicant’sact was inspired by his sincere religious belief that he must wear a skullcap at all times, without any hiddenagenda to make a mockery of the trial, incite others to reject secular and democratic values or cause adisturbance”.10 His punishment only for refusing to take off his skullcap was therefore unnecessary in ademocratic society11 and the national authorities overstepped the wide margin of appreciation afforded to2Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [37].3Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [28].4Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [8].5Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [8].6Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [30].7Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [30].8Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [33].9Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [35].10Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [41].11Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [42].Case Analysis 615[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsthem.12 The Strasbourg Court held, by six votes to one, that there had been a violation of Mr Hamidovic’sright to freedom of religion under art.9 of the Convention. Having found an infringement of art.9, theStrasbourg Court decided not to examine the complaint from the viewpoint of art.14 of the ECHR. It isworth noting that two judges (Vincent A. De Gaetano and Marko Bosnjak) filed concurring opinions andone judge (Carlo Ranzoni) gave a dissenting opinion in Hamidovic.The reasoning of the majority: a critical analysisIt is argued that the Strasbourg Court’s ruling inHamidovic is admirable from the perspective of minority’sreligious freedom. The Strasbourg Court, for the first time, has accepted that in order to count as a religiousmanifestation within the meaning of art.9, a religious practice, namely the wearing of a skullcap in thiscase, need not be a strong religious duty. It would suffice to show that the religious practice in questionhas such “strong traditional roots that it is considered by many people to constitute a religious duty”.13Indeed, as the European societies continue to become increasingly multicultural and diverse, there is adegree of disagreement on whether certain controversial religious practices such as veiling by Muslimwomen, wearing turbans by Sikhmen, male circumcision, and ritual slaughter are mandatory or voluntary.Since the Strasbourg Court has taken a generous approach inHamidovic by stating that a religious practiceneed not be a strong religious duty, one may argue that many religious practices, which are not widelyrecognised as a compulsory religious obligation, will still qualify for protection within the meaning ofart.9 of the Convention.It is unclear why the presiding judge of Bosnia and Herzegovina required Mr Hamidovic to remove hisskullcap in the courtroom during the criminal trial. In the context of judicial institutions, judicial officialssuch as judges, prosecutors and court officers were prohibited fromwearing symbols of religious affiliationin the course of their duties. However, such dress code was not applicable to witnesses and parties.14 TheStrasbourg Court correctly characterised Mr Hamidovic as a “private citizen”15 and took the view that hewas not under an obligation to wear dress in a specific manner in court premises. Arguably, as a privatecitizen (as opposed to a public official or judicial officer) he had the right to dress as he deemed appropriate.As such, Mr Hamidovic did not owe a duty of neutrality and impartiality unlike the court officials.Therefore, the Strasbourg Court concluded that punishment for refusing to remove his skullcap in thecourtroom amounted to a disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of religion.In Hamidovic, the applicant was punished by the domestic courts simply because he chose to manifesthis religion through the wearing of a skullcap which, in his view, must be worn at all times. As far as thecriminal trial is concerned in which Mr Hamidovic was a witness, there is nothing to suggest that he wasdisrespectful towards the court or the judge. He appeared as summoned and stood up while addressingthe court, thereby clearly submitting to the laws and courts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He did not useany offensive language during the course of the trial. Indeed, the presiding judge was responsible tomaintain order and to ensure the integrity of the trial in which Mr Hamidovic was a witness. However,he completely failed to describe how Mr Hamidovic’s behaviour prevented the proper functioning of thecourt. Judge Bosnjak observed that the trial judge did not give “any valid reason” for prohibiting thewearing of a skullcap in the courtroom.16 As Judge De Gaetano put it in his concurring opinion:“[i]t is difficult to conceive how the applicant’s behaviour, in merely keeping his skullcap on as amanifestation of his deeply held religious belief, can be regarded as being either disrespectful towardsthe court or as engendering disorder or a lack of decorum in the courtroom. If the applicant had been12Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [43].13Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [30].14Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [14].15Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [40].16Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) Concurring Opinion of Judge Bosnjak at [6].616 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsa Catholic bishop, would he have been prevented from appearing in court wearing the pectoral cross?Or if he had been an Orthodox bishop, would he have been compelled to remove the blackheaddress?”17It is argued that this statement can be an important quotation for the Strasbourg Court in future toexamine whether a ban on wearing religious symbols or clothing by religious minorities infringes art.9of the ECHR.There is no doubt that, unlike Mr Hamidovic, the members of the same religious group to which hebelonged had shown a degree of disrespectful behaviour during the trial. It is clear from the backgroundof the case that the defendants of the criminal trial disrespected the trial judge by refusing to stand up, bystating that they would not “take part in rituals acknowledging man-made judgement”,18 by failing toexplain why they were wearing a skullcap, by refusing to enter into the courtroom on some occasions,and most importantly, by publicly stating that they had no intention of showing any respect for the courtwhich they did not recognise.19 However, Mr Hamidovic’s behaviour “differed considerably”20 from thedefendants: he only refused to remove his skullcap on account of his genuinely held belief that it was hisreligious duty to wear a skullcap at all times. One can argue that the presiding judge of the criminal trialwas influenced to take a harsh decision against the applicant by fining him because of the disrespectfulbehaviour of other members of the Wahhabi/Salafist group. As Judge Bosnjak put it in his concurringopinion, “the judge’s decision was motivated more by those other overt signs of disrespect than by theapplicant’s own behaviour”.21 If we accept the principles of human rights law, then we must acknowledgethat, in a free and liberal democratic society, one is responsible only for his own action or inaction, hemust not be punished for the conduct of other members of the group to which he belongs. In this sense,the Strasbourg Court’s finding—the imposition of punishment on Mr Hamidovic on the sole ground ofhis refusal to take off his skullcap was disproportionate—is absolutely correct and admirable.Indeed, it is hard to argue that the wearing of a skullcap by the applicant in itself undermined the orderin the courtroom or caused harm to the court proceedings or impaired the neutrality of the court. If a courtwants to maintain its impartial and neutral image, then the judges and other court officials should/canremove their religious symbols if they wear any. The wearing of religious clothing by a witness may notimpede a court’s reputation as a neutral state organisation. Rather, the expulsion from the courtroom andsubsequent punishment on a practising Muslim for wearing religious headgear during the proceedingsmight have the effect of undermining the court’s reputation as a neutral arbitrator. Therefore, taking intoaccount “the overall context at the time of the trial”22 in the criminal court, the majority held inHamidovicthat:[u]nlike some other members of his religious group, the applicant appeared before the court assummoned and stood up when requested, thereby clearly submitting to the laws and courts of thecountry. There is no indication that the applicant was not willing to testify or that he had a disrespectfulattitude. In these circumstances, his punishment for contempt of court on the sole ground of his refusalto remove his skullcap was not necessary in a democratic society.”23It can be argued that the Strasbourg Court should/could have addressed two particular matters inHamidovic. First, the majority could have concluded that Mr Hamidovic’s refusal to remove the skullcapin the courtroom was a conscientiously based objection. His refusal to take off the headgear derived from17Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) Concurring Opinion of Judge De Gaetano at [2].18Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [6].19Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [6].20Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) Concurring Opinion of Judge Bosnjak at [5].21Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) Concurring Opinion of Judge Bosnjak at [5].22Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [39].23Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [42].Case Analysis 617[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorshis genuinely held religious belief that he must wear a skullcap at all times.When the trial court summonedhim to give evidence, he had no choice but to appear before the court; a failure to do so would have exposedhim to a risk of punishment under the Criminal Code of Bosnia andHerzegovina. In this sense, the summonsof the court in relation to the criminal proceedings had the effect of putting him in a dilemma: either giveevidence by wearing the headgear and avoid criminal sanctions or refuse to appear before the court andface criminal sanctions. He had chosen the first option. Therefore, it is submitted that his objection to takeoff his skullcap while giving evidence in the criminal court could have been regarded by the majority asconscientious objection.24 In this context it is worth noting that the United Nations Human RightsCommittee, a body that monitors the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and PoliticalRights (hereinafter the Covenant), has stated that criminal prosecution and subsequent conviction forrefusing to perform compulsory military service contravenes art.18 (right to freedom of religion) of theCovenant because the “right to conscientious objection to military service inheres in the right to freedomof thought, conscience and religion”25 within the meaning of this article. It also held that the right toconscientious objection “entitles [an] individual to an exemption from compulsory military service if thiscannot be reconciled with that individual’s religion or beliefs”.26Onemay correctly argue that the majorityshould have transported this line of reasoning in Hamidovic.Secondly, in Hamidovic, the Strasbourg Court did not comment on the government’s submission thatby imposing punishment on the applicant “the trial judge had simply enforced a generally accepted ruleof civility”27 or the appeal chamber’s findings that “the requirement to remove any and all headgear onthe premises of public institutions was one of the basic requirements of life in society”.28 One can arguethat the Strasbourg Court technically refrained from commenting on this in the present case because theypreviously upheld the French criminal ban on wearing Islamic full-face veils in SAS v France on theground that covering one’s face in public spaces by wearing a full-face veil “falls short of the minimumrequirement of civility”.29 The SAS v France ruling caught huge media attention and many academicscholars criticised the Strasbourg Court’s reasoning.30 One can also argue that, in order to avoid suchcriticism again, in Hamidovic the Strasbourg Court intentionally did not answer how the wearing of askullcap, which covers only part of the hair but leaves the face, neck, and forehead completely visible,contravenes the basic requirements of life in society. The SAS v France ruling is problematic because therestrictions on the right to manifest one’s religion cannot and should not be based on behavioural norms(e.g. face-to-face communication, bareheaded appearance) of the society. This is because the right tofreedom of religion, guaranteed in art.9 of the Convention, is a “precious asset” for everyone and “one ofthe foundations of a ‘democratic society’ within the meaning of the Convention”.31 It is submitted that, inHamidovic, the Strasbourg Court had an opportunity to change its previous stance as to the effect of24Although this point was omitted by the majority of the judges, in giving his Concurring Opinion Judge Bosnjak stated, “[w]hile it is true that theapplicant disobeyed the order to remove the skullcap, this disobedience can be considered similar to conduct motivated by conscientious objection andcannot in itself be considered as a sign of contempt of court” (Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) Concurring Opinion of Judge Bosnjak at [6]).25Shadurdy Uchetov v Turkmenistan, Communication No.2226/2012, UNDoc.CCPR/C/117/D/2226/2012 (2016) at [7.6];Min-Kyu Jeong v Republicof Korea, Communication Nos 1642–1741/2007, UN Doc.CCPR/C/101/D/1642–1741/2007 (2011) at [7.3]; Akmurad Nurjanov v Turkmenistan,Communication No.2225/2012, UN Doc.CCPR/C/117/D/2225/2012 (2016) at [9.3].26Shadurdy Uchetov v Turkmenistan, Communication No.2226/2012, UNDoc.CCPR/C/117/D/2226/2012 (2016) at [7.6];Min-Kyu Jeong v Republicof Korea, Communication Nos 1642–1741/2007, UN Doc.CCPR/C/101/D/1642–1741/2007 (2011) at [7.3]; Akmurad Nurjanov v Turkmenistan,Communication No.2225/2012, UN Doc.CCPR/C/117/D/2225/2012 (2016) at [9.3].27Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [29].28Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) at [8].29 SAS v France (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 11 at [141].30 See, e.g. S.

Before Hamidovic, the only case where they found a violation of art.9 as to theprohibition on wearing Islamic dress was Ahmet Arslan v Turkey32: all other complaints were either declaredinadmissible or unsuccessful. In Hamidovic, the Strasbourg Court confirmed that Member States do nothave unlimited discretion to impose a ban or restriction on minorities’ religious practice arbitrarily andindiscriminately. Religious minorities across Europe, and Muslim minorities in particular, will welcomethe Strasbourg Court’s ruling in Hamidovic because this case sent a clear and straightforward message toall European countries that restrictions on wearing religious symbols and clothing can only be imposedwhen such religious practice causes harm to the state and/or others. Indeed, a liberal state must not interferewith the actions of an individual until his conduct causes harm. John Stuart Mill, in his famous essayentitled “On Liberty”, stated that “the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over anymember of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others”.33Judge Ranzoni’s dissentsAs mentioned above, Judge Ranzoni expressed a dissenting opinion in Hamidovic. He disagreed with themajority decision. In his view, there was no violation of art.9 in this case because “national courts, whichwere afforded a wide margin of appreciation, made a careful and comprehensible assessment based onthe particular circumstances of the present case”34 and “struck a fair balance between the requirements ofthe protection of the applicant’s freedom of religion and the legitimate aim of protecting the rights andfreedoms of others”.35 It is argued that there are at least two reasons why his dissenting opinion isproblematic in this case. These reasons are outlined below.First, Judge Ranzoni’s explanation as to the doctrine of margin of appreciation is questionable. He said:“the Court should not, primarily, examine the applicant’s situation and the facts of the case as such,but rather it should review the assessment made by the national courts. If this assessment was carriedout by independent and impartial domestic courts on the basis of the Court’s principles, taking dueaccount of the particular circumstances of the case and the competing interests, and if the nationalcourts’ decision, as a comprehensible result of this assessment, remained within the margin ofappreciation afforded to member States under the respective Convention right, then their decisionmust be accepted by our Court.”36It is submitted that there are some worrying features in this statement. The Strasbourg Court can onlyeffectively carry out the proportionality analysis under art.9(2) when it seriously considers the situationof the complainant and the facts and surrounding circumstances of the case. How is it possible for theStrasbourg Court to examine whether the impugned measure is necessary in a democratic society withoutconsidering these matters? How is it possible for it to assess whether the state overstepped the margin ofappreciation without taking into account these matters? Judge Ranzoni’s dissent opinion does not answerthese questions.32Ahmet Arslan v Turkey (App. No.41135/98), judgment of 23 February 2010. In this case, the applicants complained that they had been convictedunder criminal law for manifesting their religion through their distinctive clothing. The Strasbourg Court acknowledged that Turkey had not producedevidence that the applicants represented a threat to public security or public order through the wearing of religious dress which, in addition, did notjeopardise the identification of persons. The Strasbourg Court concluded that the conviction was not necessary for the protection of public safety andorder. Therefore, a violation of art.9 was established.33 J.S. Mill, On Liberty (first published 1859, Kitchener: Batoche Books, 2001), p.13.34Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15), Dissenting Opinion of Judge Ranzoni at [37].35Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15), Dissenting Opinion of Judge Ranzoni at [37].36Hamidovic (App. No.57792/15) Dissenting Opinion of Judge Ranzoni at [14].Case Analysis 619[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsThe second reason for which Judge Ranzoni’s dissents can be criticised is his explanation as to the roleof the national courts. He stated, “judicial institutions, owing to the separation of religion from public lifein the secular State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, had an obligation to support the values that brought peoplecloser, and not those which separated them, and that the temporary restriction in this case had aspired toachieve this aim”.37 A question arises how preventing an individual, who is wearing a religious symbol,from entering the courtroom would bring people closer? It is argued that bans or restriction on wearingsymbols of religious affiliation will exacerbate the polarisation between different communities and increasesocietal divisions. It is also arguable that if the courts exclude religious symbol wearing devout Muslimsfrom the courtroom in order to protect secularism, then the courts’ reputation as an impartial body willbe at stake. Therefore, one may correctly come to the conclusion that the reasoning of Judge Ranzoni inthe present case is unconvincing.Concluding remarksIn Hamidovic, the Strasbourg Court held that domestic courts of Bosnia and Herzegovina violated theright to freedom of religion under art.9 of the Convention when it punished a Muslim man for refusing toremove a skullcap while giving evidence in a criminal trial. In light of the majority’s finding that his art.9rights were infringed, one can argue that its ruling in this case has sent a message to religious minoritiesthat they are welcome in judicial institutions with their headgear on, and that they will not be arbitrarilypunished for wearing a dress or symbol of religious affiliation if they enter the court premises. In previouslandmark cases, such as SAS v France38 and Leyla Sahin v Turkey,39 concerning bans on wearing religiousdress by devoutMuslimwomen, the Strasbourg Court affordedwidemargin of appreciation to the domesticauthorities in assessing whether and to what extent restrictions on wearing Islamic dress is necessary, andthus in all40 (except the previously-cited Ahmet Arslan) cases, no infringement of art.9 was found.Concerning the art.9 right, Leigh and Hambler note:“[i]f states are permitted a wide margin of appreciation, both in determining the means of protectingConvention rights and in balancing them the net result … will be that the minimum protectionguaranteed by the Convention to persons claiming conflicting rights will be severely diminished andthe Strasbourg Court will be failing in its task of ensuring minimal supervision.”41The majority’s conclusion in the present case that the national authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovinahad “exceeded the wide margin of appreciation afforded to them”42 is a positive assertion, because theStrasbourg Court has now affirmed that it will override the domestic authority’s decision if and when theyoverstep the margin. Therefore, it is argued that the majority’s ruling inHamidovic is very significant andrepresents a potentially important development in the approach of the Strasbourg Court to art.9. It is hopedthat, afterHamidovic, the Strasbourg Court will be more prepared to find a violation of art.9 of the ECHRif and when a state prohibits the wearing of religious dress and symbols without any compelling reasons.37Hamidovic v egovina (App. No.57792/15) Dissenting Opinion of Judge Ranzoni at [20].38 SAS v France (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 11.39Leyla Sahin v Turkey (2007) 44 E.H.R.R. 5. In this case, the applicant Ms Sahin was a medical student of Istanbul University. The Vice-Chancellorof the University issued a circular which stated that the students who wore the Islamic headscarf must not be admitted to lectures, courses or tutorials.Ms Sahin, a practising Muslim and hijab-wearing woman, had been denied access to a written examination, refused enrolment for a course, refusedadmission to a lecture and, finally, refused entrance to a further written examination. Relying on art.9, she submitted that the ban on wearing theheadscarf constituted an unjustified interference with her right to freedom of religion, in particular her right to manifest her religion. The GrandChamber, in upholding the ban on the wearing of headscarves, stated that the headscarf was “imposed on women by a religious precept that was hardto reconcile with the principle of gender equality”. Accordingly, they held that there was no violation of art.9 in this case.40These cases include El Morsli v France (App. No.15585/06), decision of 4 March 2008; Kurtulmas v Turkey (App. No.65500/01), decision of 24January 2006; Kose v Turkey (App. No.26625/02), decision of 24 January 2006; Dahlab v Switzerland (App. No.42393/98) decision of 15 February2001; Ebrahimian v France (App. No.64846/11), judgment of 26 November 2015; Barik Edidi v Spain (App. No.21780/13), decision of 26 April 2016;Belcacemi and Oussar v Belgium (App. No.37798/13), judgment of 11 July 2017.41 I.

The Koptevskiy District Court, however, considered the books extremistmaterial. The decision of the court relied on a report from a panel of experts consisting of a philologist,a linguist psychologist, a social psychologist and a psychologist. In their report, the experts, among otherconcerns, concluded that the texts “encouraged religious discord between believers and non-believers”.The applicants argued that the experts who drafted the report were not well-placed to comment on thetexts in question and provided their own expert opinions by a panel consisting of a Doctor of Theologyand a Doctor of Religious Philosophy. These opinions were rejected by the court who argued that onlythe experts appointed by the court were competent to establish the meaning of the contested texts. Onappeal, the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of the Koptevskiy District Court declaring that thedecision had been “been lawful, well-reasoned and justified.” The second application (No. 28621/11)[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors622concerned the “The Tenth Word: The Resurrection and the Hereafter”, a book from the Risale-I NurCollection by Said Nursi, and an application to the Zhelezhnodorozhniy District Court of Krasnoyarsk toconfiscate the books and to declare them extremist material. The prosecutor relied on previous judicialdecisions and a report, published on 24 December 2008, by a philologist, a psychologist and a Doctor ofPhilosophy in Religious Studies who argued that “[t]he book substantiates and justifies extremist activity.”The applicants challenged the report leading the District Court to appoint its own panel of experts consistingof two psychologists and a Doctor of Philosophy in Religious Studies from the LomonosovMoscow StateUniversity. The report produced by the appointed experts concluded that “[t]he book does not contain anystatements, appeals or declarations which could be definitely interpreted as incitement of social, racial,ethnic or religious discord…” among other supportive statements. Nevertheless, on 21 September 2010,the Zhelezhnodorozhniy District Court of Krasnoyarsk granted the prosecutor’s application, declared thebook extremist and ordered the destruction of printed copies. In doing so, they rejected the report of theexperts they appointed as not credible, and instead relied on the report from December 2008. On 29November 2010, the Krasnoyarsk Regional Court rejected an appeal lodged by the applicants.The applicants complained before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that their right tofreedom of religion and freedom of expression had been violated because of the ban on publishing anddistributing the books.Held(1) The applications were joined and declared admissible (unanimous).When considering the admissibility of the applications, the Court rejected a claim by therespondent State that the application should be rejected under art.17 of the Convention. Atthe beginning of their assessment, the Court noted that the applications had been broughtunder both arts 9 and 10 of the Convention, with the Court declaring that in light of the factsof the case it will examine the present case under art.10, interpreted where appropriate inthe light of art.9.(2) The complaints concerning the ban on publishing and distributing Islamic books weredeclared admissible and the remainder of application No. 1413/08 inadmissible (unanimous).(3) There had been a violation of art.10 (unanimous).Neither party contested that the respondent state’s actions had constituted an interferencewith the applicants’ right to expression under art.10, resulting in the Court seeking todetermine whether the interference was prescribed by law, pursued one or more legitimateaims and was necessary in a democratic society. In assessing whether the interference wasprescribed by law, the Court reiterated that this means the measure should be based ondomestic law as well as be accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to itseffects. The foreseeability of a measure’s effects needs not be with absolutely certainty, butit should enable people to reasonably foresee the consequences which an act may entail. Inthe present case, the applicants challenged the precision and foreseeability of the domesticlegislation’s definition of “extremist activity”. The Court noted that the Venice Commissionhad considered the definition of “extremist activity” as “too broad, lacking clarity and opento different interpretations”. Nevertheless, the Court considered that the applicants’ grievanceswere more appropriately examined with regards to the proportionality of the interference.The Court therefore decided to leave open the question as to whether the interference wasprescribed by law.With regards to the legitimate aim the measures of the respondent state sought to achieve,the Court agreed to go along with Russia’s submission that they pursued the legitimate aimsof preventing disorder and protecting territorial integrity, public safety and the rights ofCase and Comment 623[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsothers. Subsequently, the Court sought to examine whether the measures would be considerednecessary in a democratic society, with this being examined both under freedom of religionand freedom of expression. When examining the general principles of freedom of religion,the Court noted that it encapsulates “freedom to hold or not to hold religious beliefs and topractise or not to practise a religion” as well as implying the freedom to manifest one’sreligion. States must act with neutrality and impartiality in ensuring the exercise of variousreligions, faiths and beliefs; but any attempts to assess the legitimacy of these beliefs orexpressions of belief are incompatible with this duty. As a result, the Court asserted that“the role of the authorities in such circumstances is not to remove the cause of tension byeliminating pluralism, but to ensure that the competing groups tolerate each other.” Withregards to freedom of expression, the Court recognised that states have a margin ofappreciation when seeking to regulate religious expression as in the present application.However, states must be able to show that such regulation corresponds to a pressing socialneed and that it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. When assessingproportionality, the Court recognised that the interference must be seen as necessary in thespecific circumstances. The relevant issue is therefore whether the contested statementscould, when read as a whole and in their context, be seen as a call for violence, hatred orintolerance. In applying these principles to the present case, the Court noted that, as a resultof the respondent state’s act of banning the publication and distribution of Said Nursi’sbooks, its examination should concern whether the banning was compatible with freedomof expression. Consequently, they aimed to examine whether the domestic courts had relevantand sufficient reasons for banning the books, which were acknowledged as having beenwidely published in many countries and had seemingly never before caused any interreligioustensions.In assessing application No.1413/08, the Court found that the decision of the domestic courtswas deficient because they failed to meaningfully assess the experts’ report; to conduct theirown analysis of the texts; and to consider the impact of their judgment on the applicants’rights under arts 9 and 10. It was also recognised that in rejecting evidence presented by theapplicants in defence of the texts, the courts had hindered the applicants’ ability to supporttheir position. Finally, as they failed to determine which parts of the texts they considered“extremist”, the decision prohibited the publishers from re-publishing an edited version ofthe books which amounted to an absolute ban on the texts.The Court also analysed application No. 28621/11 and found that the decision of the domesticcourts in that case suffered from the same deficiencies as the other application, although theCourt noted that the domestic courts were more specific with certain quotes from the textswhich they believed contained extremist language. In assessing whether the texts did containhate speech, the Court reiterated that it depends on whether, when read as a whole and intheir context, the texts can be seen as a call for violence, hatred or intolerance. The Courtnoted that the domestic courts had failed to consider the religious context of the texts. TheCourt finally rejected the concerns expressed by the domestic courts regarding the intent ofthe texts to influence readers into adopting the author’s ideology, with the Court recognisingthat it has previously accepted proselytism and that the intent of the texts was insufficientto justify banning the books. As a result, the Court held the domestic courts had not provided“relevant and sufficient” reasons for the interferences and had failed to justify why the bookswould incite violence, religious hatred or intolerance.(4) The respondent state was ordered to pay EUR 7,500 in respect of costs and expenses.(5) The remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction was dismissed.624 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCases ConsideredAydin Tatlav v Turkey (App. No.50692/99), judgment of 2 May 2006Castells v Spain (1992) 14 E.H.R.R. 445Delfi AS v Estonia [GC] (2016) 62 E.H.R.R. 6Editions Plon v France (2006) 42 E.H.R.R. 36Kokkinakis v Greece (1994) 17 E.H.R.R. 397Maestri v Italy [GC] (2004) 39 E.H.R.R. 38Murphy v Ireland (2004) 38 E.H.R.R. 13Perinçek v Switzerland [GC] (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 6S.A.S. v France [GC] (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 11Serif v Greece (2001) 31 E.H.R.R. 20CommentaryThis case is of particular importance for a number of reasons. First, the case firmly reiterated that it mustbe shown that an expression can “when read as a whole and in their context, be seen as a call for violence,hatred or intolerance” for such an expression to be deemed “hate speech”. In this regard, the Courtrecognised that even though the speech in questionmay “be perceived as offensive or insulting by particularindividuals or groups”, domestic courts cannot regulate such speech through hate speech legislation withoutthese specific criteria. Second, when domestic courts attempt to regulate such speech, it must be shownnot only that they considered expert reports submitted in defence of and against the material, but also thatthe judges fully engaged with the material in question. The case highlights that the failure of nationalauthorities and domestic courts to conduct a thorough examination of the material in question will leadthe Court to conclude the domestic procedures were deficient. The judgment also contained interestingassessments of monotheistic faiths noting and accepting that they would each claim “that it was betterthan the others” and making it clear that these characteristics could not themselves justify the regulationof materials or speech promoting religion through extremism legislation. The judgment is also an importantreminder that proselytism is protected under art.9 and only improper proselytism practices that attemptto convert people through the use of violence, brainwashing or taking advantage of those in distress or inneed could justify the regulation of such speech under art.10.Richard CostidellPussy RiotActivism—glass cages—courtroom—inhuman and degrading treatment—art.3—pre-trial detention—art.5—effective legal assistance—right to a fair trial—art.6—artistic and political expression—criminalsanctions—banning on online material—art.10Freedom of expression; Inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; Public order offences; Publicperformance; Religious premises; Remand; Right to fair trial; Right to liberty and security; Russia; SongsMariya Alekhina v Russia (Application No. 38004/12)European Court of Human Rights (Third Section): Judgment of 17 July 2018Case and Comment 625[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsFactsThe three applicants are members of a Russian feminist punk band, Pussy Riot. The applicants foundedPussy Riot in late 2011. The group carried out a series of impromptu performances of their songs in variouspublic areas in Moscow, such as a subway station, the roof of a tram, on top of a booth and in a shopwindow. They claimed that their performances were a response to the ongoing political process in Russia,to President Vladimir Putin’s participation in the 2012 elections and to the support he had from the RussianOrthodox Church. In October 2011, some of the members were arrested and fined for organising andholding an unauthorised assembly. On 21 February fivemembers of the band, including the three applicants,attempted to perform their songs at the Moscow’s Christ the Saviour Cathedral, but they were arrested bythe guards. The deputy director general of a private security company and the director of the Cathedral’sFund complained of a violation of public order by unidentified people. The police started an investigation,arrested the applicants and instituted criminal proceedings against them.The applicants complained that the transport to and from the Courts and their placement in glass cagesduring the trial proceedings violated their right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment underart.3. They also complained that there were no valid reasons to warrant remanding in custody in breachof art.5(3). They also complained that they could not effectively communicate with their lawyers duringthe trial which violated their right to a fair trial under art.6. Finally, they complained that their arrest andbanning of music material was in breach of art.10.Held(1) There had been a violation of art.3 (six votes to one).The Court noted that it had relied in previous cases on the European Committee for thePrevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“the CPT”),which has considered that individual compartments measuring 0.4, 0.5 or even 0.8 squaremetres are unsuitable for transporting a person, no matter how short the journey. In this case,the compartments were even smaller and thus allowed less than one sq. m per person whichmeant that the transport conditions were incompatible with art.3.The Court also noted that while glass cages are better than iron cages in which an individualmight feel intimated and humiliated, in this case the respondent state failed to prove that thecages were necessary for security reasons. The state had no reason to believe that theapplicants posed any threats and the cages were used to keep watching the applicants ratherthan monitoring the safety of the courtroom. The use of the cage was therefore humiliatingand intimating for the applicants and violated their art. 3 rights.(2) There had been a violation of art.5(3) (unanimous).The Court noted that between the time the applicants were arrested and the time they werebrought before a Court five months had elapsed. It had no difficulty in finding that thepre-trial detention was excessive and in breach of art.5(3). The Court cited earlier casesagainst Russia in which a violation had been found because the domestic courts alwaysjustify pre-trial detention, relying essentially on the gravity of the charges and usingstereotyped formulae without addressing a detainee’s specific situation or consideringalternative preventive measures.(3) There had been a violation of art.6(1) and (3)(c) (unanimous).The Court examined the complaints under art.6 together. They first started by analysing thecomplaints of the applicants under art.6(3)(c) that they were not able to consult their lawyersduring the trial. The Court reiterated the importance of the safety of a court room duringcriminal proceedings especially in public and sensitive cases. However, the Court agreed626 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorswith the applicants that the glass cage in which they had to sit throughout the proceedingsplaced a physical barrier between them and their lawyers which deprived them of their rightto receive effective legal assistance.(4) There was no need to examine the complaint under art.6(1) in view of the finding of aviolation of art.6(3)(c) (unanimous).(5) There had been a violation of art.10 on account of the applicants’ criminal prosecution (sixvotes to one).The Court reiterated its principles that the right to freedom of expression is one of theessential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progressand for each individual’s self-fulfillment, but it can be subjected to restrictions. In this case,the applicants’ rights to artistic and political expression was covered by art.10. Their arrestand institution of criminal proceedings also constituted a clear interference with theapplicants’ right. The Court paid due consideration to the fact that the applicants’ lastperformance took place at a cathedral and therefore this could offend others’ rights. However,the Court found that the criminal proceedings for hooliganism and incitement of hatred andreligious violence was groundless. Given the severity of criminal sanctions, the Courtconcluded that the interference with the applicants’ right to freedom of expression wasdisproportionate.(6) There had been a violation of art.10 in respect of the first and second applicants on accountof declaring the video material available on the Internet as extremist and banning it(unanimous).The Court had to examine whether the videos with the group’s performances owned andmade available online by the group were extremist under domestic legislation. Given thedisagreement regarding what could be considered extremist under the Russian legislation,the Court decided to leave the question open and examine whether the interference pursueda legitimate aim and was necessary in a democratic society. It was concluded that therestriction was aimed at serving morals and the rights of others. However, the Court wasnot convinced that an absolute ban on the material was necessary in a democratic society.(7) The respondent state had to pay EUR 16,000 (sixteen thousand euros) to the first and secondapplicants each and EUR 5,000 to the third applicant in respect of non-pecuniary damage(unanimous).(8) The remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction was dismissed (unanimous).Cases ConsideredIdalov v Russia [GC] (Application No.5826/03), judgment of 22 May 2012Khudoyorov v Russia (2007) 45 E.H.R.R. 5Mamedova v Russia (Application No.064/05), judgment of 1 June 2006Müller and Others v Switzerland (1991) 13 E.H.R.R. 212Oberschlick v Austria (no.2) (1998) 25 E.H.R.R. 357Pshevecherskiy v Russia (Application No.28957/02), judgment of 24 May 2007Sakhnovskiy v Russia [GC] (Application No.21272/03), judgment of 2 November 2010Seher Karataş v Turkey (Application No.33179/96), judgment of 9 July 2002Taranenko v Russia (Application no. 19554/05), judgment of 15 May 2014Van Mechelen and Others v the Netherlands (1997) 25 E.H.R.R. 647Case and Comment 627[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCommentaryThe case concerning the Pussy Riot activities has attracted wide media attention. The music andperformances of the band which included colorful clothes, balaclavas and lyrics aimed at criticisingVladimir Putin and the Russian Patriach were found to fall within the scope of art.10 as artistic and politicalexpression. The Court considered international standards and the importance of the right to freedom ofexpression as a cardinal right protected by the Convention and condemned Russia for imposing criminalsanctions on the applicants. The Court was also critical of the finding that the band’s performance couldincite hate and violence against a religious group. One regrettable outcome is that although the interpretationof the term ‘extremist’ under Russian law was raised twice before the Court, the latter decided not toengage with its meaning. Judge Elósegui, however, disagreed with themajority that the criminal prosecutionof the applicants was incompatible with art.10. The judge argued that while the applicants had a right toartistic and political expression, the means they used were disproportionate. She specifically referred tothe applicants’ efforts to perform at the altar of the cathedral. In her dissenting opinion, the judge emphasisedthat such a performance could make churchgoers and believers feel humiliated and intimidated. Sheconcluded that art.10 does not protect the invasion of churches and other religious buildings for politicalpurposes, nor does it protect conduct comprising intimidation and hostility against Christian Orthodoxbelievers. Judge Elósegui also disagreed with the majority on their conclusion that the placement of theapplicants in glass cages violated art.3. The judge accepted that the applicants might have felt exposed,however, she noted that the applicants were public figures and had repeatedly sought publicity by postingtheir performances online or inviting journalists to their performances. Following the invasion of the pitchduring the 2018 World Cup final in Moscow by the members of the band, which led to their arrest anddetention, and the alleged poisoning of one of them during their trial in Moscow, it will not be surprisingif another case reaches the Court regarding their activities and the criminal sanctions imposed by Russia.Sofia GalaniRight to privacy and social mediaSocial media—online platforms—defamatory comments—freedom of expression—right to reputation—art.8Compensatory damages; Costs; Defamation; Freedom of expression; Iceland; Reputation; Right torespect for private and family life; Social mediaEgill Einarsson v Iceland (No.2) (Application No.31221/15)European Court of Human Rights (Second Section): Judgment of 17 July 2018FactsThe applicant was a media personality who published, under pseudonyms, written pieces and had appearedon films and television. He was controversial in Iceland for his statements about women and sexual freedomand had been accused by some of claiming that some women should be subjected to sexual violence. In2011 and 2012, accusations of sexual offences were brought against the applicant. These were investigated628 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsby the police but were dismissed due to insufficient evidence. He then filed counter-claims against hisaccusers for falsely accusing him, but these were also dismissed.The applicant was interviewed by amagazine, in which he repeatedly denied the accusations and claimedhis accusers had ulterior motives and were part of a conspiracy. When the interview and the applicant’spicture were published on the front page of the magazine, there was a strong protest on a Facebook page.An individual (X) posted a comment stating: “This is also not an attack on a man for saying somethingwrong, but for raping a teenage girl … It is permissible to criticise the fact that rapists appear on the coverof publications which are distributed all over town…”. Xwas contacted by the applicant’s lawyer requestinga withdrawal, public apology and damages for defamation. X’s lawyer responded, informing the applicantthat the statement had been removed from Facebook, but submitting that the statements were not defamatory.The applicant then lodged defamation proceedings against X with the District Court.The District Court held that the statements by X were defamatory, and declared them null and void,but refused to award any further remedy, damages, or legal costs to the applicant. This damages assessmentwas based on the wide range of other comments available on the Facebook page, the relatively limitedreach of the statements in question, and the ambiguous position of the applicant with reference to sexualviolence based on his own published material. The applicant appealed, but the District Court’s judgmentwas upheld by the Supreme Court.The applicant complained before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that the failure ofthe domestic courts to grant him compensation and legal costs violated his right under art.8 of theConvention.Held(1) The Court declared the application admissible (unanimous).(2) There had been no violation of art.8 (unanimous).The applicant maintained that the Supreme Court’s decision not to grant him compensationviolated his art.8 right to privacy and family life, specifically his right to reputation, as hewas unable to defend himself if anyone called him a rapist in speech or writing. Headditionally claimed that he had not been granted an effective remedy to achieve theminimumprotection expected under art.8. TheGovernment contended that the domestic court’s decisionhad been within the margin of appreciation offered under art.8, and the declaration that theoffending statements were null and void was a sufficient legal remedy.The Court determined that there was sufficient margin of appreciation afforded to memberstates in their protection of reputation, which is protected under art.8, as long as the decisionnot to grant him compensation did not empty the right of its effective content. Theydetermined that the decision to declare the statements null and void was an effective andsufficient remedy based on the national courts’ analysis of the nature and gravity of the case.The decision not to grant the applicant his legal costs was also proportionate on the facts,given that the domestic courts did not accept all of the applicant’s claims.Cases consideredA v Norway (App. No.28070/06), judgment of 9 April 2009Airey v Ireland (1979) 2 E.H.R.R. 305Axel Springer AG v Germany (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 6Bédat v Switzerland (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 15Biriuk v Lithuania (App. No.23373/03), judgment of 25 November 2008Egill Einarsson v Iceland (App. No.24703/15), judgment of 7 November 2017Case and Comment 629[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsFrisk and Jensen v Denmark (App. No.19657/12), judgment of 5 December 2017MGN Limited v United Kingdom (2011) 53 E.H.R.R. 5Mertinas and Mertiniené v Lithuania (App. No.43759/09), judgment of 8 November 2016Petrie v Italy (App. No.25322/12), judgment of 18 May 2017Pfeifer v Austria (2007) 48 E.H.R.R. 175Sanchez Cardenas v Norway (2007) 49 E.H.R.R. 147CommentaryThis judgment represents a second application made by this applicant, stemming from responses to hisinterview in a magazine on social media, and his pursuit of defamation claims against those responding.In the facts of Egill Einarsson v Iceland (No.1), the Icelandic Supreme Court had held that the comment:‘Fuck you rapist bastard’ was a value judgment and therefore could not be considered defamatory. Thiswas held to be a violation of the applicant’s art.8 right to privacy. According to the Court, the context inwhich the comment was made at a time when the applicant was facing accusations of rape was particularlyrelevant. The statement that the applicant was a ‘rapist’ was in this case an imputation of objective andfactual nature, and therefore defamatory as the accusations had not been proven. This case showed a shiftin the Court’s jurisprudence in the balancing of the rights to privacy and the right to freedom of expressionon social media platforms.In this case, we see what could perhaps be considered a mitigation of the decision in No.1, reinforcingthat while these findings of defamation in online forums may still stand, the effective protection of theright to reputation under art.8 does not require states to impose compensation where the context does notrender this appropriate. However, this mitigating effect should not be overstated. Although this decisiondoes show a greater margin of appreciation offered to states in the protection of the right to reputationthan was found in the judgment of No.1, the effect on balancing of rights from No.1 does still stand andthe right was still notionally protected in this case.While largely uncontroversial, the case is a helpful guide for those who widely express their views onsocial media as well as for those who use these platforms to launch attacks and insulting comments seekingto hide behind anonymity of how the rights to privacy and freedom of expression are protected. In an erathat the use of online platforms has become part of our everyday life and its regulation remains ratherchallenging, the Court reiterated that while the rights to privacy and freedom of expression will be protectedunder the Convention, the states will enjoy a margin of appreciation to effectively balance these rights.Christopher GrayFreedom of expression and online blogsInternet forum—blogs—users’ comments—elections—police officers—insulting language—hate speech—criminal sanctions—freedom of expression—art.10Blogs; Elections; Freedom of expression; Hate speech; Police; Russia; Social mediaSavva Terentyev v Russia (Application No.10692/09)European Court of Human Rights (Third Section): Judgment of 28 August 2018630 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsFactsThe present case concerns an allegation made byMr Savva Sergeyevich Terentyev (the applicant), againstthe government of the Russian Federation (the Government) owing to the perceived infringement of hisright to freedom of expression in respect of a comment which was made by the applicant on an internetblog. The comment was about a police raid in the offices of a newspaper which had been openly supportiveof the opposition candidate in the 2007 regional elections. In raiding the office, the police declared thatthe software on the office computers were counterfeit and subsequently seized the hard disks. That sameday Mr I.S, who was also the President of a regional non-governmental organisation, published an onlineblog under which a comment was left byMr T which describe the “police” as the regime’s “faithful dogs”.On the same date Mr B.S, an acquaintance of the applicant, also published a blog in which he included ahyperlink to Mr I.S’s blog. The applicant followed this hyperlink and read the comment left by Mr T.Afterwards, the applicant returned to Mr I.S’s blog and left a comment wherein he disagreed with Mr Tand drew a distinction between the “police” and, as he described them, the “cops”. The latter, in his view,were “lowbrows and hoodlums” and he speculated about the desirability of having a large oven in thecentre of every Russian city where “cops” could be burnt like in Auschwitz.These comments led to criminal proceedings which began on 14 March 2007. In preparation for thepreliminary hearing, a report was published on 30 April 2007 which stated that the applicant had expresseda “distinctly negative opinion of “all police officers”. At the beginning of his trial, the applicant pleadednot guilty contending that he had drawn a distinction between a police officer and cop and argued that,although he was the author of the comment, it reflected his emotional and spontaneous reaction to thesituation of the day and had subsequently been removed from the blog. The court called for asocio-humanities forensic report which could examine the impact of the impugned statement. The reportconcluded that the applicant had targeted all police officers as a “social group” and had aimed at “incitinghatred and enmity” towards them whilst also calling for their physical extermination. On 7 July 2008, theapplicant was found guilty under art.282 (1) of the Russian Criminal Code for “having publicly committedactions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity and humiliating the dignity of a group of persons on thegrounds of their membership of a social group”. The court of first instance gave particular weight to thefact that the applicant had negatively influenced public opinion with the aim of inciting social hatred. Theapplicant appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic asserting that the term“social group” had been deliberately extended to encompass police officers and that his prosecution underthis provision were brought arbitrarily, given that many well-known figures had made similar statementsyet not faced prosecution. The Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s appeal.The applicant lodged a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) complainingthat the criminal sanctions against him violated his right to freedom of expression under art.10.Held(1) There had been a violation of art.10 (unanimous).The Court first dealt with the applicant’s assertion that the interference, which the partiesagreed had occurred, was not prescribed by law. The Court reiterated that it has consistentlyrecognised that domestic law must be of general application so as to allow it to adapt tochanging social circumstances. In line with this view, the Court opined that in any systemof law, regardless of how clearly drafted a provision may be, there will also be a need forinterpretation by the domestic courts. Importantly, the Court noted that the way in whichthe term “social group” was interpreted by the domestic courts did not conflict with thenatural meaning of those words. The Court therefore concluded that the interference withthe right to freedom of expression was prescribed by law. The Court also very quicklyCase and Comment 631[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsasserted that the requirement of a legitimate aim was met given that the prosecution inquestion was aimed at protecting the reputation and rights of the Russian police. In decidingwhether the infringement was necessary in a democratic society, the Court held that the term“necessary” implies that there must be a pressing social need and that although memberstates enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the necessity of an infringement,it is the Court which has the final say. The Court held that in exercising this “final say” itwas required to have regard to the situation as a whole and that it must determine whetherthe actions taken by the national authorities were proportionate and whether their reasonsfor doing so were relevant and sufficient. Crucially, the Court stated that, in situations wherespeech is being used to spread or incite violence, the state, as the guarantor of public order,is entitled to resort to criminal sanctions and that in the case of inciting or spreading ofviolence against public officials the margin of appreciation is even wider. In applying theseprinciples to the present case, the Court reasoned the applicant’s speech did incite hatredand violence and was not “merely insulting”. Further, the Court found that whilst the useof vulgar and insulting language is not in itself sufficient to cause that language to fall outsidethe protection of art.10, if that language amounts to wanton denigration it may fall outsidethe protecting scope of art.10. In addition, the Court considered and expressed severedisapproval at the references to Auschwitz and the Holocaust, but it did not find themsufficient on their own to justify interference with art.10. The main justification for theCourt’s approach was the time the comments were expressed just before the elections whenall the views should be circulated freely. The Court also found that the domestic courts didnot appear to have examined the comments in their whole context but rather had limitedtheir examination to the form and tenor of the speech. Due to this failing, the Court foundthat the reasons for interference could not be viewed as relevant and sufficient. Finally, theCourt found that the suspended sentence that was given to the applicant was of the mostsevere form which could be given and that this was excessive due to the finding that theimpugned statements were not sufficient to warrant such an interference.(2) The finding of a violation of art.10 constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for anynon-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant.(3) The respondent state was ordered to pay EUR 5,000 in respect of costs and expenses(unanimous).(4) The remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction was dismissed (unanimous).Cases ConsideredChristian Democratic People’s Party v Moldova (No. 2), (App. No.25196/04) judgment of 2 February2010Długołęcki v Poland (App. No.23806/03), judgment of 24 February 2009Dmitriyevskiy v Russia (App. No.42168/06), judgment of 29 May 2012Feldek v Slovakia (App. No. 29032/95), judgment of 12 July 2001Gorzelik and Others v Poland (2007) 44 E.H.R.R 47Gül and Others v Turkey (2011) 52 E.H.R.R. 38,Janowski v Poland (App. No.25716/94), judgment of 21 January 1999Karataş v Turkey (App. No. 23168/94), judgment of 16 January 2018Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v France (App. No.21279/02), judgment of 22 October 2007Magyar Helsinki Bizottság v Hungary (App. No. 18030/11), judgment of 8 November 2016Morice v France (2016) 62 E.H.R.R. 1Otegi Mondragon v Spain (2015) 60 E.H.R.R. 7632 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsÖztürk v Turkey (App. No. 22479/93), judgment of 9 June 2009Pentikäinen v Finland (2017) 65 E.H.R.R. 21Vejdeland and Others v Sweden (2014) 58 E.H.R.R. 15CommentaryThe present case is interesting due to how far the applicant was allowed to go in terms of hateful speechyet still find protection within art.10. The Court’s finding that, despite being seen as offensive, insultingand virulent, the applicant’s comments should still receive protection, signals a clear endorsement of theright to freedom of expression and the ability to speak one’s mind. However, it is worth flagging up atleast three criteria that the Court considered to reach this conclusion. The first had to do with the time thecomments were expressed. The Court has reaffirmed on a number of occasions that political speech isone of the highest forms of the freedom of expression. The fact therefore that the comments were expressedbefore the local elections played a defining role in the conclusion of the Court. The other criterion carefullyconsidered by the Court was that the comments were made against the police as a public institution anddid not target a minority or specific individuals, although there were references to Auschwitz, and as aresult this could not incite hate or violence against specific people. Finally, the Court did not approve ofthe criminal sanctions imposed on the applicant which considered the most serious interference with theright to freedom of expression.The case comes as part of a series of cases decided by the Court on the right of freedom of expressionon online platforms and hate speech (see also Egill Einarsson v Iceland (No.2) (Application No. 31221/15)and Ibragim Ibragimov and Others v Russia (Application Nos 1413/08 and 28621/11) in the same issue)which shows the difficulties in balancing the freedom of expression on social media and online platformswith the protection of the rights of others and the margin of appreciation states enjoy in these cases.Jordan OwenParenting testing and contact rightsBiological father—legal father—parenting testing—contact rights—child’s best interest—right to receiveinformation—right to family life—art.8Best interests; Children's welfare; Contact; Germany; Paternity; Right to respect for private and familylifeFröhlich v Germany (Application No.16112/15)European Court of Human Rights (Fifth Section): Judgment of 26 July 2018FactsIn 2004, the applicant began a relationship with X, a married woman who continued to live with herhusband, with whom she had six children. Two years later, X told the applicant that she was pregnant andin October 2006, she gave birth to a girl. Shortly after, the relationship with the applicant ended. X andher husband, the girl’s legal father, refused the applicant’s subsequent initiatives to have contact with thechild and did not consent to paternity testing. The applicant brought a complaint before the Family CourtCase and Comment 633[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsarguing that he is the child’s father and gave the court a sworn declaration that he had sexual intercoursewith the mother at the time of conception. The applicant appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal.The court orally heard evidence by the applicant, the child’s legal father and the mother. The father arguedthat he was aware of his wife’s relationship, but she had told him that this relationship ended in 2005.Both parents confirmed that all the children except the youngest one knew about the dispute with theapplicant and argued that it was not in the child’s best interests to find out about the situation. In 2012,the court appointed a legal guardian to the child who also confirmed that contact with the applicant wouldbe detrimental for the child. Despite the guardian’s objection, the child appeared before the court andconfirmed that although she did not know the reasons her parents had a dispute with the applicant, shedid not want to establish a contact with him. The Court of Appeal decided to reject the appeal. In itsjudgment, the court placed emphasis on the child’s best interests and explained that the child waswell-integrated in a family where she felt happy and secure. She was emotionally attached to her mother’shusband who was the only father she knew. Establishing therefore contact rights with the applicant wouldbreak up the family as a unit and have detrimental effects for the child. In 2014, the Federal ConstitutionalCourt rejected the applicant’s complaint as he had not provided any new reasons other than the onesalready submitted and examined by the Court of Appeal.The applicant complained before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that the failure ofthe domestic courts to establish contact with his daughter violated his right to private and family life underart.8. He also claimed that the failure of the domestic authorities to investigate his allegations aboutpaternity violated his art.8 right in conjunction with art.6.Held(1) The complaint about the refusal of contact rights in conjunction with art.6 was manifestlyill-founded and inadmissible (unanimous).With reference to the applicant’s complaint that the domestic courts’ decision to refuse himcontact with the child violated his rights under arts 8 and 6, the Court stated that this fallswithin the scope of art.8 alone. The Court considered that the Court of Appeal’s refusal togrant the applicant contact rights amounted to an interference at least with the applicant’sright to private life. The Court, however, found that the interference had a legal basis—thechild’s best interests; that the competent authorities had a wide margin of appreciation indeciding a child’ best interests; and that in this case the Court of Appeal had provided detailedreasons for why they believed that it was not in the child’s best interests to not allow contactrights. The Court also noted that the applicant was given numerous opportunities to be orallyheard by the domestic courts, to submit his own evidence and participate in all theproceedings. As a result, the Court did not agree with the applicant that the Court foundagainst him because they based their findings on standardised arguments in favour of socialfamilies.(2) There had been no violation of art.8 (unanimous).The Court repeated the same principles regarding the applicant’s complaint concerning therefusal to provide information about the child. It was noted that all parties accepted that theimpugned decision interfered with the applicant’s right to family life. The Court also tooknote of the importance a paternity test would have both for the applicant and the future ofthe child. This was particularly significant considering the legal father’s child doubt abouthim being the biological father. However, the Court could not object to the domestic court’sdecision that at least for the time being a paternity test or contact rights would not be in thechild’s best interests. The subsidiary role of the Court in these cases was also mentionedand it was concluded that the domestic courts had adduced sufficient reasons for their decision634 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorsto refuse the applicant information rights and provided the applicant with the requisiteprotection of his interests.Cases consideredAhrens v Germany (App. No.45071/09), judgment of 22 March 2012Anayo v Germany (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 5I.S. v Germany (App. No.31021/08), judgment of 5 June 2014Kautzor v Germany (App. No.23338/09), judgment of 22 March 2012Schneider v Germany (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 12CommentaryDespite the unfortunate set of circumstances of the case and the inability of the applicant to find outwhether he was the biological father, and if so to establish contact rights with the child, the case is a strongreminder that the right to family life of a parent is always balanced against a child’s best interests. TheCourt reiterated that the assessment of what is best for the child is to be conducted by the national competentauthorities and the Court only has a subsidiary role in reviewing the effectiveness of the assessment. Evenin this case that the domestic legislation could not enable a possible biological father to establish contactrights, because the legislation gives these rights only to biological fathers and persons who have assumedresponsibility for a child, the Court noted that the domestic courts took significant steps to decide whatwas best for the child by holding oral hearings, collecting expert reports, appointing a legal guardian andgiving the opportunity to the child to decide whether she wanted contact rights with the applicant. Onekey decisive criterion that emerges from the merits of the case regarding the protection of the right tofamily life of a parent is that the domestic courts noted that not offering to the applicant contact rightswas in the best interests of the child for the time being. This means that the applicant was not barred fromestablishing contact rights later on.Sofia GalaniIndependent investigationsUse of force—police—death—ill-treatment—effective and independent investigation—art.2—art.3Duty to undertake effective investigation; Impartiality; Inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;Police detention; Right to life; RussiaKhodyukevich v Russia (Application No.74282/11)European Court of Human Rights (Third Section): Judgment of 28 August 2018FactsIn September 2008, the applicant’s son, Mr Alchine, was arrested and taken to the police station after analtercation with his wife. On the same day, a few hours after being released, he was found unconsciousin the street. He was taken to the hospital and died eleven days later. The applicant alleged that her sonhad passed out after being hit on the head by the police officers during an altercation and they draggedCase and Comment 635[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorshis body in the street a few meters away from the police station. The police officers said that Mr Alchinewas drunk when he arrived at the police station, but no injury was visible on his body. A criminalinvestigation was opened by an investigator from the same police station for voluntary violence resultingin severe health damage. On the same day,Mr Alchine’s wife went to the police station where she confessedhaving caused physical harm to her husband. She then withdrew her statement. After Mr Alchine’s death,the Instruction Committee opened an investigation for voluntary violence causing unintentional death.An autopsy revealed that the death resulted from complications due to a head injury which had been causedby a hard object. The investigator suspended the investigation on the ground that the duty for theinvestigation had expired and that no witness had been identified. The applicant’s complaint against thedecision was dismissed.In March 2014, Mrs Alchine (the wife) went to the Instruction Committee and confessed to have hither husband. The investigation revealed that Mr and Mrs Alchine had a fight, during which Mrs Alchinehad struck her husband on the head with a rolling pin. The investigator found that Mrs Alchine hadexceeded the bounds of self-defence and ended the criminal proceedings. On the same day, the investigatordismissed the proceedings against the police officers and concluded that the offence had been committedby Mrs Alchine. He rejected the applicant’s claim that her son had been killed by the police officers dueto the fact that this claim solely relied on the applicant’s suspicion and the lack of evidence. The regionalcourt rejected the applicant’s appeal against the investigator’s decision to terminate the criminal proceedingsagainst Mrs Alchine in a final judgment. The applicant was awarded damages as a compensation for theexcessive length of the investigation. She did not contest this decision.The applicant brought a claim before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) alleging thatthe police officers had ill-treated her son while he was in the police station, which had resulted in his deathand a violation of arts 2 and 3.Held(1) The Court declared the complaint admissible (unanimous).(2) There had been no violation of the substantive limb of arts 2 and 3 (unanimous).The circumstances of the case did not allow the judges to establish that Mr Alchine wasbeaten by the police officers. According to witnesses, the applicant’s son was able to speakand communicate with others when he left the police station and did not show any physicalinjury. Moreover, the Court noted that it was the first time that the applicant raised theargument that the police officers left her son dying in front of the police station. Thus, thenational authorities had not been able to check the accuracy of this allegation and the Courtdid not have enough evidence to establish that the police officers inflicted ill-treatment onthe applicant’s son. It considered that the national authorities did not fail their substantiveobligation to protect Mr Alchine’s life.(3) There had been a violation of the procedural limb of arts 2 and 3 (unanimous).The judges reiterated that the right to life under art.2 in combination with art.1 required aneffective investigation into the use of force by state agents, especially in cases where thisforce resulted in someone’s death. This obligation also applies to art.3 and in cases in whichan individual alleges to have been the victim of ill-treatment in the hands of the police orother state agents. The applicant was notably suspicious regarding the independence of thefirst investigator who was from the same police station as the police officers suspected ofill-treatment. The Court found that the investigation should have been entrusted to an officerwho would not work in the same unit in order to preserve the litigants’ trust in thetransparency of the investigations and to exclude any suspicion of lack of independence.(4) There was no need to consider art.13 separately (unanimous).636 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors(5) The applicant’s complaint that her son’s detention was incompatible with art.5 was dismissedas ill-founded (unanimous).(6) The applicant’s claims for EUR 100,000 in damages was found excessive, but she wasawarded EUR 10,000 for the distress, frustration and feeling of injustice she had experienced.Cases consideredAl-Skeini and others v the United Kingdom (2011) 53 E.H.R.R. 18Armani Da Silva v the United Kingdom [GC] (2016) 63 E.H.R.R. 12Assenov and others v Bulgaria (1998) 28 E.H.R.R. 652Brecknell v The United Kingdom (2008) 46 E.H.R.R. 42Enoukidze and Guirgvliani v Georgia (App. No.25091/07), judgment of 26 April 2011Gambulatova v Russia (App. No.11237/10), judgment of 26 March 2015Giuliani and Gaggio v Italy [GC] (2012) 54 E.H.R.R. 10Ireziyevy v Russia (App. No.21135/09), judgment of 2 April 2015Kaya v Turkey (1998) 28 E.H.R.R. 1Lykova v Russia (App. No.68736/11), judgment of 22 December 2015McCann and others v The United-Kingdom (1995) 21 E.H.R.R. 97McKerr v The United Kingdom (2002) 34 E.H.R.R. 20Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç v Turkey (App. No.24014/05), judgment of 25 June 2013Ramsahai and others v The Netherlands [GC] (2008) 46 E.H.R.R. 43CommentaryThe unanimous conclusion of the judges in this case leaves no doubt as to the importance the Court attachesto the independence of an investigation into the ill-treatment and death of an individual. The Court reiteratedthe well-established principles regarding the procedural duties arising from arts 2 and 3, particularly incases in which the allegations are against the use of force employed by state agents. They also reinforcedtheir position that in spite of any investigative difficulties, such as lack of evidence, states remain undera duty to conduct an effective and independent investigation even if there is no conclusive outcome onthe cause of death. Although this case does not add much to the principles of the Court regarding theprocedural obligations of states under arts 2 and 3, it does show that even in cases where the applicantshave no evidence or witnesses to support their allegations or another person takes responsibility for thedeath of another individual, national authorities are not absolved from their duty to investigate the use offorce by the police.Lucie LaffontContact rights during divorce proceedingsContact rights—visiting rights—divorce—interim injunctions—lengthy proceedings—parents and childrelationship—right to family life—art.8Divorce; Family proceedings; Length of proceedings; Parental contact; Right to respect for privateand family life; RomaniaCase and Comment 637[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCristian Cătălin Ungureanu v Romania (Application No. 6221/14)European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section): Judgment of 4 September 2018FactsThe applicant in this case, Cristian Cătălin Ungureanu, was born in 1972, lives in Ploiesti and was at therelevant time married to I.M.U., with whom he had a son born in 2006. Following disputes between theparents concerning their son’s education, I.M.U. filed for divorce and custody of the child on 13 September2012. On 19 October 2012, she and the child left the family home and moved in with her parents.The applicant lodged an application for sole custody, shared custody or visiting rights (according to aspecific schedule) during the divorce proceedings with the Ploiesti District Court on 2 November 2012.On 8 January 2013, the District Court ruled that it would not be in the child’s best interest to changeresidence and that the applicant had not been prevented from visiting the child, noting that the law didnot provide for establishing visiting rights during divorce proceedings. The applicant appealed to thePrahova County Court, which on 27 May 2013 upheld the previous ruling. After the ruling of the CountyCourt, the applicant claims I.M.U and her family denied him any contact with the child.The Ploiesti District Court gave its judgment on the divorce proceedings on 22 January 2014 followingseveral postponements mostly due to the parties’ submission of additional evidence. The Court ruled thatthe child’s sole residence would be with his mother and that the applicant would have the child stay at hishome every other weekend and for two weeks during the summer. The applicant requested the Courtexpedite the drafting of the judgment as he had been unable to see his child for ten months.The judgment was served to the applicant on 4 March 2014, who subsequently lodged an appeal on 28March 2014. I.M.U also lodged an appeal in 2 April 2014. Due to administrative problems within theDistrict Court, the file would not be sent to the County Court before 7 May 2014, despite requests by theapplicant to expedite the proceedings in order to re-establish contact with his son. The County Courtdelivered its ruling on 22 October 2015, upholding the previous decision. At the request of the applicant,the file was sent to the Bucharest Court of Appeal, which delivered a decision on 2 November 2016,upholding the ruling with some changes to the visiting schedule. On 19 February 2017, the child movedin with the applicant in according to the child’s express request and in accordancewith a notarised agreementbetween the parents.The applicant complained before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that the inability tosecure visiting rights during the divorce proceedings and the unreasonable length of those proceedingshad resulted in a violation of art.8 and his right to family life causing psychological harm to the child anddamage to their relationship.Held(1) The Court declared the application admissible (unanimous).(2) There had been a violation of art.8 (unanimous).Noting that the domestic courts had stated that domestic law did not provide for the visitingrights during divorce proceedings, the Court acknowledges that following the decision of 8January 2013, it became increasingly difficult for the applicant to maintain a relationshipwith the child. The applicant’s complaint, therefore, relates to the effects of the law on therelationship with his son.While domestic courts do not always reject requests for visiting rights, the applicant couldnot have benefited from favourable case-law as it is not regarded as a primary source of law.The Court found the Government’s claim that applicant was not prevented from seeing hischild to be a mere observation of circumstances and not an effective examination of the638 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributorschild’s best interests, leaving the exercise of a crucial right at the discretion of I.M.U., withwhom the applicant was in conflict.Since the proceedings lasted over four years, and the relationship of the applicant and hischild affected for approximately three years and five months, the Court considers thelengthiness of the proceedings to show that the respondent state had failed to discharge itspositive obligations under art.8 of the Convention, owing to insufficient quality of domesticlaw.(3) The Court held that there is no need to examine separately whether there had been a violationof art.8 with respect to length of divorce proceedings (unanimous).(4) The respondent State was ordered to pay EUR 8,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damageand EUR 2,380 in respect of costs and expenses (unanimous).(5) The Court dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction (unanimous).Cases ConsideredCristescu v Romania (App. No. 13589/07), judgment of 10 January 2012Eberhard and M v Slovenia (App. Nos 8673/05 and 9733/05), judgment of 1 December 2009Jovanovic v Sweden (App. No. 10592/12), judgment of 22 October 2015M and M v Croatia (2017) 65 E.H.R.R. 9Mitrova and Savik v Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (App. No. 42534/09), judgment of 11February 2016Radomilja v Croatia [GC] (App. Nos 37685/10 and 22768/12), judgment of 20 March 2018CommentaryIn Cristian Cătălin Ungureanu v Romania, the main question was whether the domestic legislation hadan adverse impact on the relationship between the applicant and his son. The Court had no difficulty inaccepting that the relationship between a parent and their child falls within the protection of art.8. Ittherefore focused its analysis on whether the respondent state took the right steps to discharge its positiveobligations under art.8. The weaknesses of the domestic legislation, the lengthiness and uncertain resultsof the interim injunctions led the Court to conclude that the long time the applicant spent away from hisson in spite of his efforts to swiftly change the circumstances severely affected the relationship with thisson. The Court’s ruling serves to prompt legislative changes for the purpose of ensuring that family lifeis not unnecessarily harmed in divorce proceedings, thus ensuring they are carried out thoughtfully, withrespect for the circumstances at hand and with due urgency.Anthony MorelliConditions of detention in correctional facilitiesConditions of detention—correctional facilities—inmates—Malta—degrading and inhuman treatment—art.3Inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; Malta; Prison conditions; Right to effective remedyCase and Comment 639[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsAbdilla v Malta (Application No.36199/15)European Court of Human Rights (Fourth Section): Judgment of 17 July 2018FactsThe applicant Mr Jean Pierre Abdilla, who is a Maltese national born in 1975, was sentenced to 16 yearsimprisonment on 3 December 2009 for drug-related offences. During his imprisonment at the CorradinoCorrectional Facility in Paola, Malta, the applicant was detainedmostly in Division 2 of the facility, wherehe stayed in various cells, but he also spent two short periods in high security unit Division 6. After hissecond stint in Division 6, he was placed back in Division 2 in cell no.45 for 3 years and later in cell no.72.The applicant claimed the 200-year-old facility needs maintenance, lacks light and air, is squalid and hasa bad smell. Windows in the prison have two iron grids and a third layer of iron bars (triple-barred) andalthough Division 2 has three skylights, they are kept closed even during summer causing very hotconditions. While the applicant was placed in cell no.42 he suffered fumes and excessive heat pouringinto his inadequately ventilated cell from the bakery nearby. Mr Abdilla also described the cell as nearlyunderground and the triple-barred windows barely allowed him to see outside. He claimed that duringwinter the cell was cold and humid. When he was moved to cell no.70 in December 2014, the applicantfelt claustrophobic due to its small size and low ventilation, also claiming he had occasional access torunning water. The meals at the facility were small portions of poor quality, non-nutritious food preparedin an unhygienic kitchen. Mr Abdilla also alleges that dead mice were found in the kitchen and twoprisoners were taken to hospital due to food poisoning in September 2015. Inmates were forced to flushtoilets using a bucket of water as there were no flushing systems installed in the prison. Furthermore,access to running water was scarce in the facility with no in-cell access to water at times; inmates couldpurchase bottled water but were forced to reduce drinking water whenever they were low on cash. In termsof showering, hot water was dirty and scarcely available with one cracked shower tray which could leadto potential injury. For all Division 2 inmates Mr Abdilla alleged there was only one shower availablemost of the time with two showers available only over the summertime. The applicant also complainedthat telephone costs were too high and the prison allowance given to detainees was very little especiallyconsidering the tuck shop was unreasonably expensive. When Mr Abdilla suffered health issues and wasconfined to his bed, the emergency buzzer in his cell did not work and so it took 30 minutes for staff toarrive and assist him.The applicant complained before the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) that the conditionsof detention violated his right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment.Held(1) The applicant’s complaint under art.3 was declared admissible (unanimous). The complaintunder art.13 taken in conjunction with art.3 was also declared admissible (unanimous).(2) There had been no violation of art. 3 (six votes to one). Following an overall assessment ofthe detailed account of the applicant of his conditions of detention, the Court found that thehe was not subjected to distress or hardship which exceeds expected levels of sufferinginherent in the state of imprisonment. The judgment heavily relied on previous casesconcerning the same prison where the Court found the Maltese Government had committedno violation of art.3.(3) There had been a violation of art.13 taken in conjunction with art.3 (unanimous).(4) The State is required to pay the applicant EUR 5,000. Although no violation of art.3 hadbeen found, Mr Abdilla’s right to art.13 was not upheld as the applicant did not have accessto effective domestic remedies regarding his conditions of detention (unanimous).640 European Human Rights Law Review[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCases consideredAnanyev and Others v Russia (2012) 55 E.H.R.R. 18Čonka v.

Given that Malta had not been found in breach of art.3 in earliercases with similar facts and cases regarding the conditions of detention in the same facility, the Court feltthat it was not necessary to depart from its approach in this case. Judges Motoc and Bošnjak in their jointconcurring opinion argued that it is paramount to the Court’s integrity that the present case is dealt within the same manner as earlier cases. However, Judge Pinto de Albuquerque’s dissenting opinion isinteresting to the case as it highlights that although the previous cases relate to a different division withinCorradino Correctional Facility than the division discussed in the present case, and considering thesimilarity of complaints across the board as well as the report prepared by the Committee for the Preventionof Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment’s (CPT) report, the prison as a wholeobviously forces inmates to live in inhuman and degrading conditions.Despite the unfortunate outcome for the inmates, who keep challenging the conditions of detention atthe same facility, the case offers legal certainty and predictability as unless the conditions worsen, theCourt does not seem willing to find Malta in breach of art.3.Kaj HadadCase and Comment 641[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsBook ReviewsLa Charte des droits fondamentaux saisie par les juges en Europe—The Charterof Fundamental Rights as Apprehended by Judges in Europe, by LaurenceBurgorgue-Larsen (ed.), (Pedone, 2017), 716 pages, paperback, ISBN:978-2-23-300824-4.The book under review sets itself the ambitious task of surveying the use of the EUCharter of FundamentalRights (the Charter) by national courts and other stakeholders in 22 EU Member States. The merits ofempirical research with such a broad geographical scope can hardly be overstated. By yielding freshcomparative insights, this approach can significantly feed into the ongoing discussion of the Charter’slegal effects in the context of multi-level protection of fundamental rights in Europe. However, such acollective effort is fraught with potential pitfalls stemming from the divergences betweenMember States’legal systems and judicial practices, not to mention the practical difficulties of coordinating the work ofscholars from multiple Member States. Overall, while some of these obstacles have perhaps proved to beinsurmountable, the team of contributors under the direction of Laurence Burgorgue-Larsen provides acomprehensive account of the domestic reception of the Charter in the Member States covered.By way of introduction, the first chapter by François-Xavier Millet discusses the Charter’s scope ofapplication as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU), with a focus on the notion of“implementation of Union law” by Member States set forth in art.51 of the Charter. When it comes todetermining the level of protection under art.53 of the Charter, Millet fleshes out the CJEU’s approachby surveying different possible scenarios depending on the degree of harmonisation of secondary lawapplicable to the case at hand. He argues that the Charter has not radically transformed the EU’s fundamentalrights protection system, nor has it been invoked by the CJEU as an autonomous basis for enhancing thestandard of protection. Rather, the Charter has provided the Court with added legitimacy to pursue theconstitutionalisation of the Union’s legal order and to reinforce the Court’s autonomy, thereby transformingthe Court itself (p.31). This line of argument finds interesting echoes throughout the collection.The core of the book consists of 22 national reports written in French or English, predominantly byacademics but also other legal professionals. The chapters follow an identical pattern based on aquestionnaire addressed to individual contributors. The first section of each chapter covers the Charter’sformal status as defined by national constitutional law and the mentions of the Charter in democraticdeliberations and legislative texts. The second section is designed to provide a thorough assessment ofthe Charter’s role in national judicial proceedings. To begin with, it inquires into how national judgesinterpret the Charter’s scope of application defined in its art.51 and if they allow the Charter to be invokedin horizontal situations. It then examines the references to the Charter in decisions of constitutional andordinary courts and the approaches of these courts to issues surrounding the Charter’s art.53. Finally, itturns to the role of the Charter in references for a preliminary ruling and the invocation ex officio of theCharter by national courts. Emphasis is rightly placed on the interactions between the Charter, nationalconstitutions and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in national case law.The collection concludes with a synthesis report by Laurence Burgorgue-Larsen titled “Irreduciblediversity”. In an effort to pick up the central threads running through the 22 national analyses,Burgorgue-Larsen constructs two different mosaics, one constitutional and the other judicial. The formeris assembled by reviewing the differences in the Charter’s place in the hierarchy of norms and its role inconstitutional review, illustrating the varying degrees to which national constitutions have beenEuropeanised or internationalised. The latter is constructed by bringing together the remaining themesidentified in the questionnaire to paint a picture of the diversity in the Charter’s treatment by national[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors642courts. Given the difficulties of synthesising 22 Member State reports in the space of 20 pages, this finalchapter is more of a commentary than a fully fledged comparative analysis, but insightful nonetheless.Before acknowledging the book’s contribution to existing scholarship, several remarks are due on itsweaker points. As described above, the national reports strictly follow the same format, to the extent thateach questionnaire item is reproduced verbatim as a section heading. While this editorial decision addedcohesion to the collection, it remained an obstacle to developing a coherent narrative and contextualisingthe empirical findings. It also led to frequent repetitions of identical points within individual nationalreports due to significant overlaps between some sections of the questionnaire. Considering this, it is allthe more problematic that the book lacks a methodology section that would justify the chosen approachand the structure of the questionnaire. Finally, one can only regret that the panoramic view of the Charter’spresence on the national level is incomplete as six Member States are not covered,1 a decision explainedby the difficulty to find available researchers (p.6).Yet these observations in no way detract from the book’s principal strength, which lies in amassing animpressive number of detailed and targeted empirical studies on the Charter’s place in adjudication byMember State courts. Similar attempts had been made before but not with quite as much focus and editorialdirection.2 Most of the contributions offer a very nuanced discussion with ample reference to nationaldoctrine—the chapters on Germany, Belgium or Italy are cases in point. Notwithstanding the diversity ofjudicial approaches to the Charter, the collection reveals striking similarities among Member States in theway the Charter is invoked in judicial proceedings. Most notably, apart from several cases in which theCharter was applied in an autonomous manner and sometimes even led to a higher standard of protection,the Charter is typically cited alongside national constitutional provisions or the ECHR, and a reference toit rarely has any evident influence on the decision reached. What is particularly striking is the widespreadlack of judicial rigour on the part of national judges, who tend to “throw the Charter into the mix” by amere reference to its provisions without further discussion and often without justifying its applicability.The collection thus succeeds in exposing some of the current limits of EU fundamental rights adjudicationin Member State courts.In keeping with its design and purpose, the reviewed book does not fully explore the implications ofthe presented empirical findings, nor does it propose any solutions to the evident deficiencies in theCharter’s application by national judges. It nevertheless deserves attention for its rich comparative material,which will no doubt inform any subsequent critical discussions on the Charter’s role in fundamental rightsprotection.Petr MádrJoint PhD candidate, Université Paris 2 Panthéon-Assas, Charles University in Prague1Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Slovakia.2See, e.g. Société de législation comparée, “Mise en œuvre de la Charte des droits fondamentaux de l’Union européenne” (2012),www.legiscompare.fr/web/Mise-en-oeuvre-de-la-Charte-des?lang=fr [Accessed 21 May 2018].Book Reviews 643[2018] E.H.R.L.R., Issue 6 © 2019 Thomson Reuters and ContributorsCumulative IndexThis index has been prepared using Sweet & Maxwell’s Legal Taxonomy.Access to justiceEuropean Court of Human Rightscase law, 22—32
